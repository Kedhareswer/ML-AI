2023-09-30 00:42:10,Zalak Patel is a consummate PROFESSIONAL,"I hired Zalak to design my site based on two criteria: 1 She had a very fine portfolio. 2. More importantly, she asked me for my business, then asked again, then asked again.  I said yes and for the next year, was never sorry for a single moment.  First, she is a highly skilled and wonderful designer with an eye for art that is hard to find. 2. She has common sense and approaches her design as a customer centered business understanding that in the end, I needed to be satisfied and happy with her product, for her to be happy with her job; 3. I can absolutely trust her with my site, including passwords, and project funding (she was not only a designer but a great project manager). 4. She set me up with her own programmers in which I paid her and she paid them. She guaranteed them and she got what she wanted from the without damaging the site. (Something I had a hard time doing).  I found Zalak to be pleasant and personable.  She was always on time and always dependable and always did what she told me she would do.  I have hired dozens of talented off-shore programmers/designers and few do I give a recommendation and none do I give a full throated recommendation to, except to Zalak.  Call me any time in Missouri to talk to me.",5
2023-02-01 01:55:07,Love LinkedIn! But the app…,"Update: LinkedIn heard my prayers and fixed my app. I no longer get kicked out when trying to send direct messages, and the app works generally faster. Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to utilize this awesome app to its fullest potential again! 

Let me start out by saying that LinkedIn has changed my life in so many positive ways. I found my new career through the app, and started down a journey of positive personal development when I rejoined the platform. Hence the four stars. I needed to take one star away because, at least in the app, it almost always crashes and boots me out when I try to send a Direct Message to someone. I end up needing to go in and retype the message 2-3 times before it will send without crashing and closing out. I know plenty of other people are experiencing the same problem, because they post about it. Please fix this issue, I love this platform for so many reasons, but this is frustrating! Thank you in advance for your attention and all that you do to make LinkedIn the wonderful place that it is! Update: my app has worked perfectly since the last update. No more getting booted out when sending DMs. Thank you LinkedIn!",5
2023-10-25 11:39:30,Better as a creator,"LinkedIn was okay until I became a creator. It takes courage to post but over time, like 3-6 months, it becomes easier. At that point it becomes a lot more fun and now I look forward to using LinkedIn and this app every day. 

Not sure what to write? Use the 2 year, 2 day, or even 2 hour rule (credit Nicolas Cole). Just post what you would have benefited from had you known it 2 years ago, 2 days ago, or even 2 minutes ago!

Developers: thanks for your work on the app!! First request: wish the scheduled posts could be edited. Second request: wish commenting was just better organized for conversations. Like replying to a reply to a reply. Also wish that the best answers/comments filtered to the top. Would draw you in as a user to know that the first comments are the most valued by the community (when there are dozens of comments and you don’t want to sift through them all). Again thanks though for the great app!",5
2021-06-25 23:06:36,Need Auto-Saving for Drafts,"I spent about an hour carefully crafting a reply to a message, had assembled a bunch of links and useful information for the recipient, and had to navigate away from the app momentarily to grab a link. When I switched back to LinkedIn, the app opened to the main landing page and when I reopened the message I had been composing a reply to, the text field was empty. I lost an hour of work and I feel so frustrated, distraught, and disheartened. Auto-save for in-progress messages is pretty basic functionality for most messaging programs and if your app had had it, I wouldn’t be in this situation. I wish I could setup a LinkedIn auto-response that directs everyone who messages through LinkedIn me to contact me on a different interface, so that I could avoid using LinkedIn’s messaging tool entirely. 

Objectively, the app is basically fine aside from this issue and does not really deserve only one star. I’m just still reeling from the emotional blow of this experience and looking for an outlet for my frustration as well as to share this feedback with you while it’s fresh and in a way that will help your team feel the pain that can be caused by this product gap and really understand the impact. Thanks for reading.",1
2021-09-21 15:30:25,Unprofessional customer service and inaccurate algorithms,After using the application for quite a while that I have added too many connections that I have never talked to. So recently I was trying to clean up those connections. Because I didn’t find any option to delete all unused connections all at once so I just manually deleted them. All of sudden I received an system notification that I was using a third party software and restricted for log in in 1 hour. I was so frustrated that I never used anything like that and I was just simply cleaning up my unused connections. I mean if LinkedIn has the option to let me delete them all at once then I don’t need to manually delete one by one and create a ‘high volume’ as they claimed. It is the inaccurate algorithms that mark me as something called ‘using the the third party software’. In fact I don’t even know there exists this kind of third party software. The customer representative was like this is a done deal that you are using the 3rd party software and any tickets regarding to this would be closed automatically. So LinkedIn made a mistake that they don’t admit it. And the customer has no right to point it out! See this is the way how they treat their customers!,1
2023-08-26 04:46:05,Out of all the Options,"They are the most thorough platform available, full of many different types of new beginnings. However, I have not had quality customer support experiences with them. I have been trying to utilize a benefit that they offer veterans for some time now, and something is not working, but when I reach out to them for assistance, I get very little other than a vague response. I have contacted them on several occasions, but it’s still a mystery to me why this opportunity continues to elude me. I have given up hope, and I rarely use (or try to) the site anymore because of this. It makes me sad because I don’t have the resources and abilities I once possessed, and this is the best place for me to focus on what I CAN do and learn about new opportunities. I was looking forward to this being the beginning of the most lucrative and rewarding career in my lifetime. Yet, I have hit another stumbling block instead.",3
2023-09-11 12:47:38,API calls make UI stall,"Extremely buggy on iOS on iPhone 12 max. I’ve deleted the app and reinstalled. There’s some very badly managed API calls that feel like it’s using jQuery instead of a modern MVC framework causing every other scroll to click instead. I don’t understand why it became so much worse, or how QA engineers let this out the door. It’s very badly managed developers and software. This was not an issue at all a couple years ago, shortly after Microsoft bought LinkedIn. It is however unsurprising that the UI became much worse after MS got involved and MS has no design cycle nor do they have a QA cycle so it’s absolutely likely the UI will continue to get worse. Sigh, hopefully I’ll land a job so I don’t need to use this broken and frustrating UI much longer. The most frustrating part it I tried to tell LinkedIn and the customer support claimed the couldn’t replicate, which is funny because I tested on several iPhones. It’s gaslighting on their part. The whole customer support experience also reminded e of Microsoft, where thy just don’t believe you and assume the customer is doing something wrong. I don’t think they want to fix it.",1
2022-04-15 17:47:13,linkedin (and the rest of social media) has become terrible,"after being a paying premium linkedin member for years, my account was suddenly deleted by linkedin simply because i chose to talk openly with others on it about being treated for sickness i’ve dealt with that was related to the moderna vaccine - and trying to spread helpful information to others who may experience the same issue. i’m also a single parent trying to find work ASAP after the past two years of struggle. linkedin has been deleting actual doctors who have been trying to help with this stuff as well. it’s clear the people in linkedin’s trust & safety department don’t care about any of this and have joined the insane groupthink cult governing too many of these companies now, censoring anyone who might displease their advertisers, even to their userbase’s detriment. the fact that linkedin has started using engagement and suppression algorithms like twitter and facebook is making it an increasingly more toxic environment as well. i’ve switched to indeed. linkedin has become absolutely inhumane and will sink its own ship if this is how it continues to conduct business.",1
2022-08-15 05:59:38,please read,"I downloaded this app on my phone just so i could advise everyone not to use this website. For a senior project in my AP english class, everyone needs to create a LinkedIn account. Everything was going fine and I had spent about 3 hours working on the profile and only had about an hour or less of work left to do. The next day, I go to log in and there is an error message that says I need to submit ID due to suspicious activity. I talk to my teacher and this seems to be a problem with many other students. She contacts LinkedIn and they said it was due to a mass login on the same internet, and it will be fixed soon. The next day, very few students were still locked out, including me. I submitted my drivers license. The day after that, I was one of two students locked out. Skip a few days (3), and they FINALLY respond to me saying my account is permanently banned. I am now drastically behind in my class and this program is going to ultimately lead to my failure in this college class. I hope you guys fix your support team and maybe look at issues a little deeper before banning people.",1
2022-06-07 14:41:17,"Not able to access on cellular, only WiFi",I recently transferred Service from Verizon to AT&T. The LinkedIn app only works on Wi-Fi it does not work connected to cellular service. I have gone through all of the troubleshooting steps with AT&T as well as Apple. I’m on an iPhone 13 Pro. Everyone has said it is not an issue on their end that I should contact the developer. Please advise if there is some thing I can do to make this app push through on cellular service. The app is up-to-date with what’s available in the App Store for me. I use this app for business regularly and I’m currently only able to use it on my home computer or I also cannot access the LinkedIn website on a browser unless I am The app is up-to-date with what’s available in the App Store for me. I use this app for business regularly and I’m currently only able to use it on my home computer or my phone but must be connected to Wi-Fi. The strange part is on my phone I also cannot access the LinkedIn website on a browser unless I am connected to Wi-Fi. Please advise. Thank you.,2
2022-09-19 08:02:26,Atrocious customer service,"After being charged over $600 for a product I didn’t realize I even bought due to their confusing interface I am being refused a refund and sent the same generic message about their no refund policy over and over again. I have used this website for years and am appalled by their dishonest practice. If you decide to ever use this website or app don’t ever buy premium (it’s useless) and don’t ever put your card information on it or you might fall victim to what I’m going through. They make it too easy ti misinterpret something and buy something with an insane price tag without realizing what you’re agreeing to. The app is also poorly designed as well. If you check Trust Pilot and the Better Business Bureau, they have a one star rating which is a huge red flag. Personally I would say avoid at all costs and don’t ever give them any if your information except for the bare minimum. Don’t expect a transparent app, business practice or to ever any kind of real conversation with customer service. Avoid at all cost but if you must use it Keep your expectations extremely low.",1
2022-01-15 16:11:33,"One step forward, ten steps back","Updating my review (Jan 15, 2022): Everything below PLUS app freezes when trying to post or upload a photo. (Yes, I deleted and reinstalled.) No such thing as tech help from what I can see. Just consumer forums and FAQs. Down to 1 star and deleting from my phone. 

——

I used to enjoy this app, but it seems that it is getting less and less user-friendly on iPad and iPhone. For example, the landing page and profile page do not mirror the most important features that are on the laptop version. It would be nice to be able to easily view my recent updates and make changes to all of my profile sections--not just certain ones--from the app. A new thing I've noticed now is that some articles or links can't be opened in browser or forwarded through email/text. The ""forward"" arrow icon pops up with a ""cancel"" message instead and no other option. So weird. Sadly, the ""app support"" is just a forum of somewhat useless info, which is why I'm posting here. Hopefully the designers will read everyone's feedback on App Store and correct these issues in next update.",1
2023-03-29 19:36:19,Social Connect NOT for CAREER seekers or EMPLOYMENT hopefuls,"ONLY use for a self propped social site to highlight career accomplishments, this is in NO way a site assisting with career, employment, job, or training for such in any way. I don’t believe anyone in it’s history actually found or obtained relevant employment by association with this site. The app is disgraceful with countless & continuous problems, the functions, features & customizations are only there to frustrate since no real functionality, majority if not all content from being contacted will be not or scam derived with no reportable solution for removal. If you have the time to waste, money to flush for the Pro version yet love advertisement inserts along with pro paying versions, lack of responsive support services & never getting much in return then you Will absolutely adore & promote this bug infested nightmare…there’s way better available if a serious job seeker, career hopeful & educated enough to avoid this mess individual or business looking for hires. Hope this fades from App Store listings & internet history quickly for everyone’s sake, the world could only improve for it doing so.",1
2022-07-16 16:40:09,LinkedIn engages in profiling through barring certain searches,"While I have benefitted from certain services that LinkedIn provides such as LinkedIn learning, LinkedIn no longer appears to serve the individual user as much as it serves corporate recruiting efforts and corporate advertising.
I work for a large educational system, which by this time has hundreds and hundreds of individual users with LinkedIn profiles, and while manually searching through a number of these profiles, the software app recently tried to force me into signing an agreement that I would voluntarily limit future searches through my own organizational network for others to connect with to a certain undisclosed, arbitrary number chosen by LinkedIn without any further information from LinkedIn to me or face suspension of my account by the app. The software has not allowed me any further access to my own profile until I sign that agreement. I strongly recommend avoiding this glorified recruitment service in favor of other newer, more personable services which allow the user to be more in control of his or her own searches.",1
2022-04-20 06:47:21,Racist platform - sells your ID on the Dark Web,"When I first joined LinkedIn I had support help me consolidate two accounts and that wasn’t an issue. Then because I debated some racists and debunked their lies, LinkedIn decided I was the guilty party and suspended my account. They demanded a copy of my ID front and back and/or passport. My identity could’ve been verified through my contacts who are high level attorneys, CEOs and even the Chamber of Commerce of which I am a member and LinkedIn sees that. They refused to reinstate my account. They’re racists as revealed by an article in NY Times in 2019! 

I then created another account and rebuilt my profile. After a while LinkedIn seeing I was getting a lot of traction to my posts restricted my account again this time claiming I had two accounts AND I NEEDED to provide a passport or ID again! These people are insane! Suddenly my credit report warned that my email address was compromised and was found on the dark web! Guess who did this? Yes, LinkedIn. This company is a racist lying bunch of thieves and you should really avoid it at all cost. It’s no longer the professional platform it once was.",1
2018-03-27 05:14:36,Serious VoiceOver accessibility problems,"I am a blind person using the screen reader voiceover for iOS and I am having some serious VoiceOver accessibility problems. For one thing, in the new version, when I double tap on my Contacts, the app crashes every time. Secondly, when I am browsing through my people you may know section, the app get slower and slower and slower the longer eyebrows. Thirdly, if you were using voiceover, there is no option to remove someone from your people you may know list so that you do not see them anymore. The accessibility problems with this app used to be somewhat minimal. I am really looking forward to seeing this app fixed and using LinkedIn again. It is one of my favorite social networking platforms.  I apologize if other people are bored by this review, but LinkedIn also does not have any where in the app or on the app support page to provide feedback about the app. I would also be kind of nice if developer of LinkedIn provided details about its updates in its release notes, but many App developers don’t do this. It’s just a pet peeve.",2
2019-06-13 21:38:07,Horrible Interface,"I swear this site has provided me with so much stress just trying to set it up. I didn’t dropped out of college and I left my job but they are both in my interests and I cannot change them. Whenever I open the app it tells me to finish updating my profile but I don’t have anymore information to add. There’s no way to say no. When I tried to leave things blank because they don’t apply to me I couldn’t. I got a notice that I had shown up in a search but when I opened the notification I was taken to a page within the app that did not work without a laptop. Why would this happen on the mobile app? It makes no sense. I’ve made all the connections I want to for now but every time I open the app I have to skip through the page to make connections with random people I don’t know. This app and the website are infuriating to attempt to use. I use all kinds of other social media that work at least decently. This platform is by far the most angering to use. Maybe the team is overworked or has no time to fix these issues, but they are too glaring and long lasting to still be around.",1
2023-06-17 20:15:01,Terrible tech support as a professional platform,"LinkedIn closed my account for absolutely no reason.

After I’ve updated the Linkedin App, I was asked to re-login, but instead of logging into my existing account, it created a new profile for me, completely blank. I was confused at first but was still able to search up my old account and thought of it as a tech glitch. I reached out to the service team and waited a few days before reaching out again, after they said they’ll transfer my case to another team. By now I can no longer find my old account and am panicking, since it contains all my connections and the profile that I’ve built long and hard for.

The team responded saying my account is restricted permanently for misrepresenting my identity, after I’ve provided my ID, and closed my case with no other details. Now I’m stuck with no information and a brand new account and no access to any of my past connections. I have offered the team to provide any relevant info to verify my past work/volunteering experiences, but I am just greatly disappointed by LinkedIn tech support.

I’ve been patience since the start and comply with the rules, despite the great inconvenience that this has caused me work-wise, but I’m simply frustrated now that I may never get my account back for absolutely no reason. Apparently this has been an issue for many people and I don’t understand why it continues to be one, being one of the most professional platform used by thousands.",1
2021-05-19 01:27:07,Only sort of useful,"An account is basically required by potential employers if you’re applying to white collar jobs, but is incredibly difficult to sort thru or actually get a response from companies- especially if you are applying thru linkedin itself. Would recommend only using the app to find companies that sound interesting, vetting them thru glassdoor, then applying via the company website itself.
Suggestion 1 for better UX: limit applications to 100 per job with job listings closing automatically upon hitting 100 apps received. I am tired of seeing open job listings with 100+ applicants because i KNOW that the hiring managers are only skimming the top 5% of applicants from the pile and then underpaying them for their experience. 
Suggestion 2 for better UX: Years of required experience being listed as a filter within job listings search. I am not interested in a job that pays entry level wages or says “fast paced environment” and then requires 5-7 years of experience AND a bachelors.",2
2020-08-17 17:02:17,Notification Issues,"I’m a job seeker and I’ve been using LinkedIn to aid in my search. However, I’m afraid of missing a job opportunity as whenever I get a push notification I never hear any sound, unlike with my other apps. I always see a red number on my LinkedIn app widget showing me how many new notifications I have however I never hear any sound. All other sounds seem to be working which leads me to believe it’s an app issue rather than a phone issue or operator error somewhere. Please help! Thanks!

Also, unless I’m just missing it, I would LOVE the ability to select a custom notification sound within the app so I can identify a LinkedIn notification from all others. Thank you! Be safe!

Oh! One thing I did forget to add is that I LOVE the section called “My Next Job Should Offer Me” where we’re able to specify benefits we’re asking for as well as the schedule we need. Oh and the Name Pronunciation feature is fantastic!!! Thank you!!!",3
2023-09-26 21:14:20,Privacy,"LinkedIn excels as a premier platform for professional networking and career advancement, proving indispensable for job seekers and employers alike. It offers a rich array of features and a user-friendly interface that facilitates dynamic interactions and professional development. 
💡 However, it could significantly benefit from enhanced privacy settings, allowing users to conceal the start dates of their career experiences to combat the prevalent issue of ageism in the professional realm. 

Just like in the education section of a user's profile, this added flexibility would enable individuals to showcase their skills and experiences without the constraint of timelines, promoting a more inclusive professional environment. Overall, LinkedIn stands as a powerful tool for career progression, but adopting more nuanced privacy features would further its commitment to fostering equitable and diverse professional communities.",4
2023-09-16 20:19:37,Need more options,"When a job expires I can’t see it on the app only on the actual website. 
There’s to be a way to archive old jobs that I’ve applied to. 
When applying to jobs externally it reroutes you to a different web browser entirely so you don’t lose your application. 
Is there a way to add quick swipe left so when there’s a job that you’re not interested in you can hide it?
It would also be nice to add a filter to where you can check “see only see United States jobs available for anyone in the United States and the state you live in for remote jobs instead of the app showing for example “Chicago, IL United States” and you can apply for these jobs because the job poster only wants candidates from that area state. This would make job searching a lot faster.",4
2023-07-03 09:12:53,Show me your papers! Repeatedly suspended.,"I have used LinkedIn for the last time. There is so much effort in building a LinkedIn profile and like other texh giants,"" they"" have the ability to suspend one's account. It may be automatic, it may be AI or it may be someone clicking buttons. It could have been me making a joke, asking, ""What? No fact chexking?"" to a post where someone said, ""Wrong is wrong, even if everybody is doing it and right is right, even if nobody is doing it."" Whatever the reason, they have shown me repeatedly that this is not a platform that I can trust or depend on when I need it. I resisted giving them my government issued ID to regain access to my account, the last time this happened and eventually, ""I Loved Big Brother,"" like at the end of 1984. I sent them
my ID and they still did not unlock my account. The promose was broken and was just a lie. They feel that they have power over us but it only works if we cooperate.",2
2019-11-19 17:50:15,Changes to LinkedIn.,"I too am very disappointed with LinkedIn and the direction it has taken. 
This previously was a great site for people to communicate with other people and companies. Whether it was trying to get a job, improving their position, finding a new workplace due to moving to a new area or trying to move up to a better job, talking with others about how to improve their job skills so they can prepare for a better job or keeping in touch with friends they worked with in the past or, even better, finding old friends and learning how to stay in touch with them. It WAS a great site. 
Now, as the previous commenter said, LinkedIn is now just another Facebook or Twitter. It’s totally lost all the professionalism it started with. 
If anyone in power within the LinkedIn organization reads this comment, please, please, PLEASE change the format back to what the original people or person had as their vision. If you don’t, I can foresee this site going down the tubes. I, for one, will do my best to start a new site with only one goal... to make a website for companies and individuals to get together and help each other grow both as a company and as individuals who want to help a company grow and a company willing to help their dedicated individuals grow within the company. 
Also, have learning institutions small and large contribute to the individuals growth.
Is anyone out there with me on this?",2
2021-07-08 22:41:42,Needs improvement,I was just trying to apply to a job on LinkedIn. They said to contact the employer by email and provided the email. When I press and hold LinkedIn does not allow you to select text to copy and paste into your mail. The email is also not a link I can click on to email. I unfortunately have to manually type in the long email letter by letter going back and fourth. Please fix this. I was also recently searching for jobs and reading a number of job descriptions. Many were in my field but did not apply to me. I would like to be able to hide them so I don’t see them in the future. Don’t see a way to do this. I only see Apply and Save buttons; no hide. When viewing a clients portfolio web link and clicking on it nothing happens within LinkedIn. This link should open up in Safari; I can not copy/paste it into Safari either and have to go back and fourth typing letter by letter.,2
2019-06-17 21:25:14,The absolute worst networking app...,"LinkedIn is the absolute worst, corrupt, and non user friendly social app out there. There are too many reasons to even begin mentioning all of them. Just to name one: if a user wants to unfriend or leave a group, LinkedIn intentionally makes it impossible to do so on the mobile app.

I’m also still dealing with a “glitch” that the app had a few years ago. Without giving any permission to access my iPhone’s contacts, LinkedIn automatically dumped every one of my LinkedIn contacts into my iPhone’s contacts. Well over 500 contacts were combined with my personal contacts. Not a big deal you say? Well those contacts birthdays were then automatically also added to iPhone’s calendar. Everyday I would have at least a couple of these birthdays showing. For well over a year I was manually removing these contacts one name at a time. LinkedIn admitted to the error. Thanks that did nothing to help. So at this point I have zero trust in the integrity, honesty, or reliability of LinkedIn.",1
2018-12-14 00:13:49,Chronological content feed - second attempt.,"LinkedIn... I love your platform. I have already posted a comment on the lack of a sort by “recent” function on for iOS. When I’m on my phone, the work around is to go to your mobile site, then request the desktop site, then select “sort by: recent”. The most recent update you just pushed out now has “lives” or something that feels like a clone of Instagram/YouTube/Snapchat/Facebook, etc. I do not subscribe to these platforms because I believe LinkedIn is the only social media platform of any substance. There is quality content and networking happening everyday. Why did your newest update add a cookie-cutter “lives” function and not a simple “sort by:recent” function. Why am I seeing 3 week old posts with recent posts scattered about. Totally ridiculous... The one platform I thought was doing a service to a community of professional people is slowly becoming just another social media platform.",2
2023-10-25 14:40:23,Account was Banned?,"I log in to see that my account was banned and have to verify??? That’s never happened to me before and there’s no reason stating what “suspicious activity” is being done? Even to get help as in a support ticket, or via email, you have to sign in but I CAN’T because my account is banned for no apparent reason! You guys need to seriously state the specific reasons as to why accounts are banned because I haven’t done anything but use your guys clarify app to get verified and also apply to jobs and post my degree so what’s the reason I’m so called “banned” for? Your customer service is horrible as well.. they’re should definitely be an easier way to contact someone other than being a member because you ban us for no reason and it’s impossible getting a hold of you guys. At that, it doesn’t even state WHEN our accounts will be off banned mode or how long it takes for them to verify. It’s ridiculous. I wouldn’t recommend this app.",1
2022-06-12 14:48:01,Not able to open an app on my iPhone,Until a few days ago I was able to open and converse through my LinkedIn app on my iPhone 7 Plus now all of a sudden it doesn’t open up I’ve deleted it I’ve installed updates on my iPhone I’ve done everything it said and every time I download the LinkedIn app it won’t open up I don’t know what’s going on I can access it on a regular computer but for some reason I can’t access it through the app on my iPhone I don’t know if I’m having the same issue as the person before me that wrote about not being connected to Wi-Fi Not being able to access itbut I was able to even get itWithout Wi-Fi about a week ago I don’t understand what’s going on,5
2023-06-27 19:05:04,Bad SEO,"This app is really frustrating to use. When looking at a company’s open roles, I can’t filter by location because it will just reset the search to all jobs in that location, not restricting to the company whose page I was just on. If I try to restrict further by searching the company name, all these unrelated jobs show up in the search. This doesn’t happen on desktop so I’m not sure why it’s happening on mobile. 
Also the filters aren’t very functional - so many jobs that are included in the “entry level” filter but require 7+ years experience, or are marked as fully remote but are actually fully in person. The jobs I’m recommended aren’t even close to the field or function of my current roles. My home feed is just full of fake inspirational posts about CEOs deigning to give their employees breadcrumbs and people foaming at the mouth over their “generosity”. It’s not a good tool anymore.",2
2021-12-26 04:08:09,eh,"I honestly have never written a review before, but I left LinkedIn because of this when I was fond of building connections on LinkedIn. However,  someone had to make me very uncomfortable. LinkedIn is for professional use. When posting, there should be a  sensitivity filter so what ever comment or post is being shared on LinkedIn directly is not hurtful or disrespectful. I had a horrible experience with someone disrespecting my profession and the person said “in ms your considered a joke” on my post that involved my profession having an appreciation week. 
That is the total opposite of what LinkedIn in is used for.

Update: it’s sad to see that my review was overlooked and not cared about. Bullying or any form of making someone uncomfortable especially on a professional job app should be taken seriously. You should be able to post about your profession without someone trying to undermine a position. What a shame.
Adding on to my review: I hope LinkedIn is able to talk with him, and give him a warning. 
It’s sad because I did not want to leave LinkedIn, but because of this behavior that should not be tolerated I left and it was probably for the best. I just wanted to be recognized for all the hard work I do for my job and post it on my page and someone had to ruin it all. I know it’s not you LinkedIn, but I hope you can help me.",2
2020-01-03 00:26:58,Horrible,The newest update has them limiting your preferences for your job search an forcibly showing you state wide jobs like that helps. If  someone like myself has set up job preferences why take them away and why start showing jobs to them that are outside of their preferences like a job search isn't already hard enough and tiring enough. Now I'm every time I open the app instead of being able to scroll through the recommendations I have to create different searches because the jobs recommended to me are 8+ hours away and don't interest me in the slightest. Just because I live in a state doesn't mean I'm comfortable commuting far and doesn't mean I'm trying to relocate to the opposite side of it. So who's dumb idea was it to add that useless and annoying feature that shows jobs to people outside their now very limited preferences. I don't want to be shown state wide jobs and according to the customer service rep it's a feature I can't manually get rid of. Dumbest update to date.,1
2020-04-18 14:34:58,Please add an unlimited word count,"I love LinkedIn, but would like to see an unlimited word count.  There are so many times that I have a post that exceeds the allotted word count and it’s frustrating.  I could condense what i need to say most times, but sometimes I need to be able to say more than what LinkedIn allows.  

If the post is good, people will read it. If not, they don’t have to read it and can just scroll on past.  I’m sure if you took a poll from other LinkedIn users, you would find that most of them would agree that LinkedIn needs an unlimited word count.  Don’t limit it solely for the purpose of making sure people’s posts are shorter.  Give people the opportunity to add as much as they need to their posts.  Sometimes you need to be able to add more to your post to properly say what you need to say because tightening your word count doesn’t always cut it.",3
2018-01-16 01:51:49,Option to improve feed needs to be improved,"The app is solid and very easy to use. My complaints are the content in the Feed and that the option “improve my feed” really offers no real options except adding new people to follow. It should be flexible and let you choose what you want to see more of OR less of. For example, in my feed I don't need to see every single time a connection “likes” something. I also remember I always used to see when my current connections connected to new people. I used to see those a lot every day. That was helpful info if a contact connected to someone new in my industry. It worked well in conjunction with the other “people I may know” info. I almost never see those types of updates anymore in my feed. Can you explain why the feed offers me zero flexibility to see the things that are most important to me?",3
2023-06-07 16:48:52,The app for fake people,"Most of the content I’ve encountered on this app is fake. Fake people with their fake jobs and fake integrity awards. No. These are the lowest most untrustworthy people on the planet.  Sorry but I can’t play your charades. The job section is a hot mess. More fake advertisements than Indeed and that’s hard to beat. Then you have a bunch of fake made of companies with their websites that took them under and hour to make. Are people still being fooled? Most of the jobs that are real are expired and outdated or closed. It just a stalker app. Provides no real business connections or opportunities.
if you try to delete the profile they still want to advertise you for up to 2 more weeks. Sorry but when I delete you no longer have the option to do anything with my personal information. This app is useless. Just people spying on me or sending odd spam email. I can’t wait until I figure out how to reclaim my information from these jerks!",1
2023-04-27 15:28:21,Needs improvement FIX FIX FIX,"It’s driving me bananas but if you search for a job and put one of the filters on (company, date posted, industry, function etc) sometimes if you put a second filter on, it will remove the first filter. Please please please fix this. I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max and am running the newest IOS software. It is driving me crazy.

Also!! When you go to select “company” there are many companies that you are able to choose from or you can search for one, you should make one of the defaults be the company the person is currently at or ones that they search a lot not random jobs. It doesn’t make sense why the default ones aren’t based on frequency. 

I don’t understand how such a powerful and renown company can have so many bugs with their searching features. Hire more engineers. It’s unfortunate there is nothing like LinkedIn because I would love to use anything that doesn’t make me want to rip my hair out.",1
2022-04-30 14:51:14,Atrocious Algorithms,"I’ve wasted my time for years with Indeed trying to search for jobs, and most of the wasted time is related to having to get through the pile of unrelated jobs thrown at me without any relevance to my job search. It doesn’t matter how deeply I attempt to tweak my search, get rid of unrelated jobs or even supply comments to this company as to why their jobs are irrelevant - they keep on sending jobs that have absolutely no connection to my search criteria. Indeed could apply a significant fix by limiting job results to only those which have the exact match in the job title, but that’s not an option. Why not? Because Indeed gets paid for the number of times a job shows up in a search, not whether it has no relevance. “Failed algorithms which waste job seekers time” - I suspect that this is the vision statement for Indeed. I depend on LinkedIn instead, and so should everyone else: Same jobs, but less wasted time and effort.",1
2021-07-09 02:32:50,What is going on !!!!,"I’m a huge fan of LinkedIn but Im unable to access anything right now!!! I am not unable to respond to my messages, or update anything….as soon as I try I am forced to open the app that at first said I didn’t have an account so I reset my password….. even though I just had it open online…. now the app won’t open because it’s prompting me to fill out a page about my future job hopes and dreams that goes blank when I attempt to response. I don’t understand why I can’t use my online account anymore apps aren’t dependable!! All I wanted to do is update my resume and read some articles! I apologize for my frustration I know it’s an app thing! Please please please fix this issue!!!",5
2019-12-11 14:48:05,Feel abandoned,"My LI app will no longer run, I'm forced to upgrade the app, but my iPhone doesn't support the new minimum de for the latest app. Sad LI made that decision to not support earlier sw versions :( and being in transition spending $1k on new phone isn't the smartest idea right now. Laptop only going forward :(

Still abandoned- their support said delete app and reload, there was hope as when I was reloading it said that it would load the sw that was compatible with my phone and that some features may not work. Ha, who knew the feature that wouldn't work was the app itself... they have a screen that comes up stating ""update for the latest sw"" but you can't get out of that loop, my phone doesn't support latest iPhone sw so it can't get the latest LI download. A silly loop they could correct if they wanted, I guess they don't want to, they closed my case because I didn't respond back in the hour, like all I have to do is mess with this app, ugh. Now you know why I feel abandoned...",1
2023-10-07 04:26:30,Scam,"They do not show you the jobs if you don’t pay them $34 per month. Which is expensive, because the same jobs are also on google too. 
They have scammers who impose as HR people, even doing fake interviews. If you report this to LinkedIn, they do not recognize it as a scam. 
I had an interview where I needed to perform a difficult 2 days test and an interview where the boss was racketeering me and harassing me. I also found more complaints about this particular company on google and Reddit but LinkedIn says, there is nothing wrong with them. Out of 200 applications, maybe 30 will download your file but only 11 will open your file. It means their platform is full of fake jobs. I have been applying for jobs straight to the companies and I know for sure they were not seeking for anyone but LinkedIn would post a job from those companies. Scam, a lot of scam. They just want your money. I was better off without them",1
2019-10-28 17:21:50,Great app but...,"I love this app however it frustrates me that the current job title seems to be the only factor that is included when recruiters are delivered search results.  As a consultant, my title can be anything and it may be quite different from my functional role and area of expertise.  Depending upon the currently listed job title, I’ve noticed a sharp difference in the number contacts I receive from recruiters and the roles they are seeking.  I wish that other factors such as education, certifications and skills would be considered when recruiters are delivered search results.  Also, LinkedIn should allow subscribers to search by certification or certificate.  Currently a search for common certifications returns no results despite the fact that these certifications are listed within job descriptions.",4
2018-09-13 01:23:39,App crashes and crashes again.,"I downloaded the app again because I thought it would be easier to use on my phone. I’ve been using it for about 30 minutes and it has crashed 3 times. It crashed while I was sending a request to connect. I was attaching a message to this request because the person doesn’t know me. Now, It has sent the request and I can’t finish my message. I don’t know if it attached what I typed already or not. Given that LinkedIn is a tool to help people network and make professional connections, this is more than frustrating. Now, to reach out to this person, I would have to pay for a premium account and use “in mail.” I’ll not be using the app anymore which is a serious inconvenience. I stopped using the Linked In app years ago because it would lead to accidental connection requests while scrolling through searches or suggested connection.",2
2020-10-02 06:42:49,Hate speech from other LinkedIn members and employees,"Not a safe place to have a professional opinion in most professions. Especially if you are a women. LinkedIn does not respect women whom have professional scientific reasoning and professional opinions that vary from the political slant posted by either a member or otherwise linkedin; however LinkedIn will continue to push the political slant into your feed continually inviting you to acknowledge the political topic which is slanted and not academically or professionally sound. If you don’t like it and if you contribute your intelligent, professional and academically sound comment LinkedIn members state hate things to a person such as Members stating hate statement to me and others I have witnessed ). Very disappointed in the lack of professionalism from LinkedIn employees whom allow the members and themselves to be so hateful to women and others on LinkedIn whom state professional scientific academically sound verbiage on a topic.",1
2022-04-28 15:31:43,NOT for dedicated job seekers,"This platform is no longer useful for finding a job. The app does all of what it can to keep the user locked in to the feed section. If I’m reviewing a job and my screen lock becomes active (or view something off of the app), when I return to the app, I am immediately taken to my feed. When I go back to the job section, the job I was reviewing is no longer visible. I’m sure it’s not deleted. It’s just hard to tell which one I was viewing, especially if you’re searching for similar jobs. It’s like as soon as you put your phone down, you lose place in line. It creates nothing but wasted time.

For anyone who has experienced a layoff, unemployment is a lot of work and it can easily wear you out. The last thing a person needs is a tool that slows them down. Of course a person can look elsewhere for jobs but why even have a job section if it has basic flaws.",1
2021-04-13 22:47:28,Useful but opportunities for improvement,"LinkedIn is the prime social networking app for professionals. Main avenue for jobs and all that.

I think here’s some opportunities for improvement:

1. Make a filter for company size when looking for jobs. 

2. A lot of recruiters post contracts as “full-time” as a sneaky way to get more applicants since they consider a full time role 40 hrs/week. Make this differentiation even clearer by saying “Permanent Full-Time.” I don’t know how many contract roles I’ve seen saying it’s Full-Time and luckily I read every description pretty carefully.

3. Make an option for when Looking For Work is turned on, we can put more details for recruiters to see. I get hit up for temp/contracts all the time and have no interest in them. Recruiters don’t bother reading profiles.

4. It would be great to have an option to rate or leave feedback on recruiters when you are communicating with them. Just like you have automatic “Yes/Not interested” responses, there should be a way to leave feedback on recruiter accounts since so many recruiters are rude, ghost candidates, post things unrelated to your field/interests, solicit, etc.",4
2023-10-10 17:54:10,Paid experience is same as free experience,"I used a linked in free profile for a while and when I was on the job market decided to try premium. I had it for a few months past the free trial, used it multiple times a week, but soon realized I didn’t see any difference in the experience. No better prospects, never got any interest in my profile even though I opted to let recruiters see me. I even optimized my profile based on suggestions and no discernible difference in engagement or connections. Decided to cancel premium but then found out that I couldn’t go back to my free profile (perhaps even they know there is no difference!) I had to erase my whole profile just to stop paying for a service that offered no real service! It is annoying because now I can’t even use LinkedIn links (like when someone send me a job I might be interested in) without making a new free profile.",1
2017-12-20 16:50:28,iPhone X,"Number one, if your application in the Apple IDs door would support a dialog box when selecting apps support I would be writing this in that dialog box and not under reviews. My review is based on the fact that Face ID is not used by LinkedIn. LinkedIn‘s responses leave your app signed in. I do not wish to do that, the information in the app is too private for me to take LinkedIn suggestion. The technology for Face ID has been incorporated to I would say 70 percent of the applications at this point, so it tells me that updating your app to use this functionality cannot be that difficult. I’ll be waiting for the Face ID recognition in your app soon. I would use your out more by not having to manually put in my password, holding the phone to your face makes my motivation to use your application what greater than having to use my large fingers To type in my password. Thank you, John",2
2022-10-25 16:15:31,Messaging has become terrible and extremely frustrating,"The main thing I use LinkedIn for is messaging and the past couple of months with these updates the messaging has gone so downhill with more glitches and bugs than ever it makes me not even want to use it. Sometimes I click on a person to message and it just never pulls up the conversation or freezes when I am trying to hit send. Also, when you have a search going, it now disappears the moment you click out of the app to read a text or something which makes you have to keep putting in what you are searching for and it never used to do that.  This app used to be great before they ruined it with pointless updates that only made things worse with no noticeable improvements. I would have rated 5 stars before these updates if that tells you how frustrating this has become.",1
2023-08-23 01:18:02,Warning about LinkedIn Terrible,I had a LinkedIn account that I ran my photography business through messaging & sharing with customers sharing links they would send me and me to them. After at least five years of using the App LinkedIn stopped letting me log into my account asking for verification on KYC which I provided after about two months and the account still not able to login. I inquiring as to why the account was shutdown and not letting me login. LinkedIn finally has sent me an email saying that I have shared post or links they don’t want being forwarded. No warnings in five years of being loyal to the brand and they kicked me to the curve like I an ugly dog to them. It really hurt my business and feelings that this is as good as it gets in business today use at your own risk don’t put nothing on the platform you want to keep because I was locked out. I shared a few Crypto links?,1
2019-04-09 23:46:19,Responding to recruiters new feature is terrible,"In the past when I was contacted by a recruiter in my message inbox, I could respond directly to the recruiter. Now, the app forces you to respond whether or not you are interested in the job before you have a chance to respond. To me this is a 100% unnecessary feature and is an unprofessional way to contact a recruiter to express interest. The right way to treat a recruiter is to write that person directly and let them know your intentions, perhaps including some background for your decision. This can help keep communication channels open in the future and is a networking opportunity. This new feature is a result of someone “overthinking” the situation. This goes back to the old saying, “If its not broke, don't fix it”",4
2022-01-21 01:15:18,Horrible app/ Customer service,"The app/ website is difficult to use and the UI is as good as a brick. Windows 98 is easier to use. You can’t contact customer support via the phone, at all. If you can’t log in you can’t get to their email to contact them and when you finally hear back it’s “violated terms of service” and will not elaborate. IV read the TOS and there’s nothing I’m doing wrong. Can’t use the app/website on multiple devices or it will lose its ****. Relies on community mangers to help solve claims but it dosent help at all. I had to google a phone number and email to put in a support ticket while being locked out of my account. The phone goes to an automated voice that only tells you, to refer to their help tab that has useless information. LinkedIn needs competition because this is a huge pain to deal with. I strongly suggest you look for an alternative to LinkedIn.",1
2018-10-24 02:58:31,Professional Networking Tool,"LinkedIn is my preferred way to interact with business professionals. I do, however, wish that the site would allow a longer time to deactivate an account or allow one to restore their account within a year. I deactivated my account for a “spiritual hiatus” and attempted to set my account back up and was unable to retrieve it. I built a great network before and now it seems like I am not getting as many recommendations for people that I knew from college and other businesses. 😏 I’m sure my post sounds like a combination of great things and not so great things, but I do really appreciate the fact that the tool is much more professional than most social media outlets.",5
2023-10-13 14:14:39,I need more dots on my die!,"This is one super cool, fast paced, never boring but it does make you want shout! Absolutely one of the best games I’ve played online ever. This game wants you to advance extremely fast, quick and easy. But it also shows you how to manipulate, destroy and leave one of your friends broken, broke and mad because I chose to leave their building’s destroyed so they have to fix them. That costs more money, money is a big deal in this game. Everything costs money and breaking into your opponents bank and stealing their life’s savings is a bit evil, but I had fun doing it and it was worth the risk. The farther I put him back the further I can get a head.",5
2021-12-07 20:04:29,Love LinkedIn - hate this one tiny bug,"Please please please for all that is good and holy, please make it so when you connect with someone on the app, it pops up a “personalize invite” modal like it does on the desktop version. Or make the desktop version work like the mobile version (but the desktop flow is better IMO). The amount of times discrepancy between the two platforms has caused me to accidentally send an invite to early & blow a connection because I connect, want to personalize, and then can’t, and then need to withdraw and wait 3 (THREE!!) weeks before I can resend is just bonkers. Please please please fix this and I will come back and make this review 5 stars and love you forever. LinkedIn is a great platform, and could be a lot bigger than it is with people spending more time on it. They don’t because little stuff like this drives us wild.",2
2019-01-09 19:15:26,"Freezes, Can’t apply for jobs, links don’t work! NEEDS THE TO BE FIXED!","I’ve heard so many people speak highly of LinkedIn, so I tried it out. Unfortunately this app does NOT work, as it needs serious updates.  When you try to apply for any of the job listing your are given the option to give permission to attach your LinkedIn profile in replace or your resume, it does NOT work. Once you click you get a white screen or when it does go through to the next screen where it will ask for your name and contact info it freezes. Therefore you can not apply for any of their job listings. So I look up the company on google to find their website and then apply that way  with my own resume. 
The only thing LinkedIn is good for right now is to locate a job listing. Then apply on their site.  
I gave 1 star because at least they still proved job listing I can apply to on the companies web site directly.",1
2017-10-31 15:30:28,Horrible interface,"This is a perfect example of what NOT to do in mobile app design. 
1. Useless messenger button that does nothing but try and get you to download the app by popping not one, but two screens (if you don’t have it).  I won’t load Facebook Messenger because it won’t let me select no tracking without constantly being harassed. 
2. Extremely small “x” for closing annoying ad windows so that if you have any normal or larger than normal finger (god forbid you try and use your thumb) then you end up opening the item instead. 
3. Allowing you to block some advertisers for only 30-Days at a time??? Seriously. If it wasn’t bad enough that you show me adds from advertisers I’ve already blocked, now you’re unblocking them after 30 Days??
4. Extremely small “x” for closing annoying recommended groups windows so that if you have any normal or larger than normal finger (god forbid you try and use your thumb) then you end up opening the item instead. Can I just get you to stop recommending stuff to me? I’m not sure what algorithm you use but the recommendations are horrible. 
5. Translations are rarely ever correct. Give up here and just license Google’s translator. I’m not saying Google Translate is good, but it would at least be correct more than your translations are. 

There are more, I’m sure. But we will stop here.",1
2021-06-15 15:43:58,Great app. Unsubscribe from emails before Earth Dies.,"In all complete honesty, LinkedIn as a great app and it’s net work is good, but seriously, the amount of emails that you get from this company probably emits as much greenhouse gas as mining bitcoin. It’s in my opinion, one of the biggest email cloggers I have yet to experience. I have the rest of my life to see one that is worse, but challenge accepted, I guess.

I’ve been on this app since I was under 18 and I’m 27 now. I have spent many an hour clearing these LinkedIn emails, and it’s to the point where I fully understand that it could potentially be causing a detriment of heat to the earth due to the amount of emails they send out to literally anybody who is on planet earth and has an account. You will get carpal tunnel from swiping these emails into archive.",3
2023-06-06 19:40:47,"App is still terrible, customer service is worse","In the age of TikTok and Instgram, still bans and kicks you off for no reason, but spam accounts selling test prep are fine. Apparently if you are looking for jobs and networking and you’re using the app they will “ban” or “restrict” your account with no explanation except for “we’ve detected automated activity” I’m using the linkedin app on my iPhone! Why the developers don’t implement some features to deter actual automated activity such as: -Have users take a selfie, like Uber Driver app does -Remind users they have been scrolling for too long, like tiktok does -Tell users what the “threshold” for use is instead of having a “blackbox” and then issuing a ban. This is probably the worse customer experience/ user experience in an app ever! Should we use your app or not? Do we use your app and then get banned for no reason!? Linkedin Dev team please address this!!",1
2021-08-19 12:22:22,Very buggy app,"The app does its job in working the same as desktop. However, the notifications only work 1/10 times. In fact, most times you try to click an external link that will open the app, the app opens on an all black or all white screen and stays there. You have to force close the app to have it load normal again but if you were trying to see what the notification was about, I hope you have good memory. 

The app also does not hold your place in the feed so clicking anything for example a url will open their in-app window and returning will refresh your feed. Since LinkedIn is built on an algorithm to keep you interested in the app, you most likely won’t ever see that post again as it generates new items it thinks would be of interest. 

Lastly the other night I had spent 20 minutes writing a long message regarding business with another user. I was on my last sentence when the app suddenly crashed. If you’re wondering, no, the app did not draft my messages and I had to type everything back out again. 

Overall, it does its job but be prepared for a lot of bugs. And the notifications Never work.",3
2023-06-21 13:02:48,Terrible Service,Linkin decided to block my account for unknown reasons. It’s been 2 weeks am I haven’t reciebed any answers. They wanted to verify my identity. I sent twice pictures of my identity and 2 weeks have gone by with no answer. I am still not able to access my account. What is going on. Again what was the reason to block it or denie access in the first place. It’s been more than 2 weeks now and for no good reason my account is still looked. I’m looking for job opportunities and clearly the corporate or software itself denies me the chance to do so. This is ridiculous. How can anyone try to expand or look for opportunities especially for military members trying to transition into civilian lifestyle. How am I suppose to do anything if this is the treatment Linkin is providing! And for no good reason my account was blocked! Why it doesn’t make any sense. It’s terrible service.,1

I recently started trying to use the job alert feature. I searched for a job (“software engineer”) at a mid-sized clothing retailer. I have seen open roles there before, and I know they employ software developers, but they don’t happen to have any open roles right now. I would like to create an alert for when such a role does open up,  but the “turn on alerts for this search” toggle only appears for searches that currently produce results. Please add the toggle to all job searches, no matter how specific, since this is the point of these alerts—to let users know if/when a relevant job pops up.

They have no quality assurance over job posts, so even if you set up an alert, it will give you a bunch of nonsense because job posters are allowed to mark jobs as more senior than they are and there is no way to apparently remove them. Contact their chat functionality which barely even works on the app so had to use the website and that was a whole performance, speaking to someone who just refused to answer questions and it would be better for them to use a bot at this point.

Is there a reason why this is happening? It’s really strange. At first, I thought it could be my imagination or the algorithm.

I normally don’t search for people due to the profile viewing feature, but I would like to know why and how certain people are finding my profile.

The lack of respect for user experience and monetization of spam is atypical for a Microsoft product. Unfortunately most of my friends and former colleagues have gone dormant. There are still some connections and creators whom I respect who do still post, but my experience even as a paid non-spamming user for years is steadily going down hill.",1
2021-08-31 01:42:22,Keeps trying to force me to update but won’t.,"I used to like this app and was a premium (paying) user with my iPod gen 6 (not the current one, but that immediately prior).  The new LinkedIn app will not run on the latest OS I can use (12.5.x), but the stupid app doesn’t comprehend that and keeps pestering me to update (at which point it fails, because I don’t have iOS 13+). Listen, we understand you don’t want to support the old app “forever “, but at the moment, the app itself works fine—it’s the neverend nag messages that are the problem. If you can’t tell someone is at that latest iOS they can get, let them manually disable the nags and keep using the app for as long as it works. Anyone, it became so annoying, I don’t use it nearly as much  as stopped paying the monthly premium charge.  Good work.",2
2020-01-29 01:04:17,A suggestion to the development team,"Dear Team,
The app has been developed nicely and is very user friendly. Everything’s great. There’s one feature that would really help out,
I am usually/mostly at work and have less time to watch videos, if there was a feature where I could save it to view later that would be amazing, I could just save the video/video link and go home and watch it instead of scrolling down and search for that post. Just like facebook app has the option to save the videos/video link to a certain ‘watch later’ folder. 
I really expect the team to work on it. 
Other than that, it’s good. Kudos to the developers!",5
2019-03-08 22:38:31,Good app but bad recent changes,"LinkedIn is a great professional app and I love how I can work on my career and look for opportunities using it! Haven’t had any weird glitches with it yet that downgraded my experience. 

I do have to deduct some points though for recent changes. The messages button was moved to the upper right and in its place on the bottom middle of the screen is the add a post button. This seems like a worse UI experience because I know I check and respond to messages far more than I post up a message and it’s kinda awkward to move the messages button up there. I also find that I can’t swipe to the right to go back to the last page I was on. Instead, I usually have to tap the back arrow in the upper left, which again, could be improved.",3
2023-04-08 21:23:52,Not very useful,"New to the platform but I have to say it is not very useful at all. I attempted to use the platform to search for local people looking for jobs similar to what I have to offer. After locating tons of accounts through the search bar, claiming they are looking for work, I realized that I can’t even visit their page, let alone open a line of communication to see if they would be interested in an interview. 

I understand that some would choose to keep their account private even while they are searching for jobs, but it wasn’t possible to view a single profile I came across through the search bar. I did find countless people looking for careers similar to what I am offering though. It’s like dangling food in front of a starving man. Am I supposed to pay the $60 per month to be able to “connect” with these people?",1
2020-06-22 18:48:24,Scammers,I was new to LinkedIn searching for new leads to jobs as I desperately need to find a new job after 27 years that gave my all. The hospital was bought out by Lahey Health and BI. Long story short I ended up being followed by what I know would turn out to be scams eventually asking for money I’m sure. I deleted one guy cause he made me feel uncomfortable. Then out of the blue 2 more people trying to chat with me. My final straw was when a third person tried to friend me or have conversation. But his profile picture was the person who first chatted with me. Different background picture but it was his face. Freaked me out so I don’t follow LinkedIn like I used to. I just recently had my identity stolen and I’m not going to entertain Catfish type people,4

How many people wish they were. facebook advertising ninja?  Well, linkedin is different, dynamic, and changing on a weekly basis.

I took a screen recording, and in a time span of 1 minute and 10 seconds, I was given four notifications that were just glitches. 
It’s also not user friendly at all. It freezes and crashes every time I attempt to look in the job section. 

Feels like an app that was just created by someone who doesn’t know what they’re doing, and like it needs a serious upgrade by an actual professional.",1
2023-09-12 01:34:19,Changes Need To Be Made,"This review is more about the website than the app but they are directly related. 

Only being able to add 50 skills is kinda dumb, there are those of us who have been working professionally for many years and over that time have learned and honed more skills than can be added. Adding just those too skills does a disservice to the individual, especially when applying for a new job. How are you supposed to get a proper match with the system if you’re only showing two particular skills because you weren’t able to add more due to only being able to list your top skills? 

Just my two cents but this can’t be the first time this question or request has come up.",3

I have been using indeed, LinkedIn and zip recruiter to find full time jobs while applying to them. Unfortunately the LinkedIn app is having some problems which make it frustrating to narrow down jobs. Your search job section only allows you to pick certain things while something disappears. I can put full time in location while selecting distance, salary and date posted. However it can let’s you select one or two of the options but not all three. I think it would be wise to fix the app to allow people to find what they are searching for and it could make the process smoother on people",2
2021-05-18 21:14:32,"Overall it is a great experience, however…","Great overall app and stays pretty true to its platform. There are 2 main things that bug me: 1) No dark mode and 2) messages don’t work properly. The messages is not great and you have to jump through hoops when you click on the notification for the message. You still have to go in the app and click on the messages icon and look for the message. Doesn’t have to be that complicated. Just give a notification click on the notification and let me go straight to the message. Also, should be able to respond to the messages from the Lock Screen.

Fix those 2 things and I will update my review and will add a star for each of those.",3
2023-10-20 14:01:37,There a scam,This app is a scam and they deleted my account for no reason. It was my way of staying connected with my co workers as well as people working in the field who ive met along the way. Building relationships to better career in the future was destroyed by this corrupt system. They are so horrible and now they are requesting my very sensitive and personal identification when they're system has been hacked recently and all personal information was leaked. Now they are requesting this information again as if i did something wrong when in fact it’s their scam system and fraudulent people working here who are attempting to steal your personal information and share data with whoever pays them on the side. These people are beyond scammers. Do not use LinkedIn they will do anything to obtain your personal information so they can sell it. Good riddance,1
2023-05-16 19:33:55,"Ok for networking, Not great for job searching","For networking LinkedIn seems fine. I don’t spend time scrolling personally so that part isn’t for me. I use LinkedIn for job searching and on its face LinkedIn seems good for that. Except since I started using it heavily for this purpose I’m inundated with scams. People emailing me for telegram interviews, phone calls from numbers don’t know, who don’t leave messages have ratcheted up. Fake LinkedIn profiles of people and companies pretending to be real people or companies to phish our personal info. It’s a HUGE problem and has been a large time waster for me. If this could be better managed by the company somehow it would be a much more useful platform and so 3 stars it is for now.",3
2018-05-11 23:24:06,Watch out for Premium Trial!!,"The mobile version lacks so many of the desktop version features such as privacy features and profile customization. However, what really bothers me is that LinkedIn uses this difference to their financial advantage so you cannot cancel a Premium subscription from your device even if they allow you to subscribe from your phone easily. You also get no notification when the Premium trial is ending so you get charged abruptly. If you miss the subscription cancellation date, LinkedIn will offer no refunds even if late by an hour!! Really?

Update:
The LinkedIn team reached out to me as shown below to offer support. Alas, it was all just lip service. When I reached out, they simply confirmed the limitations I had originally complained about without any real assistance offered.",2
2022-09-14 00:49:13,Really useful,"Honestly, I was finding myself super annoyed at the notifications lately. Every time I check the app, it seems like 5 minutes later I have a notification, and it’s just recommended content. Before writing a negative review I did check my settings and was happy to find it easy to tune my notifications so they are just for actual conversations and important updates. Thanks for making that easy. Otherwise no complaints, the app works well and I like certain features a lot (like quickly saving jobs on mobile so I can login on desktop later to review again and apply).",4
2020-07-22 15:21:39,Doesn’t show Jobs you’ve Applied for!,"Don’t plan on an easy time keeping track of the jobs you’ve applied for. I had applied for at least a dozen jobs. A couple days later I went to look for more jobs and check on the jobs I had already applied to. But under the “Jobs Applied” tab, there were ZERO jobs listed. Oh and I’m pretty sure I looked like an idiot when I accidentally applied for the same job twice since LinkedIn doesn’t tell you if you applied for the job yet or not.

I emailed customer service and they took a week to get back to me. Here is the response:
“Please note that only when you apply for Easy apply jobs. If you are applying Jobs on the external website, it will not show up in the applied Jobs section.

Aishwarya
Member Success Consultant”

DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND USE INDEED! That app/site keeps track of EVERY job you’ve applied to and if you happen upon the same job listing later on it TELLS YOU that you’ve already applied to that one. Indeed is so helpful and much better organized. And you don’t have to see the “newsfeed” from other people posting about their own job. I’m sorry, but why would I care if a guy from high school who never talked to me is posting about his career that has nothing to do with mine?!",1

2022-06-22 00:02:19,"Okay app, bad that you sell my data","LinkedIn says they care about your data, then proceed to sell your personal data. I have received dozens of phone calls in the past 2 months from online vendors all of them telling me the same thing. They PURCHASED my personal data from LinkedIn and use that to call me and others. 

LinkedIn is not protecting my data but actively selling it. 

Your terms and conditions clearly state that “IF SOMEONE ALREADY HAS YOUR NUMBER then they can find you.” Well now that you are selling my number how does this work? LinkedIn has betrayed my trust. 

Now I’m backed into a corner, what if I want to protect my data, I may want to use my phone number to reset a password. If I do that then I also concede that I knowingly allow LinkedIn to sell my data. Am I supposed to just allow this to happen? 

I’m posting here because for the past hour I could not find your customer service email channel. 

I’m curious if apple would see this as an invasion of privacy or just a cost of doing business. It bothers me greatly that you feel justified in selling my personal data and not sharing that you have done so. 

You should fix this.",2
2023-09-12 21:54:58,Notification Settings,"This app (like their website) makes changing notification settings really annoying. I am currently employed and don’t want any emails from LinkedIn, but don’t mind getting in app notifications. To set this, you have to go to each notification type (like 50) and switch off email and or push notifications. Now if I’m going to look for a new job, I’ll want to receive some emails and will have to make numerous adjustments again. Since LinkedIn has cornered the job seeking market, they get away with flooding everyone’s inbox with irrelevant marketing emails until you spend 10 minutes adjusting your settings (and possibly 5 more writing a 3 star review.)",3

Gotta keep people addicted and collect data point for people touching the app!!! 🤬 I TRIED.. I tried for 2 weeks to avoid turning off notifications, just tweaking settings each time I was annoyed, but I’ve lost it. Turning them off didn’t feel active enough for how mad I was, I wanted someone at the company to hopefully hear this. Felt so clickbait-ish rather than a professional website and really cheapened my interest in use LinkedIn at all, let all the app",2

Often times I get the never ending spinner, with an ultimate failure error message.

I was leery because I’ve experienced many many websites attempting to make life easier with a new app and they fall on their face. This particular app is probably one of the easiest to maneuver and it allows me to stay connected easily with notifications and simple maneuvering around the site. I choose to be a Premier member and the benefits are well worth the money. I love linked in. I’ve become friends worldwide not only for the industry I’m in but also personal friends with multitudes or different interests. Get the app.,5

The effort that it takes to write a post goes to waste as it crashes more than 90% of the time. I am using iPhone X, so hardware should not be an excuse for this issue. I would like to hear what the developers have to say about the problem. This problem has been an issue for at least last 2 years. I have installed the app multiple time but no luck. I don’t use the app anymore but sometime while traveling I have no other option. I am not sure why such a basic functionality is not resolved on this platform. Is it too hard for LinkedIn to figure this out?? 
Developers, can you provide me with an answer?

I assumed that the free trial would end because I never received a single email or notification about the upcoming subscription renewal after signing up for a free trial last month. I tried to find a place to cancel the subscription in the app and on the website with no luck. Now LinkedIn refuses to refund the payment. I am appalled. For a company that feigns interest in professional success, they have absolutely no sense of what providing good customer service entails. Auto renewing an expensive subscription without notice and without asking for permission is sneaky and conniving. Then refusing to refund the payment is insane. I am severely disappointed in LinkedIn and will be sure to warn my employees, colleagues, and friends.",1

Every time I leave the app to text, check a calendar, read an email, I return to LinkedIn and it resets to the top of the feed instead of resuming where I’ve left off. So I’m left with scrolling all the way back to where I was or forgetting it and switching to something else entirely because it’s frustrating, and it’s usually the latter. IG and FB can handle remembering where I was when I switch so I know you can do this. I’m not even closing the app entirely. It’s still open in the background. This change would increase my engagement with this tool. Please help.",4

When I came back, it had a popup pushing me to update.  It wouldn’t let me ignore it.  So I let it take me to app store.  But I can’t get the update because I still have an older iOS.  It refused to install an older version that would be compatible with my ios.
So now I’m stuck.  I can’t update it right now, and I can’t keep using it as-is, because the little popup forcing me to update won’t go away or let me do anything in the app.
Frustrating when I know it worked great this morning without being updated 😤.  And the app store says the last update was 3 days ago, so I know it didn’t just update today without asking me.",1

Also, I get way too many notifications and my attempts to dial them back haven’t been 100% successful. I even had to turn off the badge count in the settings app. Although there’s a weird bug that still displays the badge number at the folder level (if the app is in a folder), even after deleting and reinstalling the app. Restarting my iPad fixed it temporarily.",3

The app consistently will say “could not refresh page,” No matter the connectivity to 5G or tested, known-good wifi. 

I am grateful for the access it provides and will acknowledge there’s no better professional social media for job hunters, but as the best software it should have the best engineers working to resolve these bugs, and there should be an easier way to report issues up the engineering pipeline as a longterm user.",1

2023-02-21 19:32:23,Good reviews why?,I don’t under the appeal of this app. I have a recruiter friend that kept recommending it to me. Not once in all the years I’ve used it has any job offer ever come through. Even with her help updating my resume. Also the search job function is useless. For example I can type “executive assistant” “remote” and it will bring up jobs not even relating to what I asked for. It takes part of one of two words and tries to match it I guess?? Why when I type executive assistant it shows me a sales manager position? It also doesn’t save my settings. I want to see the most recent jobs but it keeps defaulting to “most relevant”. I shouldn’t have to keep changing my settings. Just have never had a good experience with this app. Very frustrating to use with no leads ever. Don’t recommend,1

It has in fact gotten me my last two positions, but when I open the app late at night to see my connections posts for the day, my eyes are singed and I don’t have the desire to use the app as it’s white background is an aesthetic very displeasing. Those who don’t use dark mode think it’s no big deal, but some people have sensitive eyes and dark mode users know the importance and appreciate how good an app looks on the dark side. Overall it is a great app and service, just have your team make it dark mode, we will all appreciate it",4

Try to write an article on the app...crash! Try to apply to a job...almost always crashes! Try to download or save something from the app....I can guarantee it will crash!

Is it necessary for me to take this free data AI collection test for Microsoft/LinkedIn over and over again every time I get my password wrong. Is there a reason why this is the only app that won’t accept my facial recognition, while every other app does, when moving from Mac to my iPhone to log in???

Other than that, I absolutely love LinkedIn.  It’s an easy, fun way to connect to the business world and to network and build relationships across different markets and industries.

Once I merged the accounts, that all disappeared!!! I was left with the account attached to my work email and no profile. I’ve been looking on the website to see if I can get this corrected, but as in most cases there isn’t a was to get “LinkedIn” to a real person!!!

I’m even a premium member but that doesn’t seem to make any difference, it’s just so frustrating. I’m starting to use other means like Glassdoor more and more...

2017-09-23 16:45:39,Please Fix,I am trying to connect to a lot of fitness professionals and it takes 10+ minutes for the requests to send after I clicked on it.  Then if I switch screens it stops sending them.  So I have to resend requests over and over.   It also covers up the search bar so I can’t do anything else.  Then when clicking the little circles to add someone it always will jump to their page because my fingers are too fat maybe making it less sensitive around the circle or making it a bigger button would be better.  It just is a nuisance and I can’t get back because the back button is covered up by the requests being sent pop up. Fix those problems and I’d say 5 star.,3
2020-09-26 06:50:44,Just another Facebook or Instagram now,"Just opened Facebook, I mean Instagram, oh no I mean LinkedIn. The latest update has remodeled the user interface to make it appear more like Facebook or Instagram. I have always loved the professionalism of LinkedIn and the feature that made it less like a social network. I’m not here for peoples live videos but more for professional opinions, relationships, and experiences.

I am a multiple-times-a-day user, frequently browsing my industry network and making new and valuable connections. That won’t be as easy anymore with the latest move by LinkedIn to conform to the likes of Facebook and LinkedIn. 

Would love to learn more about the intelligence and user surveys that led to this latest change because they were obviously flawed.",2
2021-02-26 04:01:10,Login/Authentication issue,"As mentioned by many other users, the app keeps asking me to re-login every time I closed the app. Something worse happened a few months ago. Although I can still use the app, it creates so much in convenience. And I can’t believe this fundamental issue is not being fixed for many days and is repeating not far from the last incident.
Plus, I have problems using the app, too. Sometimes the connection is just broken when I’m trying to refresh, click a page, like a post, etc., the page return error(page not found or something similar). Ugh.
I love the LinkedIn platform, but the app really needs to be more solid. 
Please test your product before each release and take feedback seriously and avoid similar issue happen in the future. Thanks!",1
2022-10-08 07:19:32,Replacing the My Network tab?,"What an awful update this is.  The new discover tab is a rehash of the home tab.  I have absolutely no use for it.  My most visited tab was “my network” and now it’s an absolute pain to get to and poor user experience.  I am sure some clever product manager thinks this is some great new innovation that the users didn’t know we needed. But it’s not. It’s just making the experience worse.  Even when using the resource section link to my network, it’s still a bad look and feel compared to the old layout.  You have enough bugs to keep your team busy. How about you focus on not constantly refreshing back to the home page when you click off the app?  This update is a failure.  Stop making changes for change’s sake.",1
2023-02-05 04:10:04,No flag to indicate “Not Looking “!,"I have been retired for about 1.5 years, and like to stay on LinkedIn to see what is going on with people I used to work with. My heading is written as “Retired”, but I keep getting contacted by head hunters! I am not interested in going back to work and it would be nice if LinkedIn had flag to indicate “Not Looking” or something to that effect! I am flattered that some people see my skills as a possible asset, but feel that if they could see right away that I prefer not work, they would not waste their time and get their hopes up. I am quite certain that I am not the only person on LinkedIn that would use such a flag. Thanks",3
2021-06-20 04:47:56,Forced indoctrination,"Linkedin forces all users to participate in policies supported by their company that users do not agree with and that have nothing to do with professional health nor professional interest or connections or network for which all users come onto linked in for. They also mark all complaints as resolved and closed by force that has been brought to their support attention when it ""has not"" been resolved to the users satisfaction snd they have been made aware of it, they ignore this fact. This is not an ideal platform to use because of this. Seek other professional platforms that allow users to opt out of anything they disagree with and to participate in anything they agree with without Linkedin forcing their indoctrination policies on users.",1
2020-09-01 14:49:58,A great app/website for shameless self-promoters,I started my account 6 years ago in hopes it would help me land a new job. I found a new job but no thanks to LinkedIn (another web based job site helped with that). The content consists mostly of posts from people shamelessly promoting themselves or from people trying to spin their videos of children or animals into some kind of life altering message. Now the geniuses (at LinkedIn) are taking it upon themselves to change my chosen location on my profile unless I tell them not to.  That’s seriously messed up. How about suggesting I change it?  What’s really disturbing is that my phone does not show any location services that can be switched off on the app. Honestly thinking about deleting.,2
2019-12-18 19:00:54,Cannot message potentials connects before accepting,"The evil money-grabbers at LinkedIn have removed the ability to message for free somebody who has requested to join your network. For privacy and security it is necessary that we be able to message these people to make sure they are who they say they are or if we don’t recognize them, to ask them where we know them from. As a free user I am now forced to accept the connection before sending the message, exposing my personal info to a potential stranger. The goblins as LinkedIn need to value our privacy and security over our money by reenabling the reply (don’t accept yet) option on connection requests. If you agree, please also give a one star review (you can even copy and paste mine) so we can inform LinkedIn that they cannot get away with this.",1
2018-10-15 12:52:07,Stop with the excessive notifications,"Update: I can’t send the screenshots to you with the glitch through this app. I’ve emailed you through the actual desktop site with this problem, asking for an email address to show you this issue. Nothing has changed and no one has contacted me. App will be deleted. 

I turned off all notifications because I was getting too many. I was tired of it. Now, I get a notification that I have no notifications set up. That’s. The. Point. Stop with this ridiculous amount of notifications. Fix it, otherwise, I’m deleting the app altogether.

Update again: Since I just got another response from LinkedIn about this problem, here’s the update: I can’t send you a screenshot, see point above. The app has been deleted off my phone for months now.",1
2017-10-03 18:51:11,Completely irresponsible with push notifications,"I've turned off notifications for everything except the few things I care about (invitations to connect, messages, anything else that pertains directly to me). I still receive push notifications for superfluous events like ""trending news articles"" on a daily basis. The app is designed to have as many notification types as possible, and I've turned off more obscure notifications than I can remember. If you turn one off, the notification settings linked from the dismissed message only shows you what you've turned off, with no option to turn off all the other notifications you'll eventually receive. Completely irresponsible and annoying. I'll be reserving LinkedIn for the desktop from now on.",1
2017-11-20 03:46:12,Quit messing with the app!,"And STOP asking me to link my contacts—never going to happen in a million years!

I give up... What happened to the swipe feature to ignore/delete people whom I don’t want to send an invite to?? 

UPDATE: The response from LinkedIn makes absolutely no sense! I’m not asking for some new “improvement”—I want them to return to the logical functionality the app used to have. Do they honestly expect people to keep scrolling through this exhaustive list of names of others they don’t want to connect with, without a deletion method???

UPDATE 2: The latest response from LinkedIn still makes no sense! Again, this is not some kind of “new improvement” I’m requesting. It’s the way the app USED to work and NOW the functionality is GONE. PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!!!

UPDATE 3: Thank you for bringing back the feature of being able to “x” the people I don’t want to connect with. But, the new huge box layout is awful because you see less people on the screen at once and can’t read as much about them without clicking on their profile. Just put it back to the way it used to be please!!",2
2023-01-30 14:36:57,Important post vanished and no support,"I’m so frustrated with linkedin. I’ve been on that platform for what feels like forever and as of recently they have totally ignored my support messages. One of the most important posts of my career simply vanished due to their internal technical error (drafts are connected to published posts, so if you have a second window open with a draft of the post you published, and you delete the draft days or weeks later, your published post will vanish too!!!). No help whatsoever, they simply say they will forward the case to the technical team or research team but nothing ever happens and they simply close the case. It’s become the worst platform, this is just one example of how they leave you hanging, and do not offer support whatsoever.",1
2021-06-12 04:58:11,Didn’t even get to sign in,"I’m a thirteen year old going into highschool in only a couple of months. I plan on graduating early, so I’ve been trying to figure out what career to pursue. I was told that LinkedIn was a good app to research about careers. So I thought why not? When creating an account, I added my date of birth as “2007” and I was booted out saying that I did not meet the age requirements although their age requirements are stated as 12+. I thought, maybe I typed in the wrong date of birth? So I tried to create an account again. It told me “your phone number is already in use.” So I went to log in; there was no account created using my number. Anyways, I tried again. This time with my email. I didn’t even get passed my name. It kept saying “registration in process.”",1
2021-03-23 14:10:16,Horrible app,"Half the time I get told there is no internet connection found, yet switching to mobile version I get no such error (nor have any issue getting to any other app or thing online)  Nice try to blame app issues on a network. There are so many problems with the app + search / most recent / job alert search result issues that it’s not even worth the download. Problem is most of these issues exist on the mobile (browser) version as well so using anything other than the desktop version is a lackluster experience. 

Not impressed given the maturity of the company. Seems like user experience and QA testing before releases isn’t really their thing anymore. This is what happens when chasing the Benjamins is the focus even though it’s the users/consumers who made the company.",1
2023-04-23 23:40:35,Some complains,"In general it’s ok. Two things I don’t like:

The same ad show up on my feed everyday. I finally want to turn it off. I cannot find an easy way to turn it off. I’m still going to see it everyday. I’m going to be so sick of it and stop using LinkedIn.

When you are pushed with a job opportunity, sometimes your connections will show up below the job brief description line. I would assume those head icons are super links to those users’ pages. But they are not. You hit on them, you still connect to the job page instead.",4
2019-10-30 20:05:01,Could be better,"First and most importantly, there should be a rate/review a company option! This would allow current, past & possible new candidates transparent reviews about every company! A competitor, Glassdoor has this feature! Past associates would be able to shine light on issues they encountered while working there as well. Secondly, what’s with the constant LinkedIn members flooding message inbox to get one to go premium? I would like a notification feature where I can more easily tell when I have new messages that way I can keep track and respond in a more timely fashion! Many messages from employers are lost in the shuffle of my LinkedIn messages overall.",3
2019-05-04 00:10:36,Beware of the “free” premium auto renewal..,"Before I start.. this is more a review for Apple/iTunes subscription practices than LinkedIn.. so everywhere you see LinkedIn, you can basically fill-in any auto renewal subscription app.. WATCH OUT!! If you’re interested in trying out the free Premium version, you better be paying attention because if you’re not, you're going to slapped with the $65 monthly subscription charge before you even figure out what the difference is between Premium and the free version! I can think of a TON of other things I’d rather spend $65 on! And if you do get charged, GOOD LUCK getting Apple/iTunes to issue you a refund... I think they literally flip a coin. You’re likely stuck with another 30 days. Maybe you can use the extra 30 days figure out the difference..SOUR APPLE!",1
2022-11-02 02:05:38,Terrible app for a great platform,"The mobile app is total garbage. That’s how much money has been put into LinkedIn you would think a little bit would be spent on making the app work better. I don’t understand why it needs to refresh the whole app when I go to another page or another app causing me to lose comments or messages. The app crashes frequently when I’m using it and I have the newest iPhone and the latest update. The messages are a complete nightmare to try to use and respond to people. Everything seems to take much longer to load than it should and there are so many issues I don’t even know where to start. 

Please focus on making this app work better. The number of bugs are ridiculous.",1
2022-08-29 14:57:17,So glitchy,"Messages that have been archived still show up on the mobile app. On my desktop it’s ok but the mobile is so freaking glitchy. I can’t get the messages not show up in my inbox even though they have been archived. I don’t get notifications when someone posts a comment. It’s only when I go to the post that I can see who commented or liked it. Comments on posts don’t load. It says “see more replies/comments” but then nothing expands and it still shows that there are replies. When writing a post the cursor keeps jumping to the bottom of the page. That’s a new glitch. Hate the mobile app. And using mobile web browser is worse. LinkedIn, get yourself together!",2
2020-06-02 23:42:28,LinkedIn and Microsoft are not interested in your feedback,"I spent 20 minutes looking for a way to provide app feedback on the app and on the website to no avail. Regardless, this is the actual feedback - I have been missing messages since I turned off badges. When I turned badges on to address this, I was inundated with LinkedIn's notification happy feed. I would like to see these things when I log in, but not interested in them being included in the badge alert count. My only option was to turn off badges and revert to email notifications for new messages. It seems like a missed opportunity, and even more so if they make it impossible for those interested in improving the platform to provide feedback.",2
2021-05-14 17:00:49,"Love the platform, app notifications are a problem","As a social networking site, LinkedIn is amazing. The iPhone app is pretty intuitive as well, which is great. Unfortunately, with the latest release, they added notifications about online events to the My Network page, and there is no way to disable these notifications. In the past, notifications on the My Network page were for connection requests, which made good logical sense. The only way to avoid constantly having a notification displayed on the app badge is to completely disable badge icons, which means you may miss important things.",3
2020-04-24 14:18:17,LinkedIn is a very dangerous product,"LInkedIn is a dangerous product. Users beware. I recently discovered that without any authorization from me or from anyone with access to my Apple devices, they have been charging me almost $100 per month for something called Premium Business. I was able to submit a request for refund but for only the past two months via Apple support. But Apple advise that only two months can be refunded even though LInkedIn apparently began charging me monthly in December 2019. The LinkedIn website gives no means for canceling or requesting refund for charges that are apparently fraudulent - due to some LinkedIn mistake.

Apparently the Premium Business account is for corporations, not for retired individuals with very limited income and no need for any LinkedIn Premium Services.",1
2023-08-02 18:21:40,Fix the web page,"Normally, the web page does all I need the few times that I use it. Yesterday, I tried updating my profile, but many of the changes didn’t seem to stick. I tried searching help, but the help links prompt iOS Safari to download the web page rather than show it. Searching the web indicates LinkedIn has shut down all means of contacting them, so I guess 1-star review is where it’s at.

I downloaded the app to update the profile, which worked. But then it asked me permission to send me notifications. Clicking “don’t allow” did nothing and couldn’t dismiss the prompt. I quit the LinkedIn app and it didn’t go away. I tried “allow” and it didn’t go away. I couldn’t use the iPad at all, so I had to reboot it.",1
2019-04-09 13:36:17,Poor customer service,"So this is the third review I am writing, my first two were taken down.  

Again my issue is a simple one. 

1. Make the “X” to click off a potential contact a bit larger so I am not opening one instead of deleting it. 

2. If I delete someone don’t put them back in the suggested contacts over and over and over and over. They should not ever appear again. 

Two simple fixes to two problems with linked in. 

Additional problem that was not in my first two reviews: 

3. Don’t delete my review because you don’t like it.

3/9/19 Update:
Keeps getting worse. Nothing has been fixed and the little “x” seems harder to click. I don’t want to click on the “x” just to have it open someone’s profile. It is a false click. I am sure that is why I get so many “people are looking at your profile” notifications each week, the tiny “x”

I will add another problem:
4. Half the time now I cannot open a profile I actually want to see. The program freezes and I need to close and reopen the app, then I need to TRY to find that persons again. 

Please, I implore you, please fix these small, but glaring, problems",1
2019-04-03 13:26:18,Mobile is inferior to desktop version,"I find LinkenIn a valuable way to connect professionally. I like the convenience of being able to access my account on my laptop or through the app. The mobile app has issues though, primarily that the news feed can not be displayed chronologically with “most recent” instead of the algorithm-determined “top stories”. The value of this network is seeing what people are doing now and what events are coming up. Eliminating the ability to view the feed by recent posts makes the mobile app useless for me. 

Please change the app to display the feed is chronological order. This is not Facebook.",3
2018-08-18 14:36:20,Only One Problem,"I gave LinkedIn’s latest mobile app 5 Stars because “in general” I believe it deserves it. 
However, although it might be only happening on my iPhone 6sPlus, I have the following bug: When I first open the app, (Main Screen), the animated icon that used to appear at the top of the screen informing that there are New Posts is gone. If it’s not just my phone then it should be an easy fix. When it’s back then the 5 Stars will be fully deserved. Other than that, after 10 years, LinkedIn remains my Primary Social Media site.",5
2017-10-30 03:48:59,Hate the new suggestion function,"I got lots of people connect to me. I used to be able to accept most of hem quickly and now it kept pop up suggestions. Is annoying and interpreting the task I was trying to complete. Hate it. Please remove it! 

Also, you should have a function to allow people to make note to the connection and also auto record when I connect. eg I go to conference today so everyone I added today is from the conference. The pain point is that you don't remember where and how you met the person. Or when you go to conference, you add tons of people, when you are home and trying to recall who you met today, you open your LinkedIn, there is no easy way to find them anymore!",2
2022-10-21 17:22:54,LinkedIn Refreshes After Looking at other Apps,"LinkedIn is a fantastic tool for connecting with colleagues and networking across my field. However, the iPhone and iPad application is terrible. 

My #1 complaint is that the app refreshes just about every time I leave and look at another app on my device. Open the app and look to message a contact, switch to email to copy something to send to them, and when I go back to the app it’s completely refreshed and lost where I had been. It’s extremely frustrating.

#2, the app should give you the option to send a note with a connection request just like the website does. It’s annoying when it just shoots off an invite without giving the opportunity to enter a note.",1

And I also love it for connecting with people within my field as well as applying for jobs that sometimes are only on LinkedIn. So for the most part the app is amazing. But as I said in the title, the app NEEDS DARK MODE. My eyes can’t handle it anymore and I really hoping the Devs would have put it in by now since most if not all other apps have an option to switch on dark mode. This app needs that ASAP.",5
2020-06-12 16:19:58,Timelines,"Overall, I don’t mind this app, but I think the timelines really prevent me from enjoying LinkedIn more. I swear I’ve changed my timeline before to sort by new?? I’m looking for that option now though and can’t find it. Basically, I open up this app, and I feel like I see the same posts every single time. And I see that my timeline is showing me things from 1-2 weeks ago that I’m seeing for the umpteenth time. I really only want to see these things once. It feels like I never get an influx of new content, it’s always the same stuff. Sometimes there’s a newer post mixed in, but the overall sense I’m getting is that I’m not ever seeing anything new. It’s so annoying.",3
2018-10-08 19:34:34,LinkedIn Customer Support Not Good,"I’m a long-time LinkedIn user and evangelist but costumer support seems to be slipping. You can download your connections and get all the information you need to plan regional meetings except City and State. If you check profiles to get that information and add it to the downloaded spreadsheet, they restrict your account for the “security of your connections.” I can download their names, employer names, employment history, education history, etc., so I’m not sure how city and state contributes to security risk. Customer service rep didn’t seem to know city and state aren’t in the download, didn’t seem to care, and didn’t have the forethought to give that suggestion to the product development team. Kinda lame for a business app.",2

LinkedIn checks all the boxes for me except that it’s starting to get glitchy at times. I lose connections one minute and they reappear the next hour or so on my contact list. I’ve deleted the app a few times and reinstalled it; it has helped solved the problem momentarily. If LinkedIn is able to fix the issue with the connection count and glitches, it will certainly deserve a 5/5",3
2022-10-09 23:08:15,"Annoying to Swipe Away From, Repetitive","Robust app pretty much, but incredibly annoying to swipe away from, because the app repeatedly refreshes every single time you swipe away to another app, as if you had closed it. 

There’s no other app with a feed that does this, especially given its similarity to most social apps in terms of recommended posts, but it continues to annoy me because of the fact that if I receive a message and swipe away to respond, I’ll return to the app without being able to pick up where I left off and see what I was reading or what I had just scrolled by. 

Also pretty annoying how the algorithm really only displays a few (5-10) organizations’/people’s posts from the hundreds (200+) I follow.",1
2019-05-28 23:36:56,Free LinkedIn is ok - paid LinkedIn is questionable,"Microsoft’s purchase of Linked-In appears to show typical post-buyout behavior. As an example, the app interface is aging, slow, and uninspiring. “Posts” are becoming advertising in disguise and no-content click bait posts are now the majority of the content.  For MSFTs us$26.2 Billion purchase, you might expect more. 
Hopefully, a competitive site will gain popularity soon. I can’t see value with “premium” membership if you aren’t a in sales or a recruiter except, ironically, if you really hate your job or really extroverted and unemployed. In the “column” the basic feature of connecting to others is ok for now (but Twitter is getting better for most things). Free LinkedIn is ok - paid LinkedIn is questionable",2

2017-10-28 17:51:21,New update is crashing hard,"Hello,
I actually really like this app but the latest update has completely crashed the platform.
My profile and feed will not load at all. If I didn’t know better, I’d think that the latest update has erased my profile entirely. But having visited the desktop platform, I can tell that all of my info is safe.

UPDATE 1:50pm :
I can now login. And congrats on adding a much needed native video feature. But now the issues is that posts aren’t functioning as intended.
It appears that you attempted to add a carousel feature for multiple image posts (which is great) but it doesn’t work. Only one image is visible once posted AND baldly cropped into a forced horizontal dimension. Then if I tap into enlarging the photo. It still only shows 1 photo and not the 3 that I posted.
Another issue, is that I tried to revert to posting just a single photo but for some reason, that single photo fails to appear; only the post copy shows in the feed.

Please fix the app.
Almost there

Update post developer response: it seems they are working on the issues and I will update my review once they’re fixed! I do love this app otherwise and it’s helped me significantly.

Also, when I’m pulling up a job that I want to apply to in the app, the first part of the role description is cut off. This only happens on my iPad, not my phone. Still frustrating as I have to look up each job on my phone then apply on my iPad.

I got a text telling me to call specifically from a “career advisor” and when she asked me three times if I would consider going to college and I kept saying I would not, she hung up... I am applying for full time work, not college. It’s to the point that I want to change my number. I terminated my account and I’m so glad I did.

For example, I may set a filter to hybrid and then decide to deselect hybrid and select remote, but the filter has both checked. So I reset the filters and try again, but it still keeps both options selected. Another example is a filter being deselected when I apply another filter. For instance, I apply the filter for Experience Level and then apply a filter for On-site/remote, but the Experience Level filter is then deselected. The job search experience on LinkedIn is miserable.",1

You post all your info and photos to this site expecting to get somewhere within your career field and it’s just a site people put their info on and never look back at it again. 

What needs to be looked into is how often are people logging into the site? If its months and years in between logins then this site is useless. 

I’ve tried to use the app with an open mind, but it simply doesn’t work.

Issues I experienced today 2019 is searching for jobs it will show you the jobs, but click on them and try to get more information and I always get opps, not you, something went wrong. 

Looks like it’s time to consolidate my online profiles and delete the profiles that I no longer have a use for. With linkedin being at the top of that list. Linkedin has turned into a kids safe zone style facebook. Where people post memes and all you can do is like or comment. They seem to be more focused on that stuff and not the job seeker side.",1

I might have used the app once a day to check the feed and maybe find useful work related news to read about. But the constant contact gathering windows, the “give me your contacts from your phone”, the “give me your email credentials” B*S* has left me no option but to uninstall the app.

Now I will maybe go to the website once or twice a month.  LINKEDIN, your contact gathering initiative has backfired terribly on you.  

You cannot use this app to do what you want to do (read news, find jobs, find people you know, etc) because LINKEDIN constantly tries to steer you into doing something else that is to add value to their business.

I specialized in vacuum tube technology! A niche market for high-end audiophiles down to musicians who still use vacuum tube guitar amplifiers.

Extremely unfair and it takes weeks to verify your identity. It’s mind boggling that a big corporation like this can’t hire a customer support team. Looks like Linkedin doesn’t care at all for the users. And then they constantly shove their premium service in your face. For the cost of the service, they should hire some customer support.

I can assure you, stating ones pronouns in Asia is not welcome and will definitely cause others in my network to assume I’m homosexual or otherwise some kind of ideological crusader… and a bit of a nut.

The page received a large number of solicitations from “advisors” in a short time, which was followed by a LinkedIn notice to me to not use mass marketing software.  I was surprised since I mostly respond to notifications and not initiate them.

At this point I can see that notifications have come in but cannot retrieve them. My profile is gone and I cannot respond to inquiries of positions available or invitations to add to my list or respond to messages or invitations from LinkedIn. 

My LinkedIn page is now split between two different emails. When I try to log in the LinkedIn “bot” warns me that there are 99+ people on LinkedIn with my unique name.

Please…I feel LinkedIn is a fabulous is a fantastic resource. I need some help in figuring out how bring the world of LinkedIn and my contacts back together.

The keyboard/text input freezes, and the messaging screen is stuck loading.

Well, as much as I love the LinkedIn product (seriously, I'm happy with the amount of contacts I've received from recruiters lately for my specialty), this app is a privacy-disregarding piece of garbage, and may need to be reported to either Apple or, even worse, some sort of government agency.",1

Love the way that it invites you to fill out your profile since it engages you with a meter that fills every time that you do something. But the thing that keeps it from 5 stars is that when it asks you to submit a profile picture, or work experience, or almost anything else you have to try multiple times by starting over, entering the same information again, and hope that it accepts your information. Pressing the “add to profile” or “save” feature virtually does nothing. Very frustrating, but everything else is pretty flawless.",3

And yes, I found where they moved it, but it only shows the same sections of companies and ""influencers"" to follow, not any actual people I might want to connect with and grow my network. Why would you bury this if the purpose of this app is ostensibly to grow your network?

I have two phone numbers and just switch from primary to secondary to keep my data useage down on my Verizon line.

Knowing who is looking at your profile can help determine if the company that is looking at your page is something you are actually qualified for, or help you decide if you need to tweak something or pay money to someone who can help with your resume. Why do I have to pay to see who is viewing my profile???? It’s a more of a professional social media page where people post their personal (not professional) opinions on articles.",1
2018-03-08 14:54:56,Little things kill the experience,"The app itself works fine; it’s several other things that bother me enough to give it 2 stars.

Auto-playing video
I’ve never been a fan, and specifically make a point to quickly skip over anything that auto-plays. My time is worth more than being distracted by some video that I didn’t want to see in the first place.

Pop-up banner ads
The most recent update apparently has banner ads that pop up at the bottom of the screen blocking portions of the news feed. I’m fine with in-line ads, but pop-ups are just annoying.

Private message ads
When I see a notification in my messages, I no longer know if it’s someone legitimately trying to contact me, or if it’s a paid ad that I have to specifically go out of my way to ignore. Again, my time is worth more to me than that.

Maybe they’re just trying some of these out, and are open to user feedback. But if this stays around for too long, I think I’ll delete the app, and substantially lower my use of LinkedIn.",2

I’ve accidentally sent a few requests to people on LinkedIn who are apparently “in my network” & suggested I should connect but have no idea who they are (never met). I don’t want to connect to them. However, I hit the “request connect” when I was trying to do something else. It happens when I’m using LinkedIn on my iPhone. Would it be possible to have an “unsend” request button?

I selected all the right pictures but still told me I selected the wrong ones and had to start over. I can’t even contact Linkedin to notify them because they don’t make it easy to find their contact information. Everything redirects you to help pages which is a terrible customer experience.

Now it “expands up” and I have to scroll back up to get the the beginning of the post to read all the text. I’m seeing this both in my phone and iPad running the latest versions of iOS and the app. It’s beyond frustrating and no other app behaves this way and I’m about to ditch the app and only use the web version.",2

There’s times when I need to message someone I don’t know, and that is another form of networking but apparently LinkedIn doesn’t think so. LinkedIn is very personalized to the point they analyze your private life. And if you want to talk to someone, you need the premium version.",2

- posts about new scientific discoveries in my field
- and few other professional content

But then when you select “choose” in the app, it immediately sends you to the “crop photo” screen and distorts the color making the profile picture look terrible. You’d think LinkedIn’s photo editing options would help, but no - the colors remain unacceptable, even adjusting with the filters. Why not just allow the photo to remain in the same color as it was uploaded? This forces users to accept unprofessional looking photos when they are trying to update their profile photo.",1

I have to maintain my organization’s page as well, so I am unfortunately on the site often enough to keep my inbox clear, and yet the app and the site are always bombarding me with notifications and flags about activity that is not even real.

It’s counterproductive & I’ll probably delete the app if simple functionality cannot be restored. 

Also would help if you could manage company pages from the app. Seeing as this is a business based platform it would make sense to be able to do that on the app rather than wrestle with the abysmal way it’s laid out on the mobile browser.

As a research tool, this app is worthless. Anytime I am reading something and need to leave the app and access notes, or a search engine, for example, when I come back to the LI app, it automatically refreshes, and I lose the article I was reading. No amount of searching has ever let me find it again. If I forget to save the article, it is lost and the project I was framing/working on is also lost. 

Recommendations:
-Don’t automatically refresh the page when you leave the app open in the background. Refresh manually (drag and hold down) or refresh when you open the app new. 
-Provide a reading history to go back to where you left off.

The “Your invitation to ____ is on it’s way” is incredibly slow and intrusive. It also covers the top of the screen which means you can’t close a profile, close a photo, use the search, etc. You have to wait for the notification to go away. Very poorly designed.

Like most people these days, I use mobile devices such as my phone and tablet much more than I do an actual computer. I have very sensitive eyes. I’ve looked everywhere for a dark mode, which apparently does not exist on the iOS app. I attempted to utilize the Help section in the app, but could not get the live chat to connect. I continuously encountered an error saying a connection to the server could not be made. For a company that brought in $6.8 billion in revenue last year, is it too much to ask for an update to allow a dark mode option?",1

2021-02-07 07:27:10,LinkedIn has mediocre support,I recently opened a support case with LinkedIn as I found a defect within the App. If you try to remove a connection and then re-launch the App the connection re-appears. No errors are given. However this isn’t an issue via a regular internet browser. Support keeps asking me for the connection to repro however I already deleted this person via the UI. What does support do? Close my case yet I found a legitimate bug. The level of customer satisfaction I was given was extremely lacking. I really hope I can fill out a survey to provide feedback from a consumer perspective. My message to LinkedIn go above and beyond for your customers. Try just a little bit. Have accountability!,1

The app crashes at unfortunate moments. It has crashed several times as I’ve been writing posts (and it has lost them). It has crashed as I’ve been filling in applications for positions. It did that on me today. Now I have no idea which vacancy I was applying to.

The chat room (news discussion, postings discussions) are way too much of a zoo. In fact, so much of a zoo, I wonder whether people on are really professionals or children. 

Looking at the lists of names I see many fake names, names of cartoon characters etc being used. Since that’s acceptable, I’d rather like a feature that allows me to change my name when I get bored with it. Maybe one day I might be Ermintrude another day, Dylan or Brian or perhaps Zebedee. Maybe even Florence.",3

You can’t buy additional services in Premium if you bought via Apple. The app is limited. They will make you cancel and re-subscribe via LinkedIn and the two companies do not talk.

This is all wasted space that could be used for zooming in to make text and posts larger and more readable. A prior version of this app allowed zooming in on the content for readability.  Really dislike the direction this app has been taking. Makes me conclude that Microsoft (LI’s owner) doesn’t care about accessibility one bit.  Devs, please reincorporate pinch-to-zoom ASAP, as not everyone has perfect eyesight — we need to be able to make the posts larger for readability.

To add another you must retype your entire search term—every time!  This is infuriating because it doesn’t even save your previous term. Adding insult to injury, you CAN tick off terms from their initial list of suggestions based on your work history, but not for your own searches.

So I lost my account which I used for 10 years because my legal name doesn’t  match my legal name.

For example, their Master’s or Ph.D will be at the bottom and while their bachelor is on top.

I wrote LinkedIn via snail mail to explain and provided backup on how I know the latest 15 people invited and requested that the warning be rescinded So far no known response.

My letter was copied to Apple to disallow aps to eviscerate such useful functions.

The Apple store person I consulted with in person offered no easy answer to rollback to previous version.

With LinkedIn now willing to serve the interest of China over you and me its users, I’d give them negative stars with a negative rating if possible.

Linkedin app starts fine but as soon as I scroll 2 or 3 pages down, it immediately hangs and never responds back.  This is not some small bug,  it completely makes app unusable.

This kind of basic issue is reflective of Linkedin QA and dev quality or probably because as someone said, with ad based Free service you are not consumer who comes first for company, but you are the product.  This is probably why app was released to general public with such basic issue.  it is not simply your post disappearing or not showing up which I have seen in past which I accepted as part of free service deal, but app simply hanging is not acceptable even for free service.",1

2018-09-05 19:09:37,"Buggy, slow, random losses of state and drafts",The performance of the app leaves a lot to be desired. I think this might have to do with the fact that the app isn’t truly native to iOS. Instead it’s just framework port of the actual website. The worst aspect of the app is that it randomly dumps the state of the app that you’re working on when LinkedIn forces the “news feed” to update. You end up losing the article that you were reading or the comment that you were drafting. It’s incredibly frustrating and it would be much better if the app were written from the ground up by actual iOS developers.,2
2018-06-08 10:34:27,Seriously.... Still no improvements,"2018 I re-downloaded the app to see if it had improved since my awful, unusable experience years ago. It's even worse. I couldn't even access my profile to make changes. Ridiculous. Re-deleted.

2010 review The only reason I use linkedin is due to my groups membership and I only downloaded this because I thought I could keep up with updates to these groups on my iPhone..... No luck.... Please.... What are you waiting for? I can't update my profile either, as too busy in work to work on it so thought this app could help me stay updated while on way to or from work... Again... No luck... Am deleting this useless tool.",1
2023-09-23 15:16:29,LockedOut,"Pathetic way to treat users. The in-app browser isn't as functional as one which is standalone, yet you can't open links elsewhere let alone copy links. In addition, any element you can add to your account (such as a group, or connection) should also be removable as well.

Worst of all, if you’re entering form data on a page and switch apps to get info to complete the form, expect the garbage LinkedIn app to close the web view and lose any progress you made, because LinkedIn isn’t interested in being useful to you. They’re only interested in you consuming content so they can shove ads down your throat.",1
2023-02-17 20:46:24,Have fun starting an application over 10+ times,"Do you need to go to another app to copy and paste something from your resume? Would you like to look something up, or have your answers prepared in another document? WELL TOO BAD now you get to start that entire application over and we didn’t save ANY of it. I don’t care if this application is asking for you to answer 10 different questions and upload multiple documents you better be READY to answer them all without changing your screen once. Not my problem buddy. Auto save feature? What even is that? Just goes to show nobody wants to work these days.",1
2022-01-01 19:20:26,Freezing While Scrolling,"Ever since the update to iOS 15, LinkedIn keeps freezing during scrolling while on the job search results. It has not gotten any better with the two or three updates to the app since then. As soon as the screen stops moving and you try to scroll again, the page is unresponsive until you try two or three more times. This is super frustrating. Aside from that, general usability has been ok. Though, it took forever to get dark mode rolled out.",3
2021-02-19 00:00:11,Truly impossible to enjoyably browse.,"This app has gone so far off the rails in usability that it’s hardly worth using if you have reasonable PC access. I can’t tell what’s a post, a share, or an advertisement half of the time and by the time I start to resolve that and scroll on? The screen starts rearranging trying to jam another ad through and I lose my place only to see the post I was about to view is no longer in the feed. 

Basically, the app is much too bloated. Ad if LinkedIn’s exorbitant monthly subscription fees are the only way to make the app tolerable, I’ll pass.",3
2019-03-11 21:45:38,Don’t get premium,"Basic LinkedIn is decent, gets the job done. I tried the free 30 day trial period and mistakenly forgot to end and was charged $60 for the next month. That’s my fault, but I still can’t even see who is looking at my profile. “A job recruiter has viewed your profile, add more info to see who.” I have nothing else to fill out, I am a LinkedIn all-star with full job titles and descriptions, education and certifications submitted as well as recommendations and over 400 connections. If I have to pay $60 for the month, it better be awesome, but it isn’t.",3
2018-06-28 17:54:44,Performance,"I like this product and use it all the time for making connections, but over the last two years I’m surprised by how bad the engineering quality of the iOS app has become. 
In this update I could tell the cells in the news feed got a nice redesign but the scrolling experience becomes even worse than before, my screen could literally freeze for a half second when scrolling up and down. However I had experienced worse bug before that it didn’t allow me to pay for subscription, and comparing to that this is nothing. I just feel sad for your guys.",2
2018-03-06 13:56:41,Unsaving items needs fixing,"In general the app works well for me, except for unsaving items.  The three little dots you’re supposed to tap to bring up the unsave option are too small, so I often end up repeatedly re-opening the article I just read.  And more times than not, when I finally do get to the unsave option, it doesn’t actually unsave the article, so I end up having to select unsave multiple times. It’s a big waste of time and really frustrating to start reading an article only to realize I’ve already read it.",3
2023-08-09 21:24:44,Use zip recruiter if you want a job,"For a full month and a half, I applied to jobs like crazy on this app. All I got was email after email after email saying they were not interested. (These are jobs I am qualified for and have relevant experience for). Two weeks on zip recruiter and I found a well paying job with benefits, without lowering my standards at all.

I am not sure if LinkedIn’s algorithm for vetting people is just awful or if people use LinkedIn to make it seem like their business is growing when it’s not. Either way, it is a social media app first. Don’t be fooled like I was.",2
2023-07-14 03:30:33,Horrible service,"I set up an account and had worked on it almost 3 days during a transitioning course in the military and on the 4th day I was logged off and put on restriction until I verified my account with a source of ID. After sending in my information with my source of ID I waited and got an email on the same day that my account has been permanently restricted but won’t say anything on why it was restricted due to violating a user agreement policies which I haven’t violated anything. And when I was trying to figure out a way I could contact them, the only way possible is to have an account which I don’t have access to.",1
2022-09-14 23:40:49,Can’t select messages,"The message icon in the top right corner of the screen does not work. Users are unable to select it and can only access LinkedIn messages through iPhone notifications. Obviously, this is important functionality that premium members pay for! iOS 15 iPhone 12 Pro Max. Update: Uninstall and reinstall worked. Messages can be accessed as expected.",5
2019-12-28 15:07:08,Good - But Better with Landscape Mode and Larger Fonts,"This is one of my favorite apps, but it is uncomfortable to read for any length of time, because the Font is so small.  My only request is that the font is too small to read comfortably.  If you could allow the reader to choose between even a small, medium or large font and to use this in landscape mode it would be fantastic!!!!   Take a look a what Time magazine's application does.  Nice Application though.

Support for Dark Mode would also be helpful.",4
2020-01-28 04:09:38,Most frustrating app ever,"It took me 15 minutes to simply log in to the app even though I have been using the web version for a couple years. The app kept trying to sign in with Google.
Once I was signed in to my account, the app forced me to press ‘skip for now’ on four different pages trying to get me to connect with more people.
The app overall is slow and buggy. There are many popups in the usual LinkedIn fashion of trying to get more ‘connections’. At some point, I want to use the app for what I want to do on it instead of having to skip through all the crap that LinkedIn forces to pop up.

My advice: stick to the web version as the lesser of two evils.",1
2019-03-18 15:59:50,Great app but don’t like some notifications with no content,"LinkedIn is great and puts job searching and career networking at your fingertips. It does the job and I liked how you can get instant messaging and notifications about your network. My only complaint is that I get a red 1 “Notification” everyday, and sometimes it only says “You’re all caught up” when I open the app. It’s pretty irritating. For me, it’s solely there to make sure I open the app everyday and I wish that feature was removed.",4
2019-07-01 17:24:58,Professional Social Media,"Social Media can bring out the worst in people, allowing them to grand stand, berate and criticize others. Linked -In on the other hand, brings people together, allowing them to connect with others in sharing professional interests, success stories and celebrating the good wool of others. It is the only forum I use. 
As a retired educator, I can keep in touch with colleagues and former students, while connecting with many of their contacts.",5
2023-04-01 23:35:37,Chat keeps crashing the app,"I’ve lost more than a dozen drafts in the last few versions. It either crashes in the middle of typing, or hangs and takes up to 60 secs to send. When it crashes, sometimes my draft is partially there, but often it’s completely gone. When it hangs, the text is gone, arrow grays out, and you’re left wondering if the message sent. Sometimes I will go to highlight one or two words to correct them, then all the text disappears, forcing me to start over.",3
2019-01-27 06:30:34,Making people victim for their poor Rules coding,Poor coding says that I use automated machine to send connections and Invite. It feels frustration even though you use Iphone and there no such thing called automation to view and send connections to profiles. 2 warnings and then blocks the account. I have 9000+ connections next time they said am gonna get permanently blocked for sending connections? So much effort went in to find those valuable connections. LinkedIn is for networking and if they stop me from doing it then this is one of the worst networking app. It's not just me but 25people in my organization got permanently banned bacause of their poor coding strategy. I wouldn't recommend this app.,1
2018-12-13 14:24:31,Can’t even report an error!,"Overall I have no issues with the app except when something in the programming breaks and it continues to tell me I have notifications but I don’t! When I try to report it and attach a screen shot, it kicks me back to the main page that loads when I open the app. Seems like the problem isn’t consistent either. The notification issue will happen for a month or 2, then get fixed for a while, then come back. But to not even be able to report it easily is ridiculous. I have even gone to the website from my laptop to check the notifications in hopes that the app would remove them but nope!",1
2018-04-21 05:51:57,Serves its purpose BUT why can’t I post to my company page from the app?,"He app is good for personal/individual use and it has served its purpose for searching for candidates and jobs for many years.   However, with so many other social options for posting as a business this app is far behind.  There is no way to post articles or photos or updates to my LinkedIn company page as a company page admin.  Why?  It’s 2018 and it’s time to make this change.  Thank you for your consideration.",4
2022-10-10 23:10:46,Customer Service,"This complaint is in the form of a review due to the lack of customer service availability. While I respect what you platform does the availability of customer service and help is lacking. Also, more specific to the reason I was reaching out after creating 90% of a very important communication with a prospective future employer when I received a call and all was lost. All I needed was an answer is the message recoverable. This is not addressed on your help page and investing in any customer relations apparently is not the Linked In way. Disappointing is all I have to say.",2
2020-06-21 13:11:45,Could be better,"I’m not trying to say someone needs to be fired, but your team needs to have a serious sit down and actually take into account all issues brought up by other customers.

My complaint and review (which is rare, I hate writing reviews) is because I utilized LI to find a job in the past and support the concept of social networking in the work force.

I never had significant issues with the App until it began repeating push notifications exactly three times in a row, the same notification. I want notifications on, but I don’t want to be spammed with them one after the last goes off screen. It’s distracting, happens at random times, and sometimes causes me to unintentionally open the app because I was playing a game or trying to click the text field for the web browser, but instead are whisked away to LI because of these annoying push notifications.

Please fix this issue and I’ll consider changing my review.",2
2022-11-18 18:08:01,App is great However…,"When searching for a job the “on-site, remote, hybrid” drop down needs more options to include traveling. Or maybe a separate drop down that includes the percentage of travel. So 0% is what I would choose.

The other issue I’m coming across is when I receive the job recommendations it’s pulling jobs that are on-site & hybrid all over the country. Job recommendations should be at least local on-site/hybrid and/or remote.",4
2023-10-04 16:59:38,Not Great On Phone,"Not sure why, but I only receive “promoted” jobs as options while browsing roles on mobile, these usually do not match my profile which makes searching for jobs on the app much worse than the browser. Also after having LinkedIn premium for about half a year I can say it is pretty unnecessary, the jobs they recommend saying “top applicant” usually do not even bother with an interview opportunity. It is frustrating when LinkedIn tells you that you are a “top applicant” and you never actually hear back.",2
2023-07-18 20:28:02,Eh it’s okay,"LinkedIn is not as good as it once was. It became more like Facebook than a job search site. LinkedIn never found me a job even though I applied for several. LinkedIn does not give much help when it comes to resume building, networking, or help actually landing the job you qualify for. The only reason I pay for LinkedIn is for LinkedIn learning, but that doesn’t help in any way getting a job, it just keeps my knowledge fresh. 
Overall LinkedIn in has been a rather disappointing job search app.",3
2022-03-08 15:02:09,"Great app, needs improvement","I love LinkedIn, but I have some major gripes with it. First, we need to be able to upload larger photos. For some reason they use resolution rather than file size. This means that anyone uploading photos with a full frame camera will not only have to reduce the file size, but crop the image. No other major platform requires you to crop a landscape photo in order to post. When searching for a new job, the search is also pretty bad. It rarely shows relevant results.",3

Hasn’t happened with any other post. Tried to find a way of letting LinkedIn know about this, and there doesn’t seem to be a method of providing feedback, except through reviews.  So, it’d be nice if y’all could fix the problem with Blue Lives Matter’s posts, and would be especially nice if you included a  method of providing feedback on the app.",3
2020-10-19 15:05:09,Do not do the free trial of premium!,"I really do like LinkedIn with the free stuff. They kept advertising to do the 30 day trial for free. I tried it out and I didn’t care for it. Some of it was nice but not for $30 a month. If I don’t have a job, why would I waste $30 a month on the chances of someone maybe liking my profile? I tried to cancel the free trial and it told I had to contact apple to cancel. Why do I need to contact apple to stop a free trial with LinkedIn? Doesn’t make sense. After they charged my account on day 31 of having the premium it allowed me to cancel on the app. Bottom line: do not try the premium with LinkedIn. It’s a scam",2
2019-02-18 04:58:14,Job Search Feature Not Working,"I am not sure when your newest update came out, but for the past 3+ weeks when I go to look at different jobs it says “no job recommendations.” It won’t even show me the current alerts I have, jobs I’ve saved, etc. I never had this problem before, and now I can’t actually look for anything. 

When I type in a specific job and location, including alerts I current have, recommendations will pop up. But I don’t want to have to do that every time and I want the ability to see my saved jobs and saved alerts. 

The other job search app doesn’t work as well as what this one did before, so I don’t like to use it. It doesn’t give the option to delete/remove a recommendation if I know that I do not want that position. 

It would be wonderful if this could be fixed or if someone could help me with this issue.",3
2017-11-22 03:34:34,Way too many notifications!,"There's a lot of notification configurations, but I could never find a way to get it to only notify me if there was a message sent directly to me. The app kept notifying me when it thought I might know somebody, or somebody I knew posted something, and so on! I will say it's possible that I could have better configured the notifications, but I'm a software developer by trade, so if I can't figure it out by myself that's kind of a ""fail"" in my book. I ultimately uninstalled the app because nobody seems to use LinkedIn unless they're headhunting or actively looking for a job, anyway.",2
2023-02-14 15:39:44,Paying to Message?,"I’ve always liked using LinkedIn. It’s been a great way to connect with people, network, and is easy to use. It helped me find a job when I was moving to a different state. Now I’m trying to switch careers and in order to message someone I have to pay for a premium subscription? This had made it really hard to meet someone in the field I’m interested in. I wish it was still free to message because now I have no way of reaching different people in this field.",3

Also posts from groups you are in do NOT appear on your newsfeed, you have to physically search and click on the group to view the posts. What is the point of groups at that point?? No excuse as to why something so simple is unavailable on the mobile app. Get it together app developers, and make the mobile experience better for your users.",2

They literally collect what you do outside of the app. :) Especially what others apps you download and how you use/what you type in them. They also keep track of what you buy online that’s not on LinkedIn. Your pictures aren’t safe either as they can browse through them and sneakily listen to you on the microphone.",1

Cliche quotes, status quo information, and other societal “truths” seem to rule the people’s beliefs and what they support on the platform.

If you differ from that, and challenge beliefs etc, good luck. That may be social media and dealing with people in general, but the fact that I got blocked and still have no idea why, seems strange to me. Anyway, wishing everyone the best. But this platform could improve in that area.",2

Also, the count of profile views goes up, but no additional people are added to the list of who’s viewed the profile.

And eventually, I get this cryptic response telling me I’m banned, without ever explaining why :( 

“We've deemed the activity in your account is in violation of the LinkedIn User Agreement and Professional Community Policies. Your appeal has been denied and your account has been restricted permanently.”

You have to start a subscription to even get the trial and they are hoping you forget to cancel after the month so you keep getting charged. That’s sad and pathetic. I will never try your trial because of this, even if I ended up liking premium. Stop being money grubbers and give a real free trial, and then at the end send a message saying the trial has ended and if I would like to sign up then I can.

2018-10-10 03:17:30,Feedback: One star for visibility,"Hello LinkedIn dev team,

I used to not use LinkedIn as much as I do now. Thanks to you for providing us with so many new features that are being added. This is how a real social network should have always been.

The reason for 1 star is:
I am an ardent follower of the daily rundowns. But, I wouldn’t read all the content in a single go. Instead, I take multiple turns throughout the day to read all of it. Here’s the problem. 

When I open LinkedIn and say, read two paragraphs and went on to read an email and then do my chores and then come back to LinkedIn after, say, an hour, to pick up where I left off. This is where LinkedIn redirects me to its home page. No, I didn’t close the app, it’s running in the background. I would love to continue with the content where I left it off earlier. 

I have seen no other app does this except LinkedIn.

TL;DR I want LinkedIn to show me the content where I left off earlier than always redirecting me to homepage.",1

LinkedIn also makes it virtually impossible to provide feedback or report a bug. They clearly do NOT want to hear from their platform users. Thus this review.,2
2019-10-25 08:34:09,Annoying notifications,"Badge notifications are so common, they’re useless. I only want numbered badge notifications for messages. Instead, the app gives notifications on everything—-whenever any of my 500+ contacts posts anything, which is all the time.  Very very annoying.  This makes notifications effectively useless.  Maybe someone should send the LinkedIn app dev team a copy of The Boy Who Cried Wolf.",5
2020-12-15 02:34:48,Latest update is bad news,"I have to re login on every. Single. Launch. FIX IT NOW! Also, I think you people highly overestimate how much people want your platform for content. Right now, all the sections (notifications, jobs, people) are telling me “something went wrong” and it isn’t functional. But the feed—the thing I neither want nor need—is working just fine. This is garbage. The new interface is cleaner. I applaud your UX designers for bringing you forward from 2013. But I’d gladly take the old UI working again over this horrible update. I get you’re working on it but c’mon—this is basic stuff. This release never should have made it out of the gate.",1
2018-05-10 01:49:25,App force closes,"I am on iOS 11.3.1. Each time I open the app and navigate to an inmail and click on the text box to start typing a response, the app force closes. I read a couple of the developer response to uninstall and reinstall the app. I did that but it didn’t solve the problem. You guys need to fix this bug.

Update:
I just updated to the latest version and I don’t see the app close. I guess it’s fixed. Thanks!",5
2017-11-02 09:45:41,LinkedIn,"I’ve been using LinkedIn regularly for about 5-6 years. I found and applied for my current job thru the app and I’m a big fan of LinkedIn because of it. I love that all my work and volunteer history is saved and is easily found and read by others seeking talent. How nice to be found vs. always looking. I recommend LinkedIn to everyone, it’s the present and future of recruitment and job search. Thank you!",5
2023-08-22 18:33:04,Issues resolved,"Something was glitchy and I was locked out of my account. An email was sent saying my account violated the policies and it was permanently restricted. After several days and a reply email from me - another email came and the issue was resolved. My account is again in good standing and I can access it, again. Patience paid off.",5
2021-11-25 09:42:08,No accessibility for older generation iPhones and iOS,"Hi, I am with iPhone 6 iOS 12.5.5. When opening your app there is a message coming in the middle of the screen and it always says “Taking you to our mobile site” and it doesn’t allow me to proceed further. I have already tried to uninstall and installation of an older version has been requested by the phone but still the same message comes. Can you please make accessibility for older generation iPhones and iOS? Thank you!",3
2022-07-28 18:29:39,Horrible Update,"Won’t save job postings all of the time; have to click multiple times and this was for each posting I wanted to save. 

I try to enter in a “mileage filter,” and it doesn’t work EVER. I pick 5 or 10 miles and I still get results for 30 miles away (into the city which can be a 60 minute to a 3 hour drive), not to mention hundreds to THOUSANDS of miles away. 🙄 And yes I know how to use the app. You just rolled out a horrible update. This is by far the worst update ever. At this point, it’s looking as pitiful as Carrerbuilder was 20 years ago.",2
2018-12-28 22:47:52,Can’t even create an account,"I know this is a great platform, however the app for the iPhone won’t even let me create an account, due to the robot security feature. I tried several, like 30 times clicking the pictures, girlfriend tried as well. I imagine the system is messed up; however, I do recommend swapping out the picture clicking with typing in the letters feature. I will just go on my laptop when I have free time to create an account.",4
2021-06-22 10:21:30,Tech issues,"Every time I hit the back button after viewing a job posting, it resets the search parameters. Very annoying and inconvenient. I don’t see how that would ever be a useful feature. 

When I clicked the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the emails they were sending me, instead of taking me to a page I could unsubscribe from email notifications, it took me to the homepage of the app. I had to navigate to this page myself. 

The app itself also is not user friendly. It’s hard to find the information you were just editing after you hit save.",1
2019-12-05 05:43:33,Need improvements,"I appreciate the app however I'd like to be able to multi-select various options.   I'd also like to be able to scroll to the bottom and automatically get more jobs rather than having to click the button. The recent update seems to have removed the ability to select the category such at technology and healthcare.   The recent update has also created an annoying ""get alerts"" message at the bottom that pops up and disappears each time you scroll.",3
2017-11-22 03:09:13,LinkedIn App is making it easier,I think the App has improved a lot. The changes with LI some months ago were hard to swallow and frustrating. The App continues to add features that exist on the desktop and in some cases even more benefits. I've noticed most recently that it is making it easier to communicate and also find contacts. Sometimes even providing topics for the conversation -- like to comment on their recent post. This can enhance the conversation.,4
2018-07-24 16:41:19,It’s a great app but...,"LinkedIn really needs to start vetting the companies they allow to post job listings. I got a call from a job post I replied to only to go look up information  about the company and to discover it was nothing more than a glorified pyramid scheme. Same thing happened to my friend, I expect these things on Monster or Indeed but LinkedIn is supposed to be better than this. Please vet the companies you allow to post jobs otherwise there’s this app is pointless.",4
2017-10-03 04:38:47,Offensive.,Do I want to sync????  Are the developers really that stupid that they don’t remember they’ve gotten answer to that question each and every time I’ve tried to use your intrusive app. Or - do they all suffer from untreated narcissistic personality disorder and not give two flying flips  about the privacy wishes of their users and the rights of those contacts not to have their personal information crowd sourced.  What could be an invaluable tool...an app built to create a worldwide professional community instead is an insufferable sham...an app that Commoditize contact information that has been shared with individuals for  personal use...Not to be shared or crowd sourced by a corporation!,1
2021-05-04 14:33:01,Phakedup don’t install,"LinkedIn has become bolshet. The messages inbox icon is on top where the post something personal bolshet icon is in bottom which is very easy and accessible. This way folks are more tempted to post personal drama on LinkedIn. Professionalism is gone!!!! They should be vice versa in the place. 2nd every time there’s update, it has the same description “when you’re in a conversation, speed is important” something like that. Madafaka how much speed do we need to send a basic message and to install more updates is to giving up our privacy since these updates breech your privacy.",1
2020-04-14 17:38:56,Needs significant improvement,"I keep this app because it has so many people and jobs in one place. However, Indeed is far superior in terms of actually managing job applications. I want to be able to archive jobs I’ve applied to through LinkedIn and am no longer in consideration for, as well as keep track of those I’m interviewing for in the app. I feel like this data would be helpful to LinkedIn as well? Right now it’s really difficult to find a job description when someone contacts me for an interview and all the jobs I’ve ever applied to can’t be searched/sorted AT ALL.",2
2019-04-06 12:04:55,"Great website, great content, terrible app","You’d think for a company that thrives on networking for other companies would at least have the technical support to upkeep an app in the modern times. 

Unfortunately, the LinkedIn app is laced with bugs and it’s slower than most social media apps. I find the lagging leads to repeated postings, information isn’t saving, and I just realized I’ve wasted 15 minutes trying to update one component of my profile. Total waste of time. 

I’m new to LinkedIn in a sense, but I appreciate its efforts. Still, I think I’ll be sticking to their website version, not this poorly run app.",2
2019-03-01 12:17:11,Poor functioning application.,"I don’t understand. For a website, that focuses, and emphasizes professionalism, their app is terrible to use. Continuously, when I try to apply to jobs, the app crashes, and can’t even handle me putting in an email, or a simple data entry. I’ll try to open it again, after successfully closing it, and the app CRASHES again. My phone isn’t even old. Then when the app does work, I have to find that job again, and try to re apply. Certain features such as importing your profile for a job employer to see, don’t work. This application is poor, for those of us who work on the move.",1
2018-01-09 02:31:56,Great Networking Site,This is a great way to network business wise. I think I have used  this more to get to know people and businesses that I want to work for. But I just wish the same way you connect with people on the desktop with the small short message should be incorporated with the mobile as well. Its more professional and you get to let the person know why you want to connect with them. This gives more connections to be accepted.,4
2022-08-30 12:25:42,Experiencing glitches. Love the app.,I like LinkedIn! I’m experiencing glitches right now when editing my posts from my iPhone and from my iPad. When I try to back space it jumps to the end of the post. I’ve been writing my post outside of LinkedIn and copying and pasting. Also the issue makes tagging difficult. The issue is the same for both devices.,5
2023-09-17 16:33:14,"Good opportunities, with glitches","Linked in has been great in searching for jobs or having employers reach out to me.   But there have always been glitches that the company seems to know about but doesn’t do anything to fix them.   I have a very common glitch where it says I have notifications, but when I log in and click the notifications button there is nothing.      It’s hard to know if I actually have a job opportunity or a bug.",3
2022-08-28 20:35:22,I’m a little torn as to what to think,This hole internet and web three thing I’ve been on. well it’s been greatest thing that ever happened to me but at the same time it’s been the worst year of my life. I have been self teaching myself internet safety with the help of Ai as well I have quite a story to tell but I need some more time gather facts to explain but I like this site it’s the humans that get to me lol,5
2020-04-26 15:07:34,Amazingly Professional,Incredibly professional. He was able to get our stuff done under very adverse circumstances. He was able to get everything done as quickly as possible and he was very accommodating. I cannot Think of one detail that was missed or one way that this office did not tend to every single thing we needed. I would recommend this place to anybody for anything.,5
2022-07-25 22:18:36,No Customer Support,"I work for a company that posts regularly on LinkedIn. I decided to merge my personal account to my business account for the sake of efficiency. My business account had access to the company page & allowed me to post. However, I didn't know that when merging accounts you lose access. It didnt say that when I merged accounts. I went to get customer service but the help page is useless. Most of the advice was outdated & there was no answer for this. There is no chat box or service agent either (unless you pay the fee). LinkedIn has been a huge pain for this.",1
2021-12-06 10:25:33,They make money by selling your info,So this platform is making more money by selling your info to a third-party company that they use your own info and resell them again plus that they asking you to be premium to pay fees as well they will keep selling your information to make more money either you paying them or not it’s untrusted and I don’t believe that they say it’s number one platform on social media it’s all fake and they always I always get many scammers who called me trying to do a social engineering on me by steeling my information because they got my info from this app :/,1
2021-08-17 20:48:29,A little unorganized,"It would be great if there was a way to sort out the jobs you’ve already applied for. That way the jobs you have an interview for you can mark them for that category. Jobs that have passed on you, maybe you can move to another location or mark as not selected by employer. When you’re really job hunting and putting in lots of applications it’s all jumbled and keeping track of who’s reached out, who’s passed on you gets frustrating.",3
2021-05-09 18:20:45,Good resource,"I use this through my local library account. I like the content and found the switch from Lynda to linked-in learning was easy. The main issue I notice is when I log in. There is no way to remember my credentials? I have to enter the portal invitation and then my library card information each time I enter. This is extremely annoying, especially on mobile. Hopefully this is fixed soon. I will update review and rating once this is fixed.",3
2021-01-22 16:28:49,App rating,"LinkedIn is a great website/concept, HOWEVER this app could be WAY better. There are many tiny flaws that makes the experience poor. It takes forever to update information, and sometimes to navigate through the app. Notifications on phone, apparently aren’t sound notifications so it’s hard to keep updated if your preoccupied with other tasks. Again, I love LinkedIn however the app and its technological features could use some tweaking for a more efficient and stress free experience.",3
2020-03-19 04:47:55,Issues with Uploading Profile Photo,"I’ve recently had an issue where when I try to upload a new profile photo, it puts a really dark “filter” essentially over my photo. I don’t want to have a filter on the image but I tried to delete the app and upload a photo again and it still does the same thing. Not really sure what to do to prevent this from happening! With my old profile image, this wasn’t an issue!",4
2020-02-04 14:30:34,"So slow, unreliable (iOS user)","Am I the only one? LinkedIn is probably the least reliable app I have...it takes an insane amount of time to load. I rarely will use the app anymore and save any searches for when I’m on my desktop. I’m not sure if it has to do w my settings or what, but LinkedIn is by far the most frustrating app on my phone. I’ve deleted and reinstalled several times.

 I have to resort to removing the app from my phone and using LinkedIn on chrome...but why should I have to do that especially when I’m paying for an expensive LinkedIn premium account? Makes no sense!",1
2019-01-12 02:11:59,Linked In,"What is happening???  I’m trying to click the X on individuals I don’t know or want to connect with, and when I click the X it SENDS AN INVITE TO CONNECT????   Hitting the X was supposed to delete NOW IT SENDS AN INVITE....nuts!!!

Glad I’m not a premium subscriber....I’d REALLY BE GOOFED UP! So many sneaky app’s, so many trying to get their hand in your wallet😐🙄😒

And another thing, your app asks me if I know a person, I click DISMISS...SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE IT ACTUALLY DISMISSES😳 

Apple updates, YOU UPDATE, Verizon UPDATES, Microsoft updates, N O N E OF YOU E V E R COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER......NO WONDER APPS ARE SO CONFUSED....PITIFUL!!

    HANG ON....WHILE I ....UPDATE🙄

Got a reply to this review, forgot about the frustration because I believe you’ve handled the issues with an apparent update...so all is good.....sorry about the frustraions😌😊😉👍 adjusted your Star level😁",5
2017-12-02 15:33:09,"Used to be great, now, not so much.","Six months ago, I would’ve given the LinkedIn app a four or five star rating. Now since Microsoft has tried to monetize it in a (sadly annoying) traditional way, it is difficult for me to use the app because of the constant video pop-ups and advertisements that I get. LinkedIn used to be a great tool for business networking and searching for work. Now, since I have to dodge so many ads and pop-ups (a pop up video 4-5x in the middle of watching a video? C’mon!! Horrible UX.) I’m looking elsewhere like Glassdoor, Indeed, etc. for my job searches and networking.",2
2017-11-11 19:29:13,More important than Facebook,"LinkedIn is a platform similar to Facebook, except in LinkedIn you build connections with people in industries that you are interested in. You also connect with a diverse group of people. Sharing ideas, learning about jobs, and applying for jobs are a few of the pros to the app. 
I have no doubt that the global job market will pivot on LinkedIn in a matter of a few years",5
2022-03-07 16:48:36,I can’t believe it after many years,"After I have LinkedIn account for many years, LinkedIn closed my account because of their policy.

I have blog for my own personal shop and it will automatic following to my LinkedIn account. I have done that for few years. Last night LinkedIn sent a email to me to close my account. I went to website and sent them my personal ID to appear the case and reopen my account. No luck, they just reply said I violated their policy and closed my account temporarily. I didn’t spam my blog postings to anyone in LinkedIn, it’s only post on my own LinkedIn page.",1
2020-07-16 01:46:38,Loved the new push notification changes,"Loved the new changes on push notification related to job postings. It used to just notify that a company posted a new job. But now it says xyz posted a new abc role and we think you are a good fit!

2017-12-22 23:55:54,Problem with feed,There are definitely problems with the feed since the previous update. One story continues to get “stuck” at the top and will stay there (for days) until I go into the options to hide that post. Once I do that another story gets stuck there. I used to use this app for the feed all the time in those times when I had a few minutes to review and would get caught up in all of the interesting and timely posts.  That isn’t the case any longer. I now find it frustrating. I am hoping this can be fixed.,2
2022-05-08 16:58:22,Poor feed algorithm,"Deleting app because it doesn’t afford for the feed to be set to “most recent” like I can on a desk/laptop. In general, there should be refined controls to adjust the types of posts you see from a person/business you follow. I.e. I am interested in seeing business updates/article posts from a company but don’t want my feed inundated with the myriad of random peoples “So happy to announce I’ve accepted a job with [said company]..!” posts that same company has “liked”",3
2021-06-09 13:50:04,Notifications no longer working,"For the last several weeks, after I set my iOS settings for LinkedIn to send all notifications directly to Notification Center (no Banners, no Lock Screen) and with no sounds or badges, ALL of LinkedIn’s push notifications ceased on my iPhone [And they are correctly turned on in LinkedIn app settings]. The Developer responded inside the App Store app - with a short link that I can neither copy into a browser nor click. The problem is still not solved. But if they don’t want to give me reason to go into this app, that just gives me more free time 👍.",1
2018-04-01 12:16:17,More upload options,"As oppose to just being able to upload media ( projects, presentations, and such) there should be an option on both the desktop and mobile platforms to upload a full resume. I work with the federal government and my resume does not fit into your little blocks. Users should be able to upload a word or pdf document of their resume for recruiters to look at. This will make it better for the job seekers as well as the hiring officials.",3
2018-06-10 05:03:00,Spammy,"I appreciate the networking opportunities, but it's gotten so spammy. I don't need a 5+ minute checkup on why I'm using the app, what additional career changes I might have had, what LinkedIn celebrities I want to follow, and who else I might know every time I use the app. It's out of hand!

The website is the same. If you add or accept a friend request it forwards you to another dead-end page asking you to add 50 more friends. No, I don't want to do that, I want to accept a friend and get to my feed.

People don't want to be spammed out of their minds on a professional social network; it's unprofessional.",2
2018-04-03 18:19:07,Bugs need to be fixed ASAP,"This app used to work great until the most recent update 5 days ago. I am currently running iOS 11.3 and have the app up to date. But every time I receive a notification and go to the app to check it out, the app will crash as soon as I touch to view what new comment was left on my post or article. If I delete the app and re-install it, it will work for me to view the notifications one time. Then next time I go into the app to view my notifications, it will crash again. No one has time to delete and re-install the app every time they need to view the notifications.",1
2019-02-27 14:17:38,Glitchy App,"While significant improvements have been made in the past year, LinkedIn remains one of the glitchy-ist apps for any type of professional representation on social media. Constant error messages when trying to update skills or add work experience, errors when trying to modify or delete skills and issues when updating profile pictures, and STILL no way to update background image without using a separate device with a full web browser!",3
2022-08-15 03:22:48,Confusing and incomplete,"Confusing interface designed to get you to send (spam) email to people not already on LinkedIn. * Imports contacts into Linkedin but doesn’t give you a way to see just which of those aren’t on linkedIn without throwing other random people into the list. * Won’t let you import contacts from LinkedIn to AddressBook - for that you need 3rd party apps. Ironic that a site that makes such a big deal about protecting privacy generates more incoming spam for me than just about anything else, and now using its app I see why, (I just sent some unintentionally).",1
2021-02-08 22:34:35,Don’t like the forceful downloads,"I personally do no appreciate any app, biz or website that forces you to download. All I wanted to do was change a setting on my linked in profile to remove that in open to job openings and it forced me to download to do that on my phone if I wanted to change it on a mobile device. When a company does that it feels like entrapment and that they want that access to the information and stats they pull from your phone to their app. I immediately removed it. It may not matter to others but I feel it’s pretty sketchy.",2
2019-04-05 23:11:57,Unnecessary security check,"I have tried to log in several times from the app itself, but every time I log in it takes me to a security page when I have to verify I am not a robot. Then after I pass with a 100% accuracy it takes me to another unnecessary step in which they have to send a security link to my email, then I will open this email with the SECURITY CHECK  which it will take me to the mobile site which I don’t need to be taken to. Then i will go back to the app, and try to log in ONCE AGAIN, and guess what?...............it freaking happens again. Software Team please address this and fix it.",1
2023-04-16 00:29:06,Zero credibility,"I took time out of my life to reach out to LinkedIn customer service to show them a profile of a 67 y/o man using a 40 years younger image of himself. I explained that it deceived me into believing he was much younger, but Unfortunately he turned out to be a crook and got me for $350.

 I NEVER would have done business with the shady character he looks like now. LinkedIn thumbed their nose up at me and said we don’t care.  People can use deceptive images of themselves, and they have allowed him to continue using a false image of himself.  Please don’t think LinkedIn offers credibility because They don’t.",1

Or be mid job search, then have to scroll into the depths of the job listing abyss each time?!

2018-12-01 15:59:39,Security issues,"I am pretty sure LinkedIn has access to my email and phone address books, even though I have that function turned off. It has been suggesting me to add random people like a plumber from a city I lived in 12 years ago. The only way it would know to connect us would be from an email I sent him back in the day. Other random people I have emailed over the years are also popping up. What’s worse is, when I tap the X to close the suggestion, it sends them a invite request instead!!! There is no way to undo it either. I do not trust LinkedIn or their app at all. Stay away.",1
2018-03-07 04:41:40,Far inferior functionality than desktop site,"The app is adequate for the simple stuff like accepting connections, messaging and newsfeed, but beyond that you should stick with the desktop website. Job searches lack filters and ordering, it’s not possible to perform people searches with any useful criteria such as filtering by company, and the increased real estate of the app on tablets is woefully under utilized.

I see posts about jobs that CLOSED three weeks ago but if someone in my network likes a post completely irrelevant to me, I’ll see that immediately! The social feed function is driven by a truly terrible algorithm that makes LinkedIn irrelevant as an app. I’m better off just visiting the desktop site occasionally to update my profile and check job alerts (and at least that has a sort by time feature).",2

I am just upgrading my comment above because it still stands. I wanted to write somebody on LinkedIn but I  still cannot because it says I have to get the app.  Well I can’t get the app not yet.

Also, I reported a scam profile multiple times that was using my picture and name but they never did anything about it, so that tells me there could be a lot of fake profiles on this app too.

Keep doing great things!",3

I view someone’s profile while I’m private, and a few minutes later i get a notification that they viewed my profile. This has happened numerous times. You’re telling me this is a coincidence? There is obviously a lag time between when I switch from public to private, the privacy settings dont change instantly. You need to fix this.",1

It will be interesting to see where Microsoft takes the capabilities over the long term.",5
2017-11-12 01:42:47,Too many notifications,"App sends an obscene amount of notifications for useless info that hardly anyone would care about. On top of this it is such a convoluted and complicated process to disable them. For anyone that actually uses notifications for what they’re supposed to be for and makes an effort to stay up to date on things, it’s frustrating to go into the app and find notifications about birthdays and notifications about articles linked to by my network. It’s more annoying than useful, and absolutely pointless, so I’ll be using web based platform instead.",1
2023-10-23 18:19:59,WAYYYYY too many useless notifications,"If LinkedIn was more responsible about not sending repetitive, useless notifications, I wouldn’t have to turn them off completely. I’d like to know when someone engages with me, but I don’t want to be told EVERY FEW HOURS that I have notifications waiting. If I didn’t read them when they came through, I don’t plan to read them until I’m ready. You need to put users first instead of your app open metrics.",3

This app is not good for job hunting, Indeed is better for that than this pathetic garbage. The posts of “professional” recruiters and workers is more unhinged than than facebook. In fact this is basically that: Just an awful job board combine with facebook.
The only pro of linked is that it helps format a resume for you to use but other than that, its one of thr few websites that I avoid and LinkedIn has gotton considerably worse over the years.",1

I’ve submitted my identification 2 or 3 times already and it’s been months and they still haven’t reviewed it. I hate this app, it is so stupid. I only use it because employers for some reason do their hiring through it, even though it’s the dumbest social media platform ever created. 

In addition, people on this app hate freedom of speech and will report you if they don’t agree with your opinions, which is probably why my account got restricted.",1
2022-03-21 04:21:33,Suggestion,I love LinkedIn it’s a pretty good app I always recommend it to people but here are a few suggestions it would be nice if LinkedIn would have their own virtual hiring event through the app virtual breakout rooms where we can get on and video chat or group chat people in our field virtual interviews with the companies/hiring manager that we want to work for also it doesn’t have beauty as a industry on here which is surprising seaming as hair and make up is part of the beauty industry,3

2020-10-28 01:09:56,How can an app in 2020 not offer rotation support?,"App is ok as far as it goes, but it baffles me why the devs do not support rotation. Sometimes the vertical orientation cuts off parts of words in a headline, profile,  etc. Rather than clicking on useless link, I often rotate my phone on other apps/websites to get more in and decide whether to click the link. But not in this app. (Also not on the website, so it’s a conscious decision by LinkedIn.) I installed the app because a couple features weren’t available on the website.",3

Oh didn’t they tell you that these trillion dollar companies have done away with human interaction entirely.

I switch back to LinkedIn, and while most sensible apps would allow you to continue where you left off…nope. Gone. I was like, “No way the app could be this bad,” so I scrolled down to the post I was responding to, hit the Comment button, and sadly…yes, my entire comment was gone. 

Super frustrating experience…I want my 20 minutes back!",1
2018-11-21 17:37:46,“Connect” automatically without an option to leave a note in the app,"I had to use Safari browser to find a person then connect, to have an option to leave a note and not leave a note.

SHAME ON YOU LINKEDIN what a disgrace. All these fake companies that you can’t even find on glassdoor or anywhere else. You would think with all this technology that you could be able to filter out the fake companies but I guess your “developers” aren’t that smart anyways. What a joke of an app.",1
2018-01-14 17:09:09,Over sharing,"Not sure why, but this app, compared to any other social media app I’ve used, is way to easy to accidentally bump the share button on every and any post.

Instead they refunded back to my card and told me to simply buy the plan again

When I went to buy the plan again. I found the price was over $500!   

Went back and forth with customer service who ultimately recommended a purchase a different plan that was closer to what I was paying all these years.

Huh?!

I have decided to now be a free customer.  LinkedIn could have easily fixed my error by accepting my payment.    They chose not to do that and tried to put me the same plan for more than 2X the cost

You’re probably keenly aware of this yet you won’t fix it because you’re trying to get users to engage in the desktop version.

Ui freezing is not something that an app like LinkedIn should have much less for months on end. If I scroll through 50 results the ui will freeze during scrolling maybe 5 times.

2023-07-17 02:17:37,Premium scam,I use this app a lot and have for years. I recently signed up for premium but after a months found the $40 price to not be worth it. It says it’s “easy to cancel subscription” and “cancel anytime.” You can’t cancel without going onto a desktop!

Now I’m going through the same run around where no one uses common sense and they act like their security is protecting me by not giving me access to my contacts and information. My guess is people working here have the same attitude that I have about the company…and that’s why I can’t get this basic issue resolved. Going on 5 days with the same automated responses from some 20 year old process and system.,1

2022-05-05 02:25:07,Terrible App Support,"I have used LinkedIn since it was formed. The app is worthless and limited. The company changes an outrageous price for their site. It is becoming just another Facebook. They remove posts and limit companies posting. All my posts are missing from my company page, and three weeks later, a ticket is still one with no reply. Sad these companies get so big they lose touch with how they are here. Us posting and using their site. Guess time to go back to Facebook. At least there, the app works, and the company pages work.",1
2021-06-05 21:27:06,Awful,"I thought LinkedIn was a platform where intelligent minds meet. For them to censor content backed by scientific inquiry, research and real life findings because they want to control what you may read and think about a subject is utterly disgraceful. Any censorship of science and we are back to the dark ages where so much knowledge was lots at the hands of the Church all in the name of control. How are we there again? Shocking disregard for the truth, scientific process and human right to freedom of speech. If I could give zero, I would. Alas, I have to give the one star they do not deserve in order to write a review!",1
2021-01-09 23:02:45,Not Very Professional,"This platform has seriously devolved in the last couple of years becoming little more than a sounding board for Trump supporters. As a job seeker, your only recourse is to look away because if you post a comment pointing out a false claim, it may reflect badly to a future employer. While there is a feature to report it, I’m certain they don’t actually check (example: I’m pretty sure it’s common knowledge that Trump did not end human trafficking, but LinkIn thought it was ok). Also, not having the ability to selectively not see everyone in your networks activity, is furthering the conflicts.",1

2018-02-10 13:03:15,Good overall but some key features missing,"I love LinkedIn's networking features and how it helps with professional development, but there are a few critical pieces missing from the app. For example, on the app there isn't a Save button when you're adding or editing work experience, which is extremely inconvenient for someone like me who accesses my social media accounts via mobile 99% of the time. Please fix this issue and I will gladly change my review to a 5",3
2019-06-25 20:04:09,Unappealing New UX,"It looked better with the profile picture in the center. It used to look more centered and professional, but now it just looks like it’s trying to be like Facebook..? It’s very unappealing as a professional networking app. It doesn’t look symmetrical, and it puts more emphasis on the cover picture. It just looks off with the company name below the profile picture and the school name beside it while all being left-aligned. Most people don’t have cover pictures, so I don’t understand why even bother making the focus on that? It makes me not want to use it. I wish I didn’t update.",1
2019-06-14 18:59:40,They will steal your money,I was prompted to try the premium subscription for free for a month which I did. I did not give them any of my financial information. I figured that if I liked the services provided by the premium then I would pay to start using it. There were no benefits to the premium and it didn’t help me at all in my career search. Somehow they accessed my bank information and took their ridiculous amount out. When I tried to get a refund they gave me the run around for hours before they all around denied my refund. Awful customer service. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone.,1

Cannot recommend this ""tool"" which offers no advantage to a real person, with clear and present preferential treatment given only to fraudsters and the unwary.

In the unlikely event an actual person responds to me and has addressed my main issue -- that I am retired in a different locale than I my three decades of work! -- I will happily revise this conclusion.",1

However, as soon as I messaged someone it stated I was “out of mail credits” which is absurd because I’d JUST paid for it. Considering how expensive the premium is, nothing should be limited. I’ve deactivated my premium since. I refuse to waste money on limitations. Otherwise, a decent app when you’re not looking for much.",3
2017-12-07 18:10:42,LinkedIn Premium,"A few weeks ago I received an email from LinkedIn. In summary it offered a free month trial of the Premium subscription. I thought about it for a minute and accepted. Yet, I missed the little gray print that warned that the subscription would be charged if not cancelled before the trial ends. My mistake. 
However, my point is that LinkedIn did not send a warning note to remind that the trial was about to end and a decision had to be made. Instead, they sneaked the charge through ITunes. Who would have thought! For a company that proselytize on business etiquette and correctness this is plainly hypocritical.",1

I’m a vet tech. Not a “technician” for anything else. I’m not a waiter, a cashier, I’ve never worked in fast food…yet I keep seeing completely UNRELATED crap in my search. Indeed is way better.",2
2022-10-21 01:00:55,App fully refreshes anytime you leave it,"This app does a pretty terrible job of caching data in RAM. Whether I’ve got one app open or ten this app rarely fails to fully reload back on the home feed every time I leave the app.

I’ve used this for over 2 years with not 1 not 1 job interview. Not one call back. Just more social media junk. More political b.s.  I can bet Linkdin and indeed are the same platform.

The fact that I get messages from your platform giving me tips and there’s no way to opt out is aggravating, and then notifying my when you found someone I might know?

For example, random LinkedIn users that I declined connecting with can still see my posts, they can see the identities of members that have commented on my posts. There is no way to stop strangers commenting on your posts. I experienced someone posting profane comments on my post, exposed to all of my business contacts. The only solution was to delete my posts. LinkedIn has jumped the shark. Avoid.",1

When I tried to update it stays Open (does not let me update), I select Open to go into the App, and it prompts me to update without letting me use the app, and the cycle repeats.  Basically the latest update broke the app and I cannot use it anymore.  I understand that LinkedIn (Microsoft) is always looking to enhance and improve the app, but it should not include breaking backwards compatibility and if the plan to discontinue support for a certain version of iOS - it should be clearly communicated to the user...",1
2018-07-27 15:02:50,Okay but getting worse,This app doesn’t give you the option to hide and stop the message options that keeps popping up in messaging after you send a message. Also messaging doesn’t let you delete messages before their sent and after their sent. There needs to be a way to tell if they have read the message that was sent or if it’s still been unread. Also messaging doesn’t let you delete messages. LinkedIn needs to add all of these features to the LinkedIn app to really make it more useful and a lot easier and better and useful to use.,1

No matter where I am, majority of the time I get a blank page that says refresh at the top. No matter how many times I refresh nothing comes up. And it doesn’t matter if I have great service and WiFi the app rarely works. I’ve also tried deleting it a few times and reinstalling (because I wasn’t sure what else to do) and not even that worked. Very disappointed. Feel like we should be past broken apps these days",1

Then when you use the app they refuse to let you change the settings and say you must use the app. They also recently suffered a massive database breach. 96% off users data was compromised. They didn’t even bother telling their users about it. Instead they claim no passwords were stolen, it’s not a big deal that your name, personal information, contact information, and any other data you have given them.",1

LinkedIn website sends me to Apple. Which doesn’t give me the option to cancel. Unsure how to actually speak or reach customer service, Reach out to Apple who can’t help but I must use them to cancel. Now I am stuck with a feature that is helpful but not necessary. At 1 point it turned job searching off because I didn’t respond to the borderline “spam” offers I received. Never go premium complete waste that probably won’t help you get a job.",1
2018-04-16 01:09:16,Searching Contacts,Love the app and use it quite often.  Would like to see one major improvement to the contact management section of the mobile app to improve in person networking.

Search your contacts on the mobile app by that specific location and meet up in person.,3
2023-07-07 13:25:43,Was Great until the last update,"UPDATE: the job search algorithm still hasn’t been fixed. 

The job search on this app was decent until the last update. I check the job boards for a specific career everyday. Yesterday when I checked there were over 200 new jobs posted and none of them had anything to do with the type of job I search for. What ever they did in the update screwed up the search algorithm. I hope they fix it.",2
2023-03-20 01:33:02,Quality service but Premium with Ads is Sad,"I tend to think of and use LinkedIN as a professional version of Facebook.  With that in mind, it's an excellent resource for quality information.  In the past, I've had a premium subscription but I'm put off by the fact it doesn't include ad-free browsing and hence my feed is is still littered with ads.",4

Like the jobs have to be more specific and detailed than just the titles.",3
2021-04-27 16:19:51,Annoying Badged Notifications,"This is a great app, but the badge notifications are annoying. I cannot figure out how to disable them. Every day I have to click the app once to reset the red badges notification from 1 → 0.

The badge number is meaningless. I think LinkedIn is being deceptive and arbitrarily adding 1 badge notification every day. I know how to disable all badge notifications for LinkedIn, but I don’t want to since there are other important notifications I want to see.",2
2020-08-04 19:55:10,Please fix IPad Bugs!!!!,Great app for professional online networking! Bots and recruiters are starting to run the show unfortunately. The main reason for my review is the crazy amount of bugs for IPad users. The main one that is the most annoying is when I message people i cant click to exit out of the message and i have to close the app and restart it just to send another message. I restarted my iPad as well this isn’t on my end. Brand new iPad by the way.,3
2019-05-31 15:48:18,Poor customer support / account management,"Ok admittedly this is evidence of indecision on my part, but if you cancel and then renew your Premium subscription you lose all your InMail messages and the support agent will not restore them. 

The account management web pages for premium seem poorly done. There is not much clarity around what you can or cannot keep throughout the end of your billing period. They make it very easy to lose InMail messages that you paid them a significant amount of cash for. The combination of arbitrary limits and restrictions with poor transparency makes it feel like a swindle.",1
2018-11-05 22:05:28,Miserable user experience,"This app has essentially turned into a virus.

I need to swipe through about 20 pages of stuff I don’t want to see in order to actually begin using it. You know how when you first download an app, you get a walkthrough of the features? LinkedIn does that every single time you open the app, and there’s no way to skip over it. 

In short, it’s an absolutely miserable user experience, and I’m guessing it had to do with the fact that Microsoft now owns it. You know, the ones who forced you to download an operating system that pushes ads onto your desktop.",1
2018-09-25 20:52:36,Link not working,"I have come to rely on linkedin for my job search. And I just changed and saved the link to my profile so hiring companies and  others in my network can get to my site.

For the second time, I get a message as not being accessible which did not open up my page. This is disconcerting! What is the point of having linked in when you edit or update your link, and  success verification, only to end up not being accessible to others. 
Also, how about having a phone number for technical support? When I have specific questions, I do not have the time nor tolerance nor patience to do FAQs.
I can't get any problem resolved by a live support person in 1/4 the time I'd be going on a wild goose chase for answers!
So why is the link not working. It's the exact same link on my page as on my resume?",2

2023-08-15 14:06:57,LinkedIn Premium is far too expensive for recent grads.,I’ve been struggling to find work and got LinkedIn premium in order to assist the process and it’s way too expensive and suggests jobs that are no where near where you live. It seems like a huge waste of money and I’ll definitely be unsubscribing when I have a job but there needs to be some lower price point for recent grads just getting into the workforce. Pretty disappointed in this whole process.,2

Now it only functions on Wi-Fi. Phone and OS is up to date. I have scoured the web looking for solutions and none of them work.

2023-01-13 18:32:49,it’s really buggy lately,"I use both the iPad and iPhone apps many times a day. Normally, they work great. But not this week. 

I’m constantly engaging with connections. The messenger part of the app is super buggy right now. 

In the past week or so, I’m having constant problems. Messages don’t send or send twice, the app crashes multiple times in a session. The send button on the messages is blank. Messages take forever to open. 

Comments don’t always post. The app is crashing in the middle of me writing a comment. Sometimes I can’t tag people in comments. 

I tried to post today and add copy in the alt tag for an image. The app would not let me paste in content from my clipboard. 

This app is so essential to my daily workflow, I really hope developers fix these bugs soon.",2

My only complaint is that whenever I upload a profile picture it becomes extremely dark. All of the filters on LinkedIn make it worse. If someone can tell me how to fix this issue than this app would deserve all 5 stars.,4
2021-12-07 23:39:46,This company supports sexual harassment,Looks like my review was taken down so l’ll write it again. I reported comments that were sexually harassing a woman on LinkedIn and they refuse to take the comments down. The employees named Savio and Victoria personally ensured the comments stayed up. LinkedIn and its employees fully endorse and support sexual harassment and will go against their own safety guidelines to let it happen. If you are a woman they will not protect you so be wary signing up for this site. This is a factual review based on my experience. I will post it as much as I need to. I will NOT be silenced,1

I’m left to suffer through using the website which also doesn’t properly scale for a 10.5”+ screen.

LinkedIn has become a spam-ridden, relatively useless job board app, even with a Premium subscription. It’s trying to be a social platform and job board at the same time, but ultimately has become just another channel to generate ad revenue.

2023-03-30 14:25:28,Premium: LinkedIn is caching really bad,"I don’t think anyone can maximize the use of Premium Account if the application is caching.

2019-01-02 18:59:17,Horrible,"DO NOT UPDATE!!  The most recent update for the phone app must have been lead by monkeys. Apps are all about convenience, this update is nothing but inconvenient. The next update needs to be a rollback, but we know that will not happen.

The first paragraph must function like a splash page; it was there when I clicked to write a review, but it is the truth. 

IF YOU UPDATE, you will have lost the ability to click on a company page to see alumni from you schooling who work there and you no longer have the option to view all employees. 

Either LinkedIn is taking us all in a direction where nothing is free, or they enjoy shouting themselves in the foot and causing headaches for their developers. 

100% the alumni and employees need to be brought back for users to see.  I thought an update in September of 2015 was the worst, but this blows that version out of the water as the worst.",1

LinkedIn in mainly just a bunch of people trying to sell you their services and a place for people to stroke their own egos.

In mail messaging is a joke. If it’s not someone trying to sell you something then it’s someone or a bot asking you a question and when you respond, they don’t bother to interact. A huge waste of time. What a joke.",1
2022-01-09 14:51:17,a “Free 1 Month Trial” isn’t free when you charge me!!,I love linkedin as an App and have really seen some benefits from using this App but it is very frustrating that when I wanted to check out Linkedin learning there was a page that told me I could try premium to get courses for free with a free 1 month trial. I then checked my bank account and found out I was charged the full amount even thought I was told it would be free. This is very frustrating and is not fair to advertise that on the app and make customers pay.,1
2020-09-06 07:40:44,Refreshing,"I like this app overall. Everything flows pretty smoothly and I appreciate the new updates and features for business pages. I really rate this app at a 2.5 because it causes me to miss out on a lot of good content and opportunities to connect. From what I’ve seen and googled, there’s no option to refresh the app and put most recent content in order. I’m tired of seeing the same group of postings from weeks ago on my timeline.",3
2020-11-10 21:40:17,I don’t like this site,"I do not like LinkedIn, I think it’s just as bad as Facebook. It spams me with pages that I don’t want to see and won’t let me block them. It lets me “report abuse”, but won’t let me hide a page that it wants to force on me. The UI has gotten better over the years, but I still really dislike the platform as a whole. I don’t follow any pages, i just have connections. It’s constantly pushing things that my connections “like” on me and won’t allow me to stop it. I want a professional platform, not a propaganda machine.",1
2018-10-31 18:42:51,Zero Customer Service,"So there is this crazy thing called changing phone numbers. If you do that before changing it in LinkedIn, then be ready to be locked out of your account forever... because of the two-step verification process, and the inability to actually call this company’s customer service... oh and if you want to contact them via the forum... guess what... you have to sign in... via the two-step verification process! Hahahahahahahahahahah! So yeah, I’m locked out of my account permanently without any hope of actually calling someone to sort it out. 🤣👍",1
2021-01-15 22:06:04,Useful App and Website but I have a Suggestion!,"I have found LinkedIn to be very useful, especially as a college student. I would love a scheduled send feature though, like users would have for emails. Sometimes I go on LinkedIn after 5pm, and if we could schedule messages to be sent the following morning or whenever we choose, it would be really useful. 

 Thank you!",4

Every time I open it it tells me to confirm my email even though I’ve done that at least 3 times already, it tells me to add skills and when I do it can’t save them. Even when trying to apply to a job the app can’t scroll down on the screen. It’s worth it to have the app if you’re looking for jobs but c’mon app developers...step it up this is ridiculous.",3

I get that they have promoted jobs, but if I’m not interested in them it’s a waste of good WiFi.

2019-01-02 21:09:36,Poorly designed app,"I wish this app was not a professional necessity, but it is. That means that you’re stuck using something a little bit better than the mess of a website that LinkedIn has, but not by much.

2022-12-07 12:18:36,Lots of potential,"It’s a great app because it makes you aware of what you could do if it had some more features like Instagram. It’s great to see professional people you can connect to, but the Feed feature likes to refresh on its own at every opportunity, so you might experience discontinuity if you had to switch apps or turn your iPhone sideways. It could be a great social app.",3
2018-06-14 02:06:29,LinkedIn charges for free trials,I was offered a free trial but when I hit the button I was immediately charged.  This caused an overdraft on my account.  LinkedIn was unhelpful and took hours to get responses from.  I had to call Apple support to get my refund and no one was able to refund my overdraft fee.  LinkedIn’s only solution to make this right was to offer me the same free trial they charged me for the first time.  I used LinkedIn for years and just got fed up with their lack of support including the fact they have no number you can call for help.  I would not recommend this app,1
2018-04-25 19:54:01,New update needs an update,I recently updated the app and have been unable to use it ever since. It continually says I have no Internet connection and it doesn’t allow me to login though I do have connection and Am logged in through my web browser. The app insists that I have no Internet. I have deleted and re-downloaded it four times now and I’ve given up.

2023-08-27 21:06:47,Decent for social networking - use caution though,"I like the app for use in networking and growing professionally. However, I find it concerning to see people posting books for “free” when they are not the author. The reporting process is worse than most too since they require filing legal paperwork. Maybe don’t require your users to file  paperwork for your company. This should be a moderator’s job, not ours. This app will be getting 2* until this problem is fixed.",2

Many times I have to restart the phone just to be able to click on the linked in notification to open the app. If I swipe to delete a notification that I've already read, it's erratic and mostly just opens my camera app. It's so bad that I'm thinking of taking the app out of notifications because it's sooo annoying.",2
2020-04-10 21:50:41,Clunky App,"I used this app years ago and just resumed after a long break (~8 years). I'm not impressed with the current iteration. When browsing suggested profiles, the app freezes whenever I click on one. I can't find a back button or any gesture that returns me to the gallery view. I have to close out the app and come back. 

I'm also not loving the way my feed displays, but maybe I haven't found a magic setting yet? I want all new posts to appear first. 

Next issue—the ad bloat is pretty awful, but I guess this is just a reflection of the internet in 2020. 

Finally, I get really annoyed when I see copy/paste responses to reviews. I'd rather they ignore them than write the same vapid ""we'll certainly pass your concern on to our team blah blah blah.""",3

Some companies tell me no after a year of applying or that they decided not to hire. Corporate America is about who you know and not what you know. There is no app to help you with that.,1

You can’t openly talk about how you operate your linkedin or anything regarding hiring people to help you with messaging or anything related to that.

Why am I seeing posts from 1 month ago above posts from 3 days ago???? I don’t want/need LinkedIn or other apps to tell me what’s more important for me to see first. Users should have an option to decide for themselves. Please make this update and I would use LinkedIn much more.,3
2018-12-01 21:34:57,Frustrating user experience,"Frustrations abound compared to the browser version:

- I can’t for the life of me figure out how to sort the news feed by recent.
- Assuming my last point is intentional, the sorting by top is all stuff that is weeks old vs the same sort on the desktop version. Deleting the app, etc doesn’t seem to address this nor is that a reasonable solution. 
- The header left and right menu/controls seem non-intuitive also. I don’t like to ha e to hunt and hunt for reasonable features like sorting my feed but find totally useless and never used features behind every click I try. 

Please consider addressing at least the first issue. I despise sorting by top and don’t want LinkedIn to keep insisting this upon me in mobile and reverting my selection of sort by recent on mobile.",2

Some improvements have been made to increase the fluidity of the experience, but so many details are left behind. 

Just for fun, try to figure out where your ‘saved items’ are, or try to update your banner or any profile settings on mobile. 

You might say “oh but Katie, you can make those changes on a desktop even though you can’t make them on mobile, so the options are still available” 

Wrong. 

Even if i update a banner on my desktop, it shows nothing on the mobile app. But it still populates in the mobile browser????

2019-11-02 15:38:34,Scam,"It is a shame that LinkedIn would scam out students.
I’m a college student, and have a profile with LinkedIn. LinkedIn started sending me promotion to upgrade my account to premium which is WORTHLESS. 
Regardless, I though I would give it a try since the first month was free. Well, the last week of that month I had a surgery and couldn’t cancel my membership of $64 and they charged me. The day after, when I saw the charge, I contacted LinkedIn to try to solve this issue because as I mentioned, I am a college student and couldn’t afford, and now even less because of the surgery. 
They only offered me to cancel my subscription for future payments, but no refund whatsoever. 

$64 for a service I didn’t get a 1 single benefit is SCAM but more than that, not being able to refund the fee 1 day after payment, not understanding the situation of a student is cruel.",1
2019-07-22 12:53:00,Payment for basic search function,"LinkedIn has set a number of people you are allowed to search per month. The number is not told to you and you are not warned about said limit. You will be told you have maxed out and can pay for more views with commercial access - premium will not cover this basic search functionality. When asked, LinkedIn will not provide the limit and a warning will only be given once limit has been reached. Major scam for basic functionality.",1

The other day I unsubscribed to a bunch of emails from them and I was still getting them. I don't think this is just an app issue, and I think it's a feature and not a bug. This really needs to end.

I’d be ready to pay a small regular fee for an ad-free experience.
I’d be ready to spend a little time optimizing some filters in order to at least avoid irrelevant ads, like it works on FaceBook.

They decided not to charge me for July until August so you can imagine the shock when I saw $60 worth of charges from iTunes in my billing statement. Upon calling Apple and having their amazing CSRs walk me through to check everything I found that LinkedIn decided to wait to bill me for July in August.

Then, a week later I topped up my balance and immediately lost part of the money. And yet the customer service says I won't even have 30 days of Premium access from that date.

They neither gave me an option to refund, nor a full month of access. This is unfair and absoutely frustrating.",1

I also loathe having to scroll back up a little bit to make the x reappear. Is it just me or am I doing it wrong?,4

2017-12-20 21:00:54,Ok app with stale information,"The app works ok for the notifications and messaging. However the news feed is worthless. Why would anyone want to look at articles that are 5 or 10 days old? Where is the option to see the most recent information? 

Other problems. This is not an entertainment platform, this is not Facebook. Why are we being asked to like birthdays and other non-professional items? Why are people posting non business related pictures and articles?",1

I reported this to the app and they said that this bad behavior of contacting people to sell goods and services is within the policies.

UPDATE:
1. Don’t patronize me. I didn’t bring this to your attention. LinkedIn, TikTok and others are getting roasted in the press over this form of privacy intrusion.
2. Quoting Erran Berger’s party line response is BS. Vague enough to quiet the mob but totally disingenuous.
3. Given that LI has a history of sneakily stealing contact addresses, you have zero credibility.

Why would LinkedIn need to perform an “equality check” when the app is not in the foreground? Huh? Why perform an equality check PERIOD? If a user doesn’t paste a clipboard item, why validate that the clipboard is equal to inputted text?

This is grounds for a nice juicy class action suit.",1

2. LinkedIn has become more Facebook-y

LinkedIn used to have some level of professional demeanor on its feed. Now my feed is filled with “I am oh so honored to be using the toilet at the Bank of America Building and beginning this new chapter of my life”.

2023-04-20 23:07:12,Something real classist/elitist about this platform,"Why is this advertised as a great way to network and find new opportunity?

This platform only cares about appearance and not about actual skills. It only resulted in one actual job that was as a measly barista/server for a very mean and racist company.

Everyone just wants to be successful why there have to be so many barriers and obstacles for people who are so called “different”?",2

Currently, if you aren’t using the latest app version, this app will force you to select “update” or “not now” constantly. It doesn’t save your selection and prompts every single time you switch back to the app. This is not only happening after closing the app and reopening—it will actually prompt when simply switching apps.

Like posting and reposting doesn’t work.

They try to force you to have by using “stories” as a app only function. No one really looks at stories.

This app unnecessarily collect and stores picture.

It’s not like anyone is profiting off of it besides you and you’re using your customers ina reproachable manner especially during COVID is reprehensible. It is just not cool at all!

How could so many STILL put an emphasis on resume production in the wake of this, let alone allow her to have active status?

The thing with the iOS features now that I am locked out you made it hard for my classmate to work with my cousin.  Really?!?",1

My top five are all greater than a week old.  Just absolutely completely useless.  I want to see what’s new NOW.  Not some post from 2 weeks ago I’ve already seen.  Pathetic.

I decided to try replacing my laptop with a tablet for the summer.  I discovered that the jobs profile page won’t update, and gives a useless error.  After repeated attempts I had to fall back to the web site.

Apps with features that don’t work, or don’t work right, are frustrating.  Especially when you trust that the updates you made have actually been made.  It was not obvious, either, that the updates had not ‘taken’, even though no error was received at the end.

When features don’t work in an app it is an embarrassment to the company, a sign of poor software development practices, and insufficient testing.",1
2018-12-16 04:44:08,Please solve this issue,"I don't know whats wrong with the app because it get stuck and then not responding even though that i have the last version of the app .

2018-07-02 14:22:36,The news feed is garbage,"I’m constantly seeing posts and articles and ads I’ve seen a dozen times or more. I shouldn’t be seeing posts that are 2 weeks old, talking about things that have since passed. Hiding annoying, repetitive ads does nothing to change the feed either, so you’re stuck looking at the same ad until LinkedIn moves on. LinkedIn itself is great but its app is terrible.",2
2017-12-12 14:48:04,Ruined by tabloid trash.,"Was a good app until LinkedIn ruined it by adding top stories/ trending that you cannot disable. Last thing I want from a professional app is depressing news of human stupidity. Let us disable it. You are not Facebook. Let me decide what's good for me.
Update Nice form letter from a ""developer"". Bot  Almost as bad as saying that ""your call is very important to us. Please hold"" sooo no plans to give me an option to disable ur click bait trash.",2
2017-11-22 02:36:12,Strictly Business,I love using this app to connect with people in my local business community and also with those whom have the same career interests as I do. User friendly and look forward to some future updates,5
2023-10-21 21:38:14,Can’t see what your typing,"Whenever I try to type anything, the app itself always scrolls up so I can’t see what I’m typing. If I scroll up to try to see what I’m typing, my keyboard goes away, when I try to type again, it scrolls up so far you can’t see anything you type. Doesn’t happen on the website so maybe it’s time to call it quits on this app.",2
2023-09-07 21:54:52,Buggy,"App is extremely bugged, it constantly freezes and needs restarting every time I use it. When I try to apply more than one filter in the search, it completely resets.

2023-07-24 06:05:13,App continues to stink,I really like LinkedIn on the pc but the app continues to stink. It’s been a while since I used to app but it locked up twice today when I when to look at my profile. In the past it was horrible trying to post pictures. I gave up on that long time ago and use the pc only.,3
2023-01-14 14:10:06,Best job search/apply platform,"You only need Linkedin to find and get any job you want. All centralized there. No need for any other platform, gotten all my jobs thru there including a FAANG. 
It’s your online resume!!",5
2023-06-11 20:18:05,Timeline in need of a major overhaul.,Please fix the timeline feed in the mobile app! It’s been years that the timeline lack the ability to be able to be adjusted and I continue to see posts that are weeks and months old featured in my timeline. I should have the ability to make adjustments and see what I feel is relevant as opposed to having the app make the decision.,2
2023-05-31 19:55:35,Waste of time,The fact that I had to sign up for a free trial just to message someone but I’m still unable to because I have to complete five different steps is ridiculous. All I needed to do was get into contact with one individual. I shouldn’t have to go through a whole marathon of steps and different things just to get two credits so I canceled my subscription service and I’m deleting the app. Thanks for the waste of time.,1
2023-02-25 01:51:45,Slow,"Ever since I started my LinkedIn Premium free trial, both the app on my phone and the website on my computer have been incredibly slow. It takes five minutes to load a page and in the end it fails to load. I tried submitting an online ticket regarding this issue but even that didn’t work because the website is so slow, using LinkedIn has become agonizing lately.",1
2022-06-03 13:58:30,Issues since I upgraded to iPhone 13,"Ever since I’ve upgraded my phone to the iPhone 13, the app doesn’t load and I’m prompted to try again later or retry. I’ve updated all the updates and restarted multiple times. Sometimes the app doesn’t load with WiFi capability. Very frustrating.",3
2019-12-20 00:15:38,Sometimes works,The app mostly works but sometimes there are issues. I know ios13 is buggy but they should have a whole team working on making this app as good as possible. I tried uploading my user profile image from the app and after several attempts had to go to the mobile web version of the app.,3
2022-04-15 22:16:23,Absolute hot garbage,"The search engine is absolutely terrible (searching for ‘animal control’ pulled up a bunch of manufacturering jobs) the recommended page is absolutely irrelevant and recommends jobs all the way across the country rather than near me or even in my state, the network page is essentially useless…basically only download LinkedIn if you’re looking for a Facebook thats slow, clunky, and has a horrendous UI.",1

It’s against community guidelines.",1
2020-12-24 13:52:10,Crashes every time since the last update,"I enjoy reading professional articles that I find on the app. However, since the last update, the app crashed almost every time. Didn't take much for the app to crash: I just scroll down, the app freezes for several seconds, then it crashes. This makes the app useless, and I hope the developer team fixes it soon.",2
2020-05-22 14:05:36,Not even worthy of one star,"This app is horrible.  I literally had to pass through three security steps to log in each and every time no matter what I did to change my settings.  This was one huge headache and I agree with other users that the interface is inadequately designed, with alerts that are difficult to manage.  Do yourself a favor and use a different app for networking to remove a lot of stress from your job search!",1
2019-05-29 05:12:29,Cannot update language in app,I have been using LinkedIn for years and I love the strong functions for job searching and connecting. But I don’t know why I cannot update the language in the app... whenever I write my info in English it still appears to be Chinese.. I hope this could be solved,4
2017-10-21 08:19:45,Can make it better,"This app is good, can be made better by making it ‘real’ to the core.
In my opinion people use this app more for personal gains than making overall enrichment, uplifting professional standards. 
I do feel that the app keeps on changing on regular basis and try to improve constantly.",4
2019-05-24 17:43:20,Auto renews premium for $60,I kept getting pop ups telling me to do the LinkedIn premium trial and I clicked it just to get it to stop since it was free. Repeatedly tried to cancel the subscription and the app kept producing an error instead of taking me to my subscriptions. I ended up going through apple after I was charged $60 to renew for features I did not even use. They don’t give refunds and don’t seem to have any customer service number to contact. Terrible.,1

However, I cannot increase the font or use the magnifier when using or trying to use the app on iPad. This app is NOT accessible friendly for me.

2018-06-22 17:08:33,Want to manage my company page,"With companies doing more on LinkedIn it is surprising that I can’t post things to the corporate page from a Mobil platform.

Add that, you go to 5 stars.",3

I try to update and get a “no internet connection” error message. I have to close and open the app SEVERAL times to get it to update. Makes me less likely to use the app.",3
2017-12-14 11:53:44,Getting back in the job market,I have been with one of the leading banking industry for 30 years and never tried to look into other fields or industries to brighten my career. LinkedIn gave me the intuition and drive to search at what else is out there for my career interests.,5

2023-07-23 19:17:29,They’ll take your money and lock you out,"I was in the job market and (foolishly) paid for Indeed premium. They locked me out for unspecified reasons… I think because the first name I use in daily life doesn’t *exactly* match the government-issued ID I use, but that seems pretty common? Anyway, hard to say since they also won’t communicate with me, but I can say for sure that any money spent on the “Premium Career” version of this app is money wasted.",1

2023-04-23 20:09:27,Invasive and filled with bots,"Why LinkedIn needs a “feed” I’ll never know. Either way it uses invasive means to populate it with ads and stories.

The worst part of the ap is it’s fake job postings that could be easily screened out. Instead LinkedIn goes out of its way to put them first for the people most likely to apply to them. The result is false hope and a needlessly long job search while you struggle to even pay your bills.",1

2022-11-05 15:31:43,Algorithmic Catastrophe,Meta’s mobile application for Linkedin almost mirrors Facebook in almost every terrible way - where the algorithm’s recommended posts show things you have already seen and continue to see for a week or more. The amount of suggested content and lack of relevancy is overwhelming. All culminating in a horrendous waste of time and siloing echo chambers instead of enabling professionals to connect and share thoughts to the network holistically.,1

2021-05-20 13:06:15,Pronouns Not Showing Up,Colleagues have recently mentioned LinkedIn add the capability to add pronouns on your profile. I haven’t been able to find this setting via the app or desktop website. Is this feature still being rolled out?,4
2022-04-12 12:19:52,Another social network with spam,"Recently I reported posts that were spamming a local professional networking group and the official response was that the posts were not against LinkedIn policies.

To make matters worse, it was not intuitive to leave the group.  Come on LinkedIn.  Do better.",2
2022-03-19 18:16:19,Great,This app is so easy to use and user friendly. Only negative is that it feels a little too focused on being a social network. But overall it’s just a ton faster and cleaner than indeed or handshake,5

2021-01-11 19:12:15,Censorship,LinkedIn is a powerful business tool. I have used it very successfully to expand my network. BUT they have a tendency to restrict your account with no warning meaning that you have no access to the massive amount of connections and data on the platform. There is NO ONE to talk to when that happens. You are totally at their mercy. You get no warning beforehand either. So definitely keep all important contact information in your own files.,1
2020-09-19 14:16:24,Search History Disappeared,"It used to be really convenient as the job section would maintain like 10 recent searches. Now, that option is gone and it only gives three when you click on the search bar. It was much easier and convenient when the current history was available above the recommended job section. Really disappointed.",1
2020-06-28 21:43:40,No benefit at all from this service,"First the service is just a place for people to talk but not find true solutions to the ridiculous circus that recruiting and applying has become! don't waste your money!

The software training classes do offer benefits (when the trainer doesn't mess up and misstate things)- but we need that as a separate LinkedIn module all together! and free during Covid would be more reasonable and respectful of the Gates' during this difficult time for millions of Americans!",1
2019-12-20 15:37:18,Updates?,"Like it, but would it be possible to add some fundamental app features like the ability provide feedback or bug reports in-app?

- some ineffective process is running somewhere. While just browsing jobs my phone gets super hot. What is happening?

2022-11-11 22:42:05,Extremely Slow,The app is so slow to load menu changes and whatnot—so slow that it’s genuinely egregious… In this day & age especially; truly laughable.

2021-04-29 20:59:28,Stop sending me useless notifications,No matter what I do the app constantly will show a red 1 for a notification even if I’ve turned everything off.

2020-12-13 05:07:04,Rollback your update or fix it,Come on LinkedIn you need to do better. The app makes me login every time I open it and sometimes it even logs me out while I’m using it.

2019-08-16 03:47:39,Doesn’t follow modern app standards,I’m constantly confused as to why there aren’t more swipe gestures implemented in this app. I’d really like to be able to dismiss profile previews by swiping down. I also don’t want the connection request confirmation to show at the top of the screen with no way to dismiss. Navigation needs a lot of updating to conform to modern standards.,3

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve received important responses to my messages without any notification at all.

This is critical because it states that you must cancel the subscription a day before the free trial ends. So cancel at any time does not help you with a refund. And if you want a refund you cannot request a refund on the app and you must login on a desktop. Really?",1
2022-10-28 14:18:58,Garbage feed algorithm,"LinkedIn should be a useful website. But the inability to customize one’s Feed — driven, I suspect, by a desire to push advertising — means that I either have to scroll through a garbage algorithm that serves me weeks-old content or switch to most recent and scroll through every single one of my connections’ little emoji reactions and comments. Let us customize what types of posts we see in your feed.",1

2021-09-09 21:12:05,ios version support,"The ridiculous fact is some phones now don’t support highest ios update versions. And with each update, the apple makes iPhone run much much slower than before so that you’d have to buy newer phones from them!
And considering all these, the developers of linkedin still decide to publish updates which only supports ios 13.
Making every single older phone or everyone who don’t want to install ios updates, unable to use the app for good.

i believe this is serious criticism for the devs to face, and i hope they reconsider the policy into a right one.

The obvious counter to that is ""then you wouldn't scroll through all our sponsored ads"". Which leads to my next issue...

2019-05-07 17:24:17,Want to Upload All Your Contacts???,"The LinkedIn app is a minefield of prompts to upload all your contacts. Sorry, but I don’t want to see what my exes, telemarketers and all the other contacts in my phone are up to. Today I opened the app to connect with someone and was promoted twice, in two different ways, to upload all my contacts. There’s no way to turn it off and it’s really annoying.

If it weren’t for that, I’d give the app 4 or 5 stars.",1
2018-04-30 20:40:18,Can’t attach a file,It’s kind of ridiculous that I can’t attach a file at all in the messages. It only gives me the option for photos and to mention other LinkedIn users. Then when I try to go to the site on safari because I can actually send files on the desktop site it just directs me to the app. I have literally use the hotspot on my phone to then connect my laptop so I can send a resume. Great website awful app!!,1
2018-04-24 20:26:45,Beware!!!!!,"After a long hiatus from this App I reloaded it and updated my account.

After allowing LinkedIn to share my information (hoping to find a new job in my field) I have been getting 6-10 robocalls a day from shady companies not even close to my field. One even was trying to claim I had debt with him (outright lies)!

So if you want an unending stream of sales calls go ahead and let LinkedIn make money off you by selling your info to the highest bidder.",1
2023-07-28 14:27:29,App update idea,"Just a thought, LinkedIn could add a feature of like but not like exactly, but more like an option for cfbr instead of cfbr.. like you would react to the post but not like it, instead react for better reach kinda thing",4

2023-10-04 15:01:00,Premium is web only,"Giving this app only 2 stars because you cannot manage or even view your Premium subscription information from the app. It’ll tell you that it is optimized for Desktop but in reality is because LinkedIn doesn’t want to share any fees with Apple. Ok, so I’ll go CANCEL this overpriced membership on the web.",2
2022-09-30 23:23:06,Locked Out,The new security feature created some issues for a couple of days but between customer service and googling what to do I was able to login again.,4
2023-06-29 15:24:46,LinkedIn is the worst,I purchased a new phone and I wanted to log into my LinkedIn account but it keeps telling me that my account is suspended. I sent a message to LinkedIn to do an investigation they came back with it have suspended my account because of my activities and now I am unable to log in. The only thing I use the app for is to look for job and congratulations some of my friends.,1
2023-06-24 03:38:16,Does this app even work properly?!,"I have found that for awhile now I can’t seem to view my own profile. When I press on my icon a side menu slides out from the left. But non of the buttons work. I can’t access my own profile, pages, groups, events and settings.
Am I the only one!?
What is happening here?
Please fix. Thank you!",2
2022-10-27 21:44:18,Constant refreshing,"I could be midway through an application and need to get off of the screen for a second to get some information. When I come back, LinkedIn refreshes and I lose the application and basically everything. I’ve decided not to apply for jobs on LinkedIn anymore.. just use it to find out what jobs are hiring, then go directly to their career website.",1
2022-07-01 16:21:40,Version challenges,"When using the app or logging in from an iPhone does not allow me to publish articles. That’s frustrating because, like right now, I have one copied to my memory, and can’t post it to my community.

At least my FB network got a copy. Please fix so I can publish.",3
2022-09-13 18:18:57,Headline won’t save,"No matter how many times I try, the app will not save my headline that reflects my new employer! Keeps having a pop up that says “something went wrong. Please try again”. Both my current and former employers are not liking this. Who can fix this for me? The Help section just shows how it is supposed to work. Frustrated!!!",2
2022-09-04 13:18:07,Another Facebook,"They have taken away all the analytics in the last two months.  It is not even worth posting as you can only see 100 users information on a 40k post!  You can’t see people, employers, etc.  They charge premium for services they now have a work around!  They haven’t grown other than to be more like Facebook and as Serina would say I’m evolving away from LinkedIn!",1
2022-06-12 17:47:02,Updates all the timeeeeeee,There’s an update every other day and for what? That’s why it’s crashing on ppl. You open it and it says “something went wrong” and the only reason it’s doing that is becausssssse there’s an update. It would be nice if an update lasted longer than a week.,3
2021-07-06 03:15:24,Personalized invite is never an option,"Personalized invite is never an option on my phone, after networking with people, I feel guilty at being mannerless because I used the app to connect with that individual. I can invite only from laptop, not from the app.",3
2022-04-17 04:23:50,Finding saved content is a nightmare,It is entirely way too difficult to find saved posts (same is true in the web actually). Saved items should be accessible from the menu that appears when clicking on our profile photos.,2
2021-09-10 19:00:20,Don’t Force the Updates,"I have no problem if you want to send a reminder pop up that there’s an update available. However, when I click on a notification I don’t want to be stuck on a screen that forces me to update before I can do anything. This was not a convenient time for me to update. I should be able to update at my convenience not be forced into it.",1
2021-07-21 01:38:44,Bait & switch app,"Tried to reach out to a contact not in my contact list. In order to send them a message a pop-up window indicated I needed to download the LinkedIn app, which I then did. When I then tried to send them a message another pop up window came up and said I could only do it with their premium functionality for $59. This is a ridiculous app not worth your time or effort",1
2020-12-10 12:52:00,Constantly Logged Out,"The LinkedIn app provides me with the info needed on a daily basis to continually improve my career. However, whatever recent updates made now automatically sign me out in between sessions. This now happens up to 5 times a day.  Please fix this issue or provide instructions to prevent this from occurring ASAP.",3
2020-12-31 03:02:30,No value provided - harvests too much personal data,"Ready to delete because it is so manipulative and doesn’t help with anything. I only got this because of airBnB but otherwise it’s worthless. It tries to coerce you into opening it, downloading worthless updates. 

With the release of iOS 14, it is clear that LinkedIn is collecting way too much data. They don’t need this info to provide their so-called service. What a dishonest, disgusting organization.",1
2020-11-16 08:32:31,Business purpose; not Facebook,"Please do some content moderating.  Lately my feed looks like Facebook with posts about people’s political preference, happy anniversary to my wife, prayers, pictures of kids and pets.  No recipes yet, but I’m sure that’s next!  LinkedIn was a place for business, with business related posts.  Could we please get back to that?",3
2020-12-07 02:06:30,December IPhone App Performance Issues,It’s obvious that their are severe performance issues with the App since the most recent update including getting logged out repeatedly and App failing to load new content. Yet LinkedIn is not providing any useful communication to user community about how to resolve this or when it will be resolved. Very frustrating and App is virtually unusable. UAT on this update must have been non-existent. Better should be expected of Microsoft for sure.,1
2020-05-06 02:06:24,The banner does not show while using app,Working on this for quite a while with LinkedIn customer service. They are not able to fix it. I dont want to write everything down here. They already know. I really wish there was an alternative app which would let professionals and companies connect efficiently. Thanks.,2
2017-10-20 22:17:48,Limited app - can’t change certain settings,Why can’t you access settings in the app?  I took myself out of private mode with the app.  But there was no way to access settings to turn it back on.  I have to log on to the webpage to do that.  So stupid!,4
2020-03-24 18:31:25,Bad for job application,"I use the website when I’m on the computer and LinkedIn in fairly easy to use. However the app is totally different; while it caries over the information form my profile, when I attempt to apply to a posted job all the app does is go to an unrelated page and doesn’t allow you to app. The only work around is to save the job then get on the computer when you can to apply.",1
2020-03-08 17:30:19,Link !,You app is involved with harassing me bulling cursing and discrimination so I going turn you just like Mixer and Reddit and how the used your app and Microsoft’s products threaten my Family I’m going sue all of you ! Disrespectful to me and I’ll help anyone it’s sad your involvement with hackers !,5
2019-12-12 23:57:22,Rearranging Certifications,For some reason LinkedIn has taken away the users ability to rearrange their certifications. The way LinkedIn displays them may not always align with which certifications are the best/most useful/most relevant for a specific user. I feel like it should give you the option to decide which initial 3 are displayed.,3
2019-11-10 22:49:25,This app used to be good. It is the worst now.,"Pop ups all the time after every single action in the app. And annoying users by showing a pop up to buy linkedin premium every time after you “easy apply” for a job  is just cheap. If we wanted the premium, we would get the premium.

In my eyes, LinkedIn is literally trying to bully people into buying the premium by annoying users with the pop ups. Shame on you.",1
2019-06-01 21:49:22,Uploading Resume,"Before the update, you were able to upload your resume to your profile by the command to upload media. Now when you choose it (to upload it) it only allows you to do a photo. Does that mean I have to screenshot my resume? I used to be able to upload a Word doc.",3
2019-04-25 23:58:48,Videos & Images Don’t Load,"The last two updates have botched this app.  I can see images and videos for a split second while I’m scrolling, but as soon as I stop to watch a video it goes black.  If I open the post I just get a spinning wheel.  I know it’s not my WiFi or cellular connections.  Has to be the app.  I haven’t bothered opening other than to see if it’s corrected.  Not a real loss because LinkedIn is less about business now anyway.",1
2019-03-22 10:46:22,App freezes,"For such a big name you have the worst application I’ve ever seen, it has been so long and you guys haven’t fixed this issue. Every time i open the application it would freeze after scrolling couple of posts. It’s not like it happens once in a while, it would do the same all day long. 
If you guys don’t have efficient developers then use your own platform to find some one who can fix this issue.",1
2018-10-31 01:35:53,STOP with the Sponsored Inbox posts!!,"This app was okay but now it's taken a completely scummy turn! I noticed a notification in my inbox on LinkedIn and when I went to check I found it was a ""sponsored"" message. The message was some trash article I don't care about and in order to get rid of that notification I had to open the message and go in to delete t. Talk about a waste of time and an invasion of ads into my inbox, what a new low!!",1
2018-09-12 17:20:57,New Update?,"I’ve used Linkedin happily for awhile but as of a few days ago, its been quite glitchy. It keeps signing me out every so often, asking me to prove that I’m not a bot-both on my ipad and iphone. Another, some links aren’t responsive when clicked. 

It’s quite frustrating especially since there were times I had a lengthy note typed out, only to disappear after being signed out... Poor user experience. Please fix.",1
2018-06-07 13:41:14,Customer service,"You have created a fine product and successfully taken it to market through crowd funding but you have not supported your customers. This is not a good long term strategy. If you are unaware just look at any of you social media comments. I was a fan now I’m just another disappointed customer. 
Regard,",3
2018-03-26 12:51:35,Good function but annoying UI,"I am using an IPhone X and still find the top news, search bar, and share bar at the top annoying whenever I scroll up it pulls down blocking the top 25% of the screen. Also, some of the app utilized swipe to go back while other parts require hitting a back button. Small details, but the inconsistency is detracting from the content.",2
2018-01-10 22:34:11,Because it’s not professional,"I’m writing this review because Linkedin has started asking users to review their site internally and not show it to the public through the App Store. 

This mobile site is the more of a Facebook page then actually wanting to network with professionals.  I’m surprised I don’t have to watch a commercial before I access the site. The premium site is little to useless giving data that isn’t needed. Why don’t I have the same options on the mobile site as the desktop, how long has it been?

Stick to the basics. Show who is in your network. That’s it. Stop asking for my contacts and my Facebook. 

Thank you,

Brent",2
2017-12-15 03:47:11,Can't live without it.,Professional opportunities abound on LinkedIn. Having this app is critical to being notified immediately when they pop up so you're not responding days or week later.,5

2022-06-06 17:17:15,LinkedIn access,I have an iPhone 6S and am very satisfied with it. Linked in newest version requires 13.0 and my antique won’t accept that version. So when I open the app from my on screen icon I am asked to download this 13.0 but mine won’t I can’t access LinkedIn. I guess the only option I have is to delete linked in and explore other options.

2022-02-01 23:38:25,"Slow, crappy platform",The app is so glitchy and the filters don’t even work. I filtered on entry level jobs and was getting jobs for managers. It seems companies manipulate the filters and it’s not like you can report them accurately.

This issue becoming frustrating.

My phone is updated, the app is updated, yet the problem still exist.

Of course since I got and cancelled the trial via iTunes subscription, I can’t cancel my account. Any time I try I get to a page to cancel an already cancelled subscription.

2017-12-14 09:17:48,Happy medium,LinkedIn in my opinion is a more adult communications. Business but a area where creative knowledge is presented. Can be liberal in content. But restrained in personal pity stuff. Good balance. LinkedIn is evolving. With the spiritual surrounding of the earth. All kinds of info. Void of stupid commercials.,5
2017-11-17 23:43:14,Great app,"I use this app every day. Consider moving even more functionality from the full version to the app. Also, make search function results more intuitive.",5
2023-05-12 22:32:50,REVIEW,"LinkedIn is just the best App for Great Mind, Information, Knowledge and Connections.

2023-09-10 16:22:07,LinkedIn disabled the ‘Report this Ad’ function,"You can no longer report/block advertisements. How dou—-bag of them. 

LinkedIn ads are bad to start with. They just keep showing you the same ones over and over even if you did report them. But now when you tap the feature it freezes. 
Unprofessional, misleading and costly for advertisers and consumers",1
2023-08-24 20:42:01,Easy Apply = Hard Apply,"Worked on multiple open-ended questions in their Easy Apply portal.

After I finished, the portal had an error and deleted all my work. Furthermore, the job apparently wasn’t even open while LinkedIn’s UI said it was open.

2021-05-31 13:23:14,Bad Customer Service - Poor Story Quality,"LinkedIn The quality of the stories (images and videos) is terrible when they are posted. Unlike Instagram and Twitter, when you post a story, it looks just like you downloaded it in high quality.

2019-09-13 14:50:34,The app needs notes when connecting with people.,Adding notes when reaching out to a potential connection is a very important aspect of the LinkedIn website. My peers and I would like to see that added to the app as well.,4

This started recently and I’ve turned off all my notifications. Why is it so?",3
2020-04-06 12:20:55,Dissatisfied with the Premium subscription,Too disappointed using the premium services. Not helpful at all for job search. I was looking for a new job option and paid for at least more then 8 months for premium membership I feel it’s useless either the job posts I see so far no body either gives a response or I won’t even get a call back for any recruiters. It’s like gathering dust on shelves.,1
2019-12-21 07:20:37,Best Career App,Surprised at some of the low star ratings that exist.  LinkedIn has come a long way and makes managing your career communication and network not only easy but enjoyable. Keep doing what you’re doing. Thank you.,5

Gut a email from the Apple support. They asked me to go to an address that was not a link but one you had to enter in manually. For such a HIGH tech company they are still working in the dark ages. PLEASE TELL ME HOW I GET RID OF MY LINKEDIN ACCOUNT THIS IS A JOKE!!!!!",1

2019-06-26 13:10:05,Not Effective Platform,"These apps were so much better separated. First of all, the app doesn’t recognize any interests and won’t save them. Hence, my feed is NOTHING what I like.

2019-05-30 16:08:05,Useless and you can do without it,"Honestly my frustration is two fold:
First, the way LinkedIn forced this option made me uncomfortable. They offered a free trial then i went to explore my subscription with the intention to cancel it (it was already active but the free trail) it automatically charged $63 to my account!!!!
I don’t recall seeing a confirmation screen or payment authorization and of course apple refused to refund me.

Second, the premium option itself is of ZERO added value. I can still see who (from my connections viewed my profile) but not recruiters (which I’m more interested in) 
The rest of the features are very superficial 

I felt that they just wanted to make money for no added value",1
2019-05-09 18:36:46,Privacy concern,"Even though I will not and do not grant access to my contacts on my iPhone, the Linkedin app pulled my contacts into the application and is asking if I would like to send invitations to add these contacts into my network. I appreciate that the application works as advertised; what I do not appreciate is the invasion of privacy. Apple should remove this app until Linkedin chooses to abide by the privacy guidelines conveyed to software developers.",1
2019-01-25 01:54:56,trash UX,"this is rly feedback for my experience on the website, but idk how else to get it to y’all...

#1) stop incessantly prompting me to download this app when im using linked in through my browser. if i wanted it, i would have it. the pop up is infinite deal breaker

#2) when im using the search function, why would i want u to refresh the page and shoot me back to the top?! and lose my place / progress as a result?! no sense at all",1

My job interests are all set up under health, fitness,  personal trainer, sports coach, etc. Too...this app blows.",2
2018-12-10 06:11:47,Editing skills,"Possibly the most tedious thing in the world. The app tells you that you must pin your three top skills.

You try to pin something to the top but it tells you there are three skills already chosen.",2
2018-11-06 16:00:08,Kind of pointless,"So this app functions good, doesn’t crash... So you sign up for a free account. You upload your resume.

There is no advantage or disadvantage to using this app.",2

2018-04-29 19:54:21,LinkedIn continues to Exceed my Expectations!!,I don’t face book. LinkedIn is basically Facebook for adults. I really enjoy articles others have written pertaining to my area of expertise. Bravo LinkedIn just don’t get political on me and I am yours for life!!,5

Won’t let me login after logging itself out, absolutely horrible. I just use the web page from my Safari browser. Really wish they would fix this app to make networking easier again",1
2018-03-22 15:02:54,Decent platform but...,I’ve noticed family members and people I have done retail business with (as a regular consumer) showing up on the “people you may know” feature. Why does LinkedIn know I once bought a Mother’s Day gift from a shop 2 years ago and shows the shop owner in this feature? Is this the next Facebook? How does it know my relatives? Creepy!,2

Every time I open the app I see the same ads, sometimes multiple times a session, even after ‘Teporting’ the ad that ‘I’ve seen too often’..

People think they can say what they want to whomever they want. 
It seems that lots of people realize why life has gotten so antagannistic but do not contain themselves what is said on these sites. 
It is a shame life, our democracy and what is to come until some control is put out and the money for these sites takes a back seat.

Kindly fix this bug as I use the app frequently more than the website.",3
2019-12-08 03:22:48,Very slow,Why does this app take so long to load updates?  It’s very frustrating knowing that I have an update and can’t see it.  It’s not because of poor connection.  It’s because of poor application service by LinkedIn.  I had to delete the app from my phone due to the constant frustration of their slow service.,2
2019-04-23 23:48:27,Optimize for Tablet,"Almost every major platform out there has versions of their mobile apps optimized for phones and one for tablets. I am an avid user and fan, but cannot believe LinkedIn has not optimized their mobile app for tablets.

2018-10-01 23:48:40,More updated more bugs?,"I literally found bugs every single time i use this app after updating it
I don’t know if they update it to get new features in and bugs out or the opposite 
This update the app just freezes when I try to apply for job 
Like no this job I won’t let you apply for it using the browser",2
2018-07-02 21:44:21,Not easy to use,You can’t do too much on the app. The upgrade is expensive and I doubt it would be worth it. It’s not easy to apply for jobs unless you can apply directly through LinkedIn but most jobs don’t allow you to do that. You get tons of notifications for people’s birthdays. This isn’t Facebook; I don’t care when it’s a connection’s birthday or when they have a job anniversary.,1
2017-11-17 15:35:05,Love it!,From the very beginning I have been a fan and can clearly see the advantages of having a LinkedIn account on any level! If you are a professional it is a must have !!!,5
2017-11-28 16:40:51,App was fine but not anymore...,The app started out great... I was able to use it without a problem but for the last week or so whenever I’m using it it always ends up freezing.

LinkedIn users can send requests to add a company to their profile ( e.g CEO at XYZ Limited but must  be subject to verification). Companies should have control over approving or declining requests to list an affiliation/designation. 

Some of my former colleagues who no longer work within the company are still listed as staff with the company profile as their ‘present’ employment.

2020-02-09 21:32:09,What is this company doing if they aren’t actually getting people jobs,The website is full of robots and scammers trying to charge you for everything. The site costs an arm and a leg to be on premium . Sometimes I feel like the site isn’t out here helping people get jobs but making the situation worse.

Even some of their members seem oblivious. If anyone has a better site/app anything, pls comment it I’d appreciate it.",1
2019-02-08 22:34:32,Update for iPad Pro?,The app looks terrible on my new iPad Pro. I’m kind of surprised that something so simple has not been addressed.

2022-06-22 02:39:08,Does not respect your privacy,I got my account restricted after setting it up. I know the only reason it got restricted was because I use a VPN. I know this because I didn’t have LinkedIn long enough to do anything else to violate their “rules”. The fact that I got restricted for using a VPN tells me that this company does not respect your right to privacy. I will not be appealing to come back.,1

I don’t know what changes you made to your developer team but the app constantly says it’s having issues loading pages. Doesn’t matter whether it’s on WIFI or 5G and I have the latest iPhone.

This app also contains THOUSANDS of fake profiles pretending to be legit American citizens adding connections randomly and attempting to scam and/or phish. They are unsurprisingly all from India or China. LinkedIn intentionally harbors them to make it seem like more people use their app. You can read multiple reports by the FBI and other intelligence agencies.

2019-11-12 18:56:06,Be cautious of spam,I downloaded this app and created a profile specifically for the purpose of job seeking. Their job ads take you to links that will spam up your email making you think you are applying for a job.

2020-07-21 17:50:38,Can’t sort by most recent,"It seems absolutely ridiculous to me that there is no option to sort your feed by most recent. The app only sorts it by top news.

2020-02-05 04:14:10,Subscription on apple phones,Do not sign up for subscription through the app because you cannot get a refund when there are problems. The payment comes through the App Store instead of directly to linked in and they are not able to support you. Apple does not make it clear what you are paying for and how.,1
2019-03-05 15:59:18,Great source of Info but too much Solicitation,I use LinkedIn often for articles and networking. The only drawback is the daily connection and email solicitations from sales reps that all sound exactly the same.,4

2023-03-16 01:44:53,Overcharging,I regret updating the app. I now have to pay for a subscription to do things I was able to do before like searching for people. They’re trying to make money of basic things we were able to do before. Do not get this app. I would give it zero stars if I could.,1
2023-01-29 01:23:39,Embarrassing?!,"WHY DOES IT UPDATE EVERYONE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU UPDATE ONE SMALL THING? This app needs a Gen Z on their team to teach them how to not make this platform so clunky and embarrassing.

Got email about auto renewal and charge from Apple. Wrote back within hours to explain I did not wish to renew. Then got steps to cancel subscription via Apple (love how this is the ONE area that is not intuitive nor easy to access). I was informed via two robo messages that I would not be reimbursed.

2023-08-17 21:31:57,Locations are removed,How does a job search/networking app remove locations from user profiles when it's one of the most critical features for Recruiters and other users? It promotes fake profiles and loses any legitimacy. This issue needs to be fixed asap or this app will quickly move towards irrelevance.,1

2023-02-01 22:11:59,App completely broken with latest update,It now brings up a screen asking what sort of job you’re looking for. This screen can’t be dismissed so you have to fill in something even if you’re not looking. Basically you can’t use the app unless you’re open to work.,1

2022-04-07 12:26:37,Predatory Garbage,Once a great tool for professional networking. Get a sense that good UX engineering ideas were all dismissed and replaced with useless courses and certifications which have no real institutional backing.

This is the original review I wrote a while back. Still not really fixed.

2023-07-13 21:50:18,Sort feed by Recent vs. top,Surprised the app still doesn’t have an option to sort by recent posts vs. Top posts. Makes using the app useless as compared to the web version.,3
2023-10-14 21:54:06,Slow loading,"The app and even on browser takes forever to load. This is very frustrating. Have tried removing background apps, switching browsers, clearing cache. But nothing works. What’s the point of paying for premium when one can’t even get work done efficiently.",1
2023-10-06 05:39:00,TL;DR devs are idiots,I have the new catch up feature on the app. It is the dumbest thing to ever put on an app. It shows absolutely nothing meaningful and constantly showing a notification making me open the app. Remove it or give me the option to disable.

2022-11-12 01:13:44,Billing Settings Inaccessible In-App,Why do we need to access LinkedIn premium billing settings on a Desktop. Would prefer being able to access this on the phone app as well.,3
2022-10-26 17:18:49,Easily worst iOS app I’ve used from a major company,"LinkedIn is great. I love the service. Why is the app so bad?!

Scrolling on the job lists is weird. 

Every time you leave the app the app refreshes. Multitasking with linked in doesn’t work. And if you reload chances are good you will NEVER find the post you were JUST reading. It’s maddening.",1
2022-08-28 18:33:51,Too many bugs,The site is slow when posting with a picture on Chrome PC. I tried posting on the app and it was worse. Why so difficult to post? No draft to save failed post and now I have to retype?,2
2022-06-24 16:45:07,Just Another Social Media App,I’ve been on for about 6 years. It has become just another social media app. Very little real content. Lots of posts that should be Facebook or Instagram. Not much in the way of real substance for career growth or making connections.,2
2022-05-05 13:26:45,Not working on cellular data,The app has stopped working with cellular data and is only working with wifi. I’ve checked my settings and it’s set correctly to use cellular data. Fairly useless app if it doesn’t connect,2

2021-11-18 00:43:14,Behind the times,I’ve always used the services of LinkedIn to help branch out for my career. But receiving emails about jobs I’m not interested in as well as waiting almost two years for a dark mode version. I’ll stick to randomly looking at my LinkedIn online on a browser or desktop.,1

2021-08-13 01:40:32,Not stable,The app just will not load on iPhone X.  Sometimes have to open it 6-7 times before it will load.  Love it.  Use it every day.  Just something not working with it on iPhones.,3

2021-03-30 21:44:40,Ads are out of control,"WAY too many ads.  Every other post in your feed is an ad, so 50% ad ratio. I've reported ads dozens of times because I see the same ones over and over.  They're never removed. LinkedIn used to be much better, now it's essentially an ad network.",2

I cannot close my account! My premium has been cancelled for a month and I still get a message that I must “convert my premium to a basic membership” to close!!! But I don’t even have premium anymore! 

I have reached out to  customer care to no avail. It’s like a horror movie you cannot escape from. I feel incredibly violated to not have control over such a basic decision regarding my online presence.

Do not join LinkedIn! You can never get out!",1

Today’s 12/9 software update is causing the app to require signing back on and then after a page of scrolling will sign you out and require you to sign back on. It’s basically unusable until the update is fixed.",1
2020-04-12 16:18:57,Dishonest Account Charging,"I really do like being a part of linkd in. What I don’t like is signing up for a free month of premium and getting slammed without warning for a $60 charge. I did the free trial with the intention of renewing through my purchasing card through work. Instead of informing me or asking what payment method to continue with, it auto charges my iTunes account. Not cool.",1
2020-04-02 19:37:40,"Does what it’s supposed, just be prepared for upselling.","I deleted the app because I got tired of it asking me to sync my contacts. Seemed like it was every other time I opened the app that I would have to skip through it.

2020-02-16 05:39:24,Horrible app,"This is probably the worst app in the app store, it doesn’t even run! And after that it can’t recognize usernames and passwords even less. This app is supposed to facilitate connections and networking not make them harder to approach.

And no developers I will not send an email about this. “Classic response to look good in the app store, send an email and we’ll help”, yeah right.",1
2020-01-08 06:31:59,Waste of time,"Sooooo I went and made an account and when I was going to upload my photo, it booted me out so, I went to sign in again and it said it couldn’t find my email. So I went and created an account again and it said email already in use. Also it made me do I’m not a robot verification about 10 times. Definitely a waste of time.",1
2019-08-29 22:10:46,Don’t subscribe to this!,"They make it nearly impossible to access Recruiter Lite if you have regular LinkedIn on the same device. I have been trying to cancel for months now.

2019-03-19 10:18:32,Poor UI. Needs split screen.,"LinkedIn dominates networking in the business arena. Why is so much lacking in the iPad interface?  The actual content only takes up approximately half the screen and is in the center. So much wasted space on the left and right side. Other apps should not be forced to have a temporary appearance. 

Please update the interface.",1
2019-02-12 14:09:36,Doesn’t work on mobile data,For whatever reason this app doesn’t update when I’m using data. It will only work when using WiFi which seems silly. It is otherwise a fine mobile version of the platform.,2
2018-11-29 15:59:47,Good app but needs to be optimized for new iPad displays,"The app interface is nice and clean, but could it please be updated to fit the new 11 inch and 12.5 inch IPad Pro displays? As of now, there are black borders all over the place and it’s not taking advantage of all the new screen real estate.",3
2018-04-20 17:22:44,Old feature should come back,"Old versions of Linkedin App was adding new connections to iPhone contacts or complete contact information using linkedin profiles and adds a URL to contact field.

2017-09-29 03:42:55,STOP ASKING ME TO CONNECT MY CONTACTS,Seriously what the hell LinkedIn??? Facebook wasn’t even this bad in asking me to share my information. I DO NOT WANT TO and WILL NOT share my contacts with you. Why is there no option for the app to stop asking you?? This drives me nuts because it pops up every time I open the app. This is so bad I honestly want to uninstall and remove the app solely for this reason.,1

I need to completely close the app in order for my phone to work again. This was not the case a few months ago. I will update my review if it ever gets fixed.,2
2019-01-01 13:27:44,"Tons of job hits, but terrible while applying!","On the positive side, I get tons of job hits through LinkedIn, and generally enjoy the app (minus clickbait which I try to filter).

2018-11-09 10:14:24,Buggy as all hell.,"Very annoying to use when trying to make quick edits on mobile. Any edit results in “operation failed”. But then you refresh and the changes you made do actually show up!

2018-10-14 18:53:39,Freezing,So I have been trying to complete an application on the app for 30 minuets now because the screen freezes and I have to close the app then search the job again and start the process again and again. Very frustrating.,2

2017-09-24 01:01:50,Keeps making me log in,I probably logged and I am not joking 20 times within the last 30 minutes. It keeps kicking me off while looking through jobs and applying. Not a good app. The website even does the same. A little ridiculous...,2

2023-09-12 05:38:29,QR Scanner Not Working! Utterly frustrating!,"After installing the app, the QR scanner only works once after granting access to the camera. Soon after that, the QR Scanner is never able to open the camera again, even though access is granted in the iPhone settings.",1
2022-10-11 15:30:59,Some of my best opportunities have come through LinkedIn,LinkedIn for the win,5
2023-01-06 12:02:40,The update was supposed to bring stability,"But it didn’t. 
Really hard to use the app to send messages or create posts. It would crash after I type 2-3 lines. 
Immediately crashes after I try to add an alt to a photo. 
iPhone 11, up-to-date iOS and linkedin versions.",1
2022-12-16 16:19:22,Crashes + LinkedIn Removed Help Center Access,"Been a paying customer of this app for several years now.  On my business page, when sending invites to my network for page following purposes, when I click “Send Invites…”, the app crashes.  This has occurred 10x.

The app, the version I have, does not allow me to create a Help Ticket for this issue or any issue.  

I attempted to complete both processes via desktop; however both failed (unable to send invites and unable to open a Help Ticket).

Thinking “strong pass” here.",1
2021-09-29 23:50:06,No responsible design for landscape view?,It seems like there is terrible layout after opened a home page in the landscape view on iPad. All the contents are packed to the left.,3
2022-07-06 15:55:22,Too Many Ads and Notifications (paid member),"I have a paid membership and even with that, LinkedIn sends too many notifications to my smartphone and even email that are mostly irrelevant or spam.",2
2022-06-02 21:38:03,Limiting the number of employees show,"Seems LinkedIn is now limiting the number of employees it displays for a company, unless you upgrade to their premium plan. Really LinkedIn? Are you that desperate for cash that you have to take it from the rest of us?",2
2022-02-03 15:08:00,Downloaded and deleted immediately,The amount of information this app steals is astonishing. People need to quit giving companies like this free traffic and data. I’m surprised these companies aren’t making you sign over your first-born just to have a profile. What a joke.,1
2021-04-01 23:53:52,Editing on the app on IPhone,I can not edit my description because the keyboard on the app won’t go away there is no way to scroll down or let the keyboard disappear to save my new edited description. Please fix it.,3
2021-09-28 02:52:20,No dark mode,I recently upgraded to an iPhone 13 from an iPhone XS and suddenly dark mode is not enabled on my account and no longer showing up as an option in settings. Is this a bug?,2
2021-08-23 14:48:33,worst than facebook no customer support,i’m having issues adding promotions that i received from my employers but have not been able to. i contacted customer support via email because they don’t have a 1800 number like other companies. it’s should be so difficult for this task and it should t take more than week to fix. when a company is in the business of bringing employers and employees together they should be regulated and offer better customer service and fix the issues i am having.,1
2021-05-22 02:53:16,Love the app but update is very buggy,"Hello, 
I am writing to notify they my app has crashed multiple times whenever I try to add a new experience. Please fix. Otherwise it has been an outstanding app for networking and job search.",2
2020-11-11 23:35:42,Disappointing update,"UI leaves a lot to be desired. So much white space and poor contrast. Content on pages looks crowded and is hard to differentiate. Navigation Bar at the bottom blends in too much. Grey icons are meh, which basically sums up the UX. I do like the new logo that appears when the app is launched.",2
2021-03-10 19:17:42,Slows down phone and crashes constantly,"If you are trying to get any networking done, expect it to take about 5x longer on your iPhone. Slows down the phone horribly and crashes about every 3-5 mins. Support needs to get on pushing actually useful updates that fix stability. On going for about 2 weeks now.",1
2020-08-21 03:10:25,Fix your algorithm or news feed,I keep seeing the same old news feeds and or post from the same people. 2 month old content isn’t relevant 2 months later when I have already seen it populate on my feed every week.,2

2020-03-01 13:25:53,Improve time feed,LinkedIn is great for your professional network but I find their time feed very frustrating. Just show posts from my network in chronological order!,3
2019-12-13 07:02:55,Forced Updates,The recent updates are not compatible with older devices. The latest update doesn't even allow access into the app. This is the only app on my iPad 2 that won't update. This networking app should be available to all members not just those with the newest devices. Disappointing.,1
2019-06-05 14:18:13,Horrible App,"The app is horribly designed. Notifications pop up at the top non stop about random settings options, it’s very distracting to the point where I cannot get anything done. Also the app won’t even let me scroll up to the search bar it’s like it’s not made to work with my iPhone XS. Absolutely terrible experience.",1
2019-05-31 20:16:13,Constant pop up,"Every single time I open the app it asks me to sync my contacts. I don’t want to, so I click the x in the upper left corner. The next time I open the app it happens again and again. Please fix this",3
2019-05-22 08:09:21,App is not working / unresponsive,"I am using the iPhone 7, latest iOS 12.2, and after uninstalling and reinstalling the LinkedIn app, it does not work. The news feed will not load, and my profile is inaccessible. There is an issue that needs to be resolved ASAP.",2

2019-03-21 16:37:36,Hard to use web site makes me close account,I simply wanted to log out of my account through the web. NO I don’t want to download the app. It wouldn’t let me sign out so I closed my account. I can’t even send messages without paying money? Ugh. LinkedIn has turned to trash. So frustrating to use so don’t even bother.,1
2019-01-12 21:09:01,Stop trying to trick us with every update,"Lowering my rating mainly because I’m sick and tired of LinkedIn trying to trick us every time we update. STOP trying to get me to upload my contacts, STOP with all the recommendations for connections when I update. If I haven’t done it yet I’m not going to.",2
2018-12-12 03:38:19,Annoying Notifications,Just turn the notifications setting off for LinkedIn. The app generates a minimum of two automatic notifications a day for nothing to con you into opening the app so they generate traffic.,3
2018-11-26 16:34:44,Quit,When asked if you know someone and say connect or delete pleas make it delete and quit asking about the same person for weeks at a time - whenever you open the app it asks again and again. Please fix this 😡😡😡😡😡,2
2018-11-25 17:12:22,Why force me to connect,"I can understand why you make suggestions to connect, but can you stop making the same suggestion after I dismiss it more than a dozen times? Why are you so persistent and ignore all the feedbacks user gives to you? So annoying!",2
2018-08-18 07:55:42,Gangster app!,"The Plattform itself is good, indeed provides a lot of opportunities, information and help to keep you up to date for the HR market, but I don’t understand the why forced me to update otherwise I’ll never be able to view it? Gangster app! “ you take my house rule or get out!”(sadly I could only take it, fortunately I can write a review about it).",1
2018-06-16 20:22:44,Meh...,"Much like the mobile site, no ability to set the feed to “most recent” or some such. Why on Earth would I want to see work updates from 3 months ago next to a news page from 8 hrs ago? How/why is this in any algorithm not written by a 12 yr old?",2
2017-12-15 13:36:49,Great App!,I have been able to connect with many from my industry!! Easy to apply to jobs via app!,5
2018-04-10 11:20:49,About to ditch the bloated and annoying app and just use web interface,"Over 200MB for an app that does nothing that I cant do via the website with any browser on my phone.

It also takes 2 minutes to open up and nags me about reviews.

Sick of bloat.",2
2017-12-02 10:32:41,Must have for professionals,"Did Ceasar have his Palace and you must have your LinkedIn account. It’s a must for any professional seeking to connect, communicate and narrate.",5

2020-10-20 11:23:40,Can we have dark mode please?,Many tend to use LinkedIn for several hours everyday. Having dark mode would be really helpful.,4
2017-10-16 12:13:59,A must for business,Makes networking at your fingertips possible.,5
2017-09-15 02:11:09,LinkedIn,More user friendly. More communication. More everything than when I first LinkedIn.,5
2023-08-19 03:41:59,Scams,I want to know what indeed is doing to screen jobs so we don’t get scammed. I have run into more fake job postings than real ones on this app. Indeed used to be my go-to but it seems that in the last 4 years it has been nothing but trash. I would give a negative star rating if I could.,1

2023-05-25 19:06:33,Translate not working,For some reason the translating of posts functionality stopped working. Please get this sorted out since it’s been a few months now,3
2023-03-22 14:31:49,Scroll Views Get Stuck,"What is with the scroll views in your app becoming unresponsive constantly? Please fix this. Implement a normal UX like the Load More pattern, if this is about loading. But it feels more like an input issue to me.",3
2023-03-04 07:53:53,Job Search Filters Broken,"Job search utility is much less useful since trying to use more than one filter resets all other filters. This isn’t how non-iOS versions of LinkedIn work, so it could be a bug.",2
2023-03-01 02:06:16,Side effect of app update???,"My account got restricted after the app updated a series of privacy protection. The AI can’t even approve my ID photos submitted with my appeal, but I mean I got a lot of visas approved with those photos…… I really don’t know what’s going on with LinkedIn right now.",2
2023-02-19 05:42:32,Names in a vertical column,"With the most recent updates, when I click on the various “like” icons on to see who “liked” a post, the names are all rendered vertically, letter on top of letter in a column.  What happened?  Please fix.",3
2023-01-05 19:42:01,Professionalism doesn’t exist,"This has turned into an alternate Facebook. Constant political posts, obituaries, religious arguments, and no helpful information. The jobs being recommended to me are not even remotely relevant. Come to think of it, LinkedIn has never helped me get a job. I will only use Indeed from now on.",1
2023-01-01 19:44:55,impossible to find actual postings,it’s impossible to find an actual job posting that isn’t promoted and has 300+ applicants and doesn’t match what you’re searching for. no one on LinkedIn likes it and it just makes job searching more difficult,1
2022-08-10 14:19:26,Unable to click LI links and redirect to app,"I have the LinkedIn app installed and updated. Whenever I click a LinkedIn link from my mobile phone (ex. Slack or Messages) it always takes me to mobile web. When I click continue in app, it takes me to Apple App Store. Please fix your deep linking.",1
2022-05-09 14:25:54,Lagging,This application is too much lagging . I am using in iphone 11 and seriously my keyboard gets stuck everytime i chat in here . Its fine in outside other application at a same time,3
2022-01-20 15:28:33,Good but needs improvement,The LinkedIn and LinkedIn Recruiter apps lack some of the important features that are available on the desktop/laptop.,3
2022-01-18 10:35:19,Used to work now just goes to website,"It used to work fine. Now I have to log in every time I open the app, and when I do it takes me to a black screen web page and doesn’t work at all.  Completely broken currently on iPhone 12 Pro Max.",1
2021-12-30 15:39:35,Censorship getting out of hand,LinkedIn has been part of my daily routine for years but I’m phasing out my activity because it’s becoming another echo chamber of groupthink. The censorship has gotten out of control. They take down posts about hunting from outdoor companies and things like that.,1
2020-12-08 12:48:21,Unstable,"New update means that half the time at least I need to log out and log back in every time I want to see notifications or My Network updates. It says ""something went wrong, please refresh"" which doesn't work.",2
2020-08-04 16:39:51,Glitchy App,"This app fails to edit basic information. I have experienced significant issues with this app, including failure to post items. There is no mechanism to open tickets. I cannot resolve technical issues. It discourages me from using the application if it does not work.",2

2019-10-11 23:07:43,Skills,This is a really good app. However I’ve been unable to add any skills. It gives me an error every single time. How will people know my skills if I can’t display them?,4

2019-12-23 03:28:10,No longer works,"Open app. Forced upgrade notice. New app does support my iOS version. Can't use app. Oh well. It's not that helpful anyway. Back to buying google ads. Oh and I even paid for special linkedin juice. Shame they stopped supporting iOS! Actually, I wonder if a forced redirect to App Store is a violation of Apple policies or not. I'll check on that next!!",1
2019-12-17 12:00:45,Bummer,"As with many others, the latest app isn't compatible with my 8-year old iPad. 

After sending this review, I was contacted by Apple and asked for more information concerning app version and model/version of my iPad. Unfortunately, the link provided by Apple fails to open, so I was unable to to answer TK's questions...

Still a bummer!",1
2018-10-22 20:02:55,Pretty good,"I suspect that they duplicate items in my feet that I’ve already seen. It’s a waste of my time. 

Wish they’d stop telling me about people’s birthdays; I find it 1. Unprofessional and 2. Annoying",4
2019-05-20 16:12:41,Reformat needed,"This app is too large for the iPhone X. The search bar is covered over by the notch at the top of the screen for iPhone X, leaving me unable to use the search bar. I can’t tap on the search bar to use it.",3
2019-05-09 15:59:44,Garbage app missing functionality,"There’s seemingly no way to add a personalized note to a connection request from the iPad app, despite their knowledgebase saying that you can do so. I also seemingly can’t access the web version of LinkedIn from the same iPad (a 2017 model). LinkedIn is a hot garbage app for a necessary evil, the Facebook of professional networking.",1
2019-04-12 13:45:04,Don’t trust this app,"Got a text message from someone I had met in person and had absolutely no interaction or connection with on LinkedIn or anywhere online.

It’s sending people invites that I do not know! Please fix ASAP.",1
2018-11-06 12:24:58,Terrible customer service,"I was testing the trial but the truth does not captivate me, for what I was looking for it does not fulfill my needs so I stopped using it. Cancel the subscription one Sunday before renewal and no mercy, they also charged the renewal and are the 60 $ more wasted since I am not satisfied with this application and for them there is no way to fix it.",1
2018-10-23 00:55:28,LinkedIn is trash,"For work, I had to “use my free trial” to watch some in learning videos. The videos were boring and out dated. I forgot to cancel after the trial and was charged 34$ with no warning or notification. They have a no refund policy even if you don’t use your account and are impossible to contact. Immoral business with deceptive tactics.",1

2021-05-04 16:14:55,Trouble with Job Postings,"Whenever I look at the job postings on my new iPad Pro, I don’t see the first paragraph or so of the job description. As my only functioning computer at the moment, this really makes it difficult to prepare for my interviews.",1
2021-02-21 09:38:36,I do not like the new update. It makes me sign in multiple times per session while using it.,"I don't like that the app no longer lets me view horizontally, so I've stopped using it. Please add that back as a feature for the iPad version.",1

2020-12-11 13:32:50,App Buggy,"I don’t know if there was a recent update, but every time I attempt to access the app I need to sign in again. This was never an issue. LinkedIn becoming less of a professional utility, especially if there’s this much friction when using the app.",1
2020-12-06 23:22:08,App keeps logging me out,"Ever since the last update, I’ve been logged out automatically every time I switch to a different app and back. This is the case even when I open a link within the app and close the embedded browser.",1
2020-09-06 03:27:57,Job search trash,The only job offers I get are PMs about opportunities that are very sketchy to say the least. All the posts on the wall are VERY politically conservative and leave no doubt in my mind that I wouldn’t want to work for any of these ‘employers.’,2
2020-03-18 14:04:52,Distorts profile photo,Distorts profile photo. I removed and downloaded  the app and it still continues to do this to my profile picture.  I don’t know the app version as it updates on it’s own.  I have an iPhone pro 11,2
2019-05-24 12:57:21,Unsafe,"After a client invited me to join I started receiving various spam emails feigning to be LinkedIn. Several had Dropbox links that infiltrated contact list and attached to emails.

Otherwise this is a great app.",3
2018-10-01 15:47:58,Nearly unusable,Was a fantastic app now extremely buggy. Notifications refuse to load majority of the time requiring the app to be force closed and reopened. Constantly gets stuck on loading screens for messages and search. Nearly unusable now.,1
2018-09-22 22:08:29,iPhone 7S,I have an iPhone 7S. I’ve had the phone for over a year. I’ve always had issues posting simple pictures to LinkedIn. I also post pictures to Instagram & Twitter and have no issues on those apps.,2
2018-07-30 21:07:12,It’s a SCAM,"For weeks, I received emails to try their upgrade for a month at no cost. I took the bait. Only problem, there’s no user friendly way to downgrade to the free service. So, I’m stuck with a $65 monthly payment for a service that don’t want. 

GIVE ME MY $$$$ back, LinkedIn!!!!! And stop raping my bank account.",1
2018-05-07 01:19:29,Freezes up and kicks me out,What was once a fantastic app for connecting with amazing professionals is now frustrating. Each time I try to open the app I get kicked back out or it repeatedly freezes and won’t upload pictures or videos.,1
2018-04-18 12:28:27,REMOVE OPTION TO SAVE PHOTOS!,"I view a photo in LinkedIn, go to close it, and accidentally save the photo to my pictures. Why in the world is there a shortcut to that on the app when I can screenshot from my phone. This is extremely annoying and need to be fixed immediately",1

2017-11-27 02:57:10,There is bugs you need to fix!,"You need to do some work on UX! Both web and app. When people send me job posting and I open it, it always ask me to sign in. And when I sign in, it goes to my home page. It’s a loop and it never goes to that job posting. So frustrated!",1

2017-11-09 18:06:45,Unusable,I have no clue how to search for a job and half the stuff on the app doesn’t even pertain to finding a job it’s stupid I wish it would just tell me if there are openings in my area and tell me how to apply I’d rather drive 10 miles and fill out a paper then use this app,1
2017-11-03 00:02:40,Useful app for professionals,"Most important App to network with professionals worldwide.
I would recommend it.",5

2023-09-21 03:28:29,Frustrated,"I can't get the keyboard to come up so I can search for things or post. Second, I am very frustrated with the verification process because it doesn't recognize my ID. It wants it closer, but it blurs my ID and won't work. Fix it LinkedIn.",1
2023-08-20 18:47:38,Don’t get fooled into Subscribing!,"The app will say “someone looked at your profile, subscribe to find out who”, but then still hide the people, or “subscribe to be able to send messages” and then not let you send messages.  It’s a scam.",1
2023-08-08 11:33:41,Logging in is impossible and constant resets and downloads aren’t helping,Use Linked in occasionally but recently the entire app seems stupid. Can’t log in. Can sometimes instant message. Need some answers? Delete it.,1
2023-08-03 03:38:13,Mobile Version Is Trash,"The mobile version doesn’t let me see anyone’s profile photos, even people I’m connected to. Also, when I upload my profile photo it shifts it up and cuts off my face.",1
2023-07-26 15:05:12,Acc restricted,I got banned on my two accounts and couldn’t even try to verify because this app doesn’t support my country ID and only supports Passport which is bad for me since I don’t have passport yet. It’ll be good if they support any type of governmental ID.,1
2023-03-25 19:15:53,So many scams,I’m convinced at least 60% of the job postings are scams. For every 5 jobs I apply for I get 1-2 responses that are scams. LinkedIn needs to find a better way to weed these out. Really disappointing.,2
2023-03-15 16:04:55,No customer support,Been trying to reach out the their support team for a while and no one wants to help. I’ve tried everything with this lame app but it won’t even open on my phone. Sad.,1

2022-06-02 11:38:28,Data Hog,"Could the LinkedIn app use any more “Data Linked to You”? You really need my purchases, sensitive information, financial information, etc?

No thanks, I will stick to using the web version in private mode.",1
2022-05-18 16:10:32,iPad interface is garbage,How is this even possible this many years into LinkedIns existence? Baffled by how out of touch landscape mode is on an iPad Pro. It’s like they’re now even trying to make a user experience worth being on the app.,1
2022-01-22 18:37:53,App requiring me to change my password every time I open it?,"I’m not sure if there was an update, but as of today (1/22) it isn’t letting me open the app normally. It wants me to change my password each time..",1
2021-12-21 07:00:00,One star for forced updates,"Come on.  Stop it with the forced updates.  Let me do it when it is convenient for ME, not when you devs make any menial updates.  Pathetic practice, I look forward to the day when it is stopped.",1

2021-10-14 01:45:43,Trash app,"The app keeps crashing and freezing when I give endorsements to my coworkers. The number of connections keep bugging out or even disappear.

How am I supposed to connect with my peers professionally if I can’t use the app while on the go?",1
2021-07-29 14:28:38,Notifications,"While I appreciate the professional platform created to help network.  

It appears this app does not follow the app control permissions. 

Example:
I have cellular data turned off and am not in WiFi.  There is no why I should get an app notification, yet some how I do.

It seems it is designed to be additive to ignore the controls set by the iPhone and wanting me to keep checking alerts.",2
2020-08-26 01:39:28,Linked with other social network,I can’t link my LinkedIn profile with WeChat anymore.,4
2020-12-11 21:25:24,Authenticate every time? No thanks,"I don’t know what happened in the latest update, but I have to login every time I open the app now.

2020-12-10 13:23:56,What is going on?!,The new app update is requiring me to log in every time I want to use the app. It also logs me out while I’m actively using it. I’ve never had this problem before and it also doesn’t appear to be impacting the browser version.,1

2020-01-12 22:17:49,Disappointed,"Since the last update, every time I start the app, it reminds me of all the people I could or should connect to. When I want to connect to someone, I will make that decision myself. Until this is changed, I’ll stick to LinkedIn online.",1
2019-10-08 01:57:58,Worst Form of Social Media,I hate LinkedIn. It’s literally just a work version of Facebook..like ew. I cringe at the thought of adding these people on a form of social media and it’s just irritating that having a LinkedIn profile is expected nowadays to get a job. I wish this app didn’t exist.,1
2019-08-18 16:15:48,Made up notifications,"LinkedIn gives me a notification a few moments after I close the app. When I open it, the notifications are for the most trivial things.",2

2019-08-12 22:15:55,Doesn’t load anything,"For some reason, this app fails to load content 90% of the time, though it continues to produce notifications reliably. Where the app fails, the web version always works quickly and reliably.",1

2018-11-21 00:47:45,Too many slash screens,"You guys have like 15 splash screens on app launch, that is absolutely insane and extremely annoying.

2018-10-27 21:01:50,Poor App Compatibility,App does not work with iPhone SE. The news feed takes the whole screen and there is no clear way to navigate to anything else. You can see how the title is cut off at the top. I’m surprised that a company like LinkedIn can’t figure out responsive app design.,1

2018-03-19 10:37:29,Notifications D-,App gives me “Red Circle 1” notification EVERY day but there are no notifications and all notifications are turned off. I have OCD and can not stand to see the red notification red circle. This is extremely annoying. About to cancel account and uninstall.,1
2018-03-12 22:01:33,Just two features I would like to see,"All in all is a fair app. 
Two things that should be changed is the way of erasing/blocking people (it is really necessary to enter to someone account to deactivate oneself from there?)...kind of duh~

Second, not everyone want/can apply for a job in US, a country filter will be desirable (particularly I not interested to see jobs from that country)

Thanks",3
2018-01-23 02:26:48,Notifications are annoying,I got annoyed with all the notifications I was getting from this app so I turned them all off (it was pretty hard because there are dozens of them). Now I get notified that I don’t have notifications turned on. Garbage.,1

2023-07-01 22:37:07,Horrible,This app is terrible if you’re actually looking for a job. There very little jobs listed. It’s just a bunch of high level managers posting about how great their job is that they’re over paid for.,1
2023-05-28 15:55:14,Too many spam and sales messages,The worst thing about using LinkedIn is the scammers and recruiters from India that send you messages at 3 am from fake profiles. And the cringy post from narcissistic “professionals.”,2
2023-05-16 14:35:32,Too many old promoted jobs,"When I’m searching for a job, the only one that pops up are promoted job postings/ads that are over 2 weeks old with over 200 applicants. Applicants want to see new job postings. Not old one.",1

But, LinkedIn keeps flipping my flag to “not seeking work” because I ignore these nuisance spammers.

Oh, let me just say I am not seeking biz from Ukrainians or Russians or Azerbaijans either.

(No offense to Ukraine, but a lot of Russian thugs are pretending to be Ukrainians forcing me to ignore ALL Ukrainians … which to be honest I do not do seek overseas business nor do I seek overseas partners). 

So to have my account annoyingly bothered by these accounts and have LinkedIn affect me NEGATIVELY is causing me to look for alternatives!

LinkedIn is becoming a WASTE OF TIME!",1

2022-06-27 23:00:09,Social Media,LinkedIn has evolved from a business networking app to a social media app (Facebook). The majority of the content is not relevant for business professionals and belongs elsewhere and it appears LinkedIn does nothing to monitor content.,1

2021-02-28 09:41:11,Needs better security against job scams,LinkedIn is great overall! However I think better authentication methods and security infrastructures are needed to aid in decreasing job scams and fake recruiters.,3
2018-11-07 10:58:50,Updated Review,This is a good app. I just don’t like that I’ve can’t search for jobs in a specific region.,4
2021-01-08 01:27:20,Ok but needs dark mode,App is overall okay but I cannot stand how blinding the interface is at night. Every app I use has updated for native dark mode support over the last two years but LinkedIn still refuses to support it.,1
2020-12-12 01:46:47,Awful updates,"Not sure what you did to the app but it barely works. Have to login every time, content won’t load and stories all show errors. This is across WiFi and cellular at different locations. Beef up the QA team",1

2020-12-09 17:21:17,How many times to login,"Lately I have been forced to login every time I launch the LinkedIn app.

2019-11-23 22:30:05,"Dropping out of some service, but staying with other services","The role of LinkedIn is changing somewhat, and I am simply dropping the employment notification part. I retired some time ago, but I wanted to see how the employment sector works. I have learned how it works, and how easy it is to narrow down the advertisers and stick with friends that have lots of knowledge of finance, energy, politics, healthcare, and investment management. I hope to continue the basic service, but delete all of the add on support for job listers and speakers. I have about 2000 followers, a lot of whom are media, and they do sometimes utilize my comments for their customers. I am also in Bill Gates Notes, and I have the full Microsoft list of things like excell, one drive, etc. I will be continuing this relationship on LinkedIn.

Also, my ongoing membership renews in January. I would like to continue the basic service, but delete the approximately $700 service which I had for the past few years. I don’t use the job service since it seems primarily geared to beginners. As an additional comment, I don’t think the service is very helpful. As an example, in the areas where I know salaries and incomes (some of which are disclosed in annual salary disclosures) I found the numbers in the job review to be off a lot. In some cases a CFO has a listed salary of about $200,000. When the person today would be making 8-10 times that amount. Would I apply (I am retired, not interested in jobs or training) apply for a job that the salary listing indicates the salary at the 10% level? It looks as if most of the salaries are for very young people.

After deleting the job hunting data, could you send me a note with the cost of staying on the service for another year? I would like to stay on if possible. I will wait to hear from you. On my current subscription I definitely would not be interested in keeping it for another year.",5

2022-07-07 23:09:58,Not sure about LinkedIn,"I set up a profile and everything was great until a former coworker of mine plagiarized my resume. She never got certified for typing skills and I’m a fast typed and she wasn’t (she said so herself because she was too busy being a mom and don’t care to go back to school etc. to develop more skills), got the idea to conveniently edit her skills and work history description from looking at my profile and even my schools were indicated on LinkedIn, worse thing was she got herself a job in Stanford Healthcare where I was applying too previously. She was a temp in the company I worked for where we met, and so her duties were limited and she made it look like she got these skills (I did because I went to school and did volunteering aside from other professional networking in person) but because of my resume and her plagiarizing skills, she got a job. They thought she was this person who has the skills! She never went to college, I did (but maybe because people nowadays glorify dropouts and just HS grads or less, she got the job of analyzing patient charts written by cardiologists, she never took anatomy and physiology and medical terminology, but I did!). I’m proud of the hard work I put in. And the magazine for the profession even published her as this hardworking person. Liar. Using the words from my resume. She never got those opportunities when it was just her own original resume. Never believe the hype. I would have enjoyed networking if not for plagiarizers. I saw her profile before she changed her LinkedIn “skills” and job history including description she copied! So I just go there to network with my classmates, fellow scientists and other STEM professionals. Definitely don’t use this app for job applications because you never know, your resume might be copied like my former coworker did! No protection from plagiarizers. Because of that big major reason, I limit my use and deleted the app. Told my network what happened. I’m thinking of contacting the company and reporting her for plagiarism. (Stanford has my resume long before I put it on LinkedIn and before she copied them). Absolutely disgusting and if you are a minority you will be disadvantaged by a group of women belonging to a certain race that dominates the upper level/rank positions because you just don’t belong. I get that from LinkedIn and companies who hire a certain skin color and race so degrees and board certifications are overlook.",2

2020-12-22 18:47:56,Losing its appeal,"LinkedIn as a platform to find and be found for job opportunities is great, but it’s shifting into being Facebook with stories and how the posts are used. I’m spammed for jobs in messages that are not remotely relevant to my experience and you’ve removed the ability to communicate to recruiters what I’m passionate about. 

Despite marking I’m not interested in contract roles, I’m contacted about them non-stop. Create a way for me to not show up to these recruiters or for me to report them soliciting contracts that I have no interest in. As a user right now I feel like I’m entirely at the mercy of whatever a recruiter wants to talk about and recruiters/companies are taking advantage of their controlling position in the job market. I can get all of that nonsense by posting my profile on Indeed or other websites, make LinkedIn a far more comprehensive platform for job seekers as well. 

I understand you’re working to increase time on app, engagement, and other metrics with the use of posts, but it more and more resembles Facebook. It’s becoming so far from business oriented and nothing remotely close to productive. It feels like you’re struggling to decide if you want to be a social media platform or if you want to be a professional/work based platform. Why are you adding features that Instagram and other social media apps have? Instead, why don’t you build out better ways to ensure jobs are actively being filled instead of farming for resumes, ways for users to control what employers and roles they see and are seen by, etc.. Have you all lost sight of the big picture?",2

2023-06-04 02:07:29,Feedback for LinkedIn,"I hope the developers and product team sees this! I have been using LinkedIn for about 5 years now, and I would love to give some feedback with my personal experiences using LinkedIn.

Needs Improvement On:

1.Privacy - I don’t feel comfortable having all my work experiences available for all LinkedIn members to see. I would recommend having a feature where we can hide previous and/or current work experiences to all LinkedIn members, or have the option to only have recruiters be able to see our work experiences. I don’t have my current work experience added in LinkedIn because I don’t want most people knowing where I work. However, I would be okay with recruiters or hiring managers seeing my work experiences. I know some LinkedIn users who also felt the same. I know we have the option to hide our experiences from search engines and non LinkedIn users, but I would really really appreciate if LinkedIn made the option to hide our work experiences from LinkedIn users.

2.There are so many scammers on LinkedIn — especially with job listings to the point where I get scared to share my phone number, email, and resume with jobs I’ve applied from on LinkedIn. I’ve had a few instances where I applied for jobs on LinkedIn and I got very scammy emails from the “hiring manager” asking me to sign up to get my credit score checked before an interview. I wish LinkedIn only allowed verified hiring managers/recruiters to lists job postings 

3.Saves. It’s easy to find saved job listings, but it is hard for me to find/get to the posts that I have saved previously, especially on the app. I think the saves section should be under events and groups area in the app. I think that will be the easiest and fastest way to access posts that we have saved previously.",3

2022-10-04 14:52:06,I’m losing my reading place. Please give us control of feed refreshing,"While I truly value my LinkedIn connections and their insightful posts, I’m growing more frustrated by the app behavior of auto-refreshing my feed causing me to lose my place. Argh! There are two aspects to this problem:

1) When I pause on a post and click a link to read that link’s content, I may step away from my phone for a bit, especially if that content is a long read. When my iPhone or iPad is reopened LinkedIn decides for me that it will refresh the feed and I lose my place. The same happens in the main LinkedIn feed. I don’t personally want that experience. I’d rather manually decide when I want to refresh and keep a static placeholder on where I left off my reading of posts. How can I do that? 

2) For linked content via url, it would be best if you opened that content in a browser since the browser app would better allow me to retain the content as a static tab. 

For the basic LinkedIn feed, I’m not sure what to do. Yes, I know you offer a “save” feature; however I would normally only save something after reading most of the content and determining whether it’s worth saving. Isn’t that the “save” feature design intent? I’m sure LinkedIn developers didn’t mean for me to save everything I read just in case I might truly want to save it, then have to remove most of the saved content after I decide I don’t need to save it. Yes? That’s backwards.

What happens is when I’ve just started reading a potentially intriguing LinkedIn post, then distracted by something else outside the app, it causes me to lose an otherwise valuable resource because the app refreshes my feed without  my permission when return to the app. 

PLEASE, just give us control, e.g., let user set an “auto-refresh” toggle preference if they chose to do so, or set it as “manual refresh” wherein we can apply a top of screen pull down gesture to initiate the refresh.

What do you say? Can do?

I’m certain I’m not the only one frustrated by this happening.",3

2019-10-07 13:40:18,Nothing more than a social meeting place,At first it seemed professional . A little later it was professional and social people meeting. Looked on my ex-husband’s page he had other accounts  one of his names he called hisself  big bone . Which was a total lie there was nothing big about it and I’m serious . I knew he was talking to other women because that made up a fake account for me  to see if he would flirt. when he got home the entire conversation popes up on his (so called professional) page but he denied that he was big bone. Right as he got home and sat his iPad down the entire conversation popped up on his iPad.  however I’m not stupid it would not be on his page if it wasn’t he who did that. But I have many reasons why I knew he lied about it. I rather not go into full details of how I knew he was using all these sites meeting women . Condoms disappearing. We were together 17 years and for 15 years he had no problem he always let me use his phone or iPad but all of a sudden the last three years it was a problem . he didn’t like me looking at it and he would reset the phone if I grabbed it before he could so  yeah I don’t believe this site is not much different than Facebook Twitter or any of those other sites. Also on LinkedIn he would not accept my friend request so what does that tell me and anyone else I tell this to I just got sick of it and deleted my account not long after I had it . If people would use it professionally like it was made it would be a good site unfortunately they are looking for extra things that other sites have who are not professionals. So my sites deleted I’m happy I did it and I will never install it again.,1

2023-08-15 16:48:04,Undermines Employability,"LinkedIn works against the candidate.  By funneling candidate applications through one clearinghouse (the vast majority of employers place their ads on LinkedIn), the individual candidate is drowned in a pile too high for employers to manage without either neglecting a large portion of applications or processing them through pre-screening software that reduces a candidate to some point in 3- or 4-dimensional space. In the good old day, candidates who were out of work and most desperate to avoid an adverse outcome like eviction enjoyed an advantage over their working counterparts: they had the time to pound pavement and reply via snail mail, fax, or hand delivery to an ad found in the classified section of the local newspaper.  Back then, the employer night receive 80 responses (60 from unemployed job seekers).  But now that the Internet and that software place us all within a few mouse clicks and keystrokes from candidacy status, employers receive 800 applications, 600 from applicants who already have jobs.  Sociologically, LinkedIn and other job portals are not equitable.  They just benefit employers and make the rich among workers richer.  

LinkedIn also encourages its users to contribute to dialogue by posting comments or essays.  I have had interviews rescinded by employers who misinterpreted an essay as some sign that either I am not a 24/7 company man, that I am not a team player, or that I am not a professional who accepts injustices or flaws in the workforce with grace.",1

2023-02-08 01:50:58,Not worth it,"You know that viral tweet has anyone actually gotten an offer from LinkedIn? I’ve never heard of anyone getting a job on LinkedIn. All of my job offers have come from Indeed. But as I had changed my field I thought I would have better chances on LinkedIn so I signed up for Premium. 

4 weeks later and nothing. I’m annoyed I paid $100 and still have 11 months left. I don’t use the Courses, I have Coursera for that. My profile has not been viewed anymore than when I was a basic member. There are not cushy incentives to being a Premium member. In fact even the little gold box telling me “you’re a top applicant” for a job posting is always wrong, so it doesn’t even help cut through the noise. 

As for the UX, it’s buggy. It overheats my iPhone if I’m on it too long. It doesn’t let me save new searches for alerts (must max out at 30). It should have a feature that alerts you to new postings at ALL of the companies you follow. It has old job searches I can’t get rid of, despite checking the FAQ for the answer. If I save a job it won’t show in the app but will show on the website. The website is a whole ‘nother issue because anytime you do anything on there it forces you back to the app, so neither work. 

LinkedIn is a waste. My entire feed is recruiters wanking each other off or crying about all of the layoffs. Oddly enough all of the jobs I’ve applied at, none of them have looked at my Profile despite LinkedIn telling me “your profile has been shared” and my listing it on every application. So LinkedIn, what is the point?",2

Seems it was a an UI issue they finally resolved, thanks! Unfortunately, now I can no longer edit my activity all likes, comments etc show up on my feed. I prefer not to spam my connections and limit to specific, relevant activity. Hoping the next iteration resolves this...
Also be sure and check your privacy settings they added a new feature to collect your data for research if you do not want to participate you need to manually opt out. 

9/15 update all the below still exists except now profile is missing entire interface for profile and article views and search appearances. There is no value left to this app. 

I lost all of my saved articles, enough said. Everything else feels irrelevant after this loss but it seemed I had more ""notification alerts"" than actual notifications received essentially alerting on nothing or invisible items. Then again saved articles disappeared...is this a magic trick? :(

Still feel the same about the below items which have not improved over time...
I am not sure it could get any worse. Then again I thought the last update was terrible this latest update proves it can. Why change the order of the icons and their functionality at the bottom? Newsfeed was awful in last update now it doesn't fit the screen right on the 6. The previous update was ridiculous why does every app feel the need to turn into social media with a newsfeed and timeline. New interface is clunky at best. No area to view and change your privacy settings. Not a fan at all.",2

2021-03-07 19:07:12,Jobs feature needs a lot of work for usability,"I have been using the Jobs feature of LinkedIn periodically over the past five years, however, I have been using it weekly for the past several months in a concerted effort to explore and seek employment. There are some really frustrating (but seemingly minor) problems that should be addressed:

Filters - there should be a way to filter out keywords from posting results.  The jobs they sort for you based on titles or keywords are about 30-40% applicable. Being able to exclude certain sub-results by keywords, qualifications, or salary range would be incredibly helpful. 

Pop-ups - in the bottom left of the screen, there is a pop-up of the action you have just taken (save a job, unsave a job, mark a job as inaccurate or uninteresting, etc). They appear right on top of the list of results which means you have to physically acknowledge/click the x on EACH notification. Why???  I know I just saved that job ... I literally just took that action. What is the purpose of the obnoxious notification that I have to click to dismiss??

Applied - why is it so difficult to mark a job as “applied”?  This option should be part of the options listed when clicking on the top-right dots. OR just give me the option on each posting to click Applied so I can keep track. It is maddening to have jobs in my Saved list but not be able to move them to applied/keep track.  They just stay in my list and I have to go to the posting or external site to see whether I applied or not. 

Hide - when I hide a job because it isn’t applicable or I am not qualified (or the location is WRONG or misleading), why does that job keep showing up in future searches? This isn’t online dating. I’m not going to change my mind the more I see that option because I’ve become dejected and will just apply for any old thing. This is a bizarre glitch.  Hide should hold across searches.  What is your algorithm learning if you keep showing me what I’ve said I am not interested in?

There are other things that could make this feature so much better for job-seekers, especially those paying a “premium” price but these four things would have the biggest impact on usability.",2

2019-06-14 21:44:19,Used to be good. But it’s now sadly hot trash.,"I’ve been a LinkedIn user since it’s inception. I’ve been a premium subscriber for 6-7 months. Sadly in my line of work it’s a necessary networking tool but if it wasn’t  I’d get off this garbage train today. 

In the beginning it made sense. It was limited in scope and perfect for its purpose, it was a great (perhaps the only) professional networking site. I’m not a social media person and I only tolerated LinkedIn because while it was social media in the strict sense it didn’t engage in the soul destroying stupidity of other social media (FB IG etc).  It was an online repository of resumes and professional profiles, full stop. 

Now it has fallen into the trap of mission creep. It does a lot of stuff no one needs and likely only recruiter and HR “professionals” care about.  It crushes you with insipid sponsored  content that’s all offensively low value inspiration (don’t give up!!!), and an offensive amount of notifications linked to nothing of value.   I was pinged today by Linkedin to tell me that I had 13 “interesting views” of my profile. Like the dope I am I looked, intrigued “hmm. what’s an interesting view”. Well it was more garbage. Sliced and plated in new ways. It told me that the 13 interesting views were from “senior leaders” in my field.  None of them. Not one was a “senior leader” most are not even mid level followers.  Some of them have fancy titles (fooling LinkedIn’s Stone Age algos I presume) but really. It was a minute waisted and I’m dumber for it.   I realize I’ve taken longer to write this than the minute. But I’m hoping someone reads it. And thinks. Maybe we don’t need to be Facebook in a suit. Maybe we should go back to doing something useful.  I won’t be holding my breath.",1

2021-02-09 15:17:32,Astounding number of emails and notification badges,"I have never in my life used a service or app that I’ve found more disruptive or aggravating than LinkedIn. The default settings involve sending me 2-3 emails and a truly astounding number of notification badges per day. The notifications, especially, are for things no one could possibly have any interest in being notified about, like when my distant acquaintances are having their work anniversaries or news for some reason, as if a job-search social network is somehow also a newspaper? Essentially every time I look at my phone, there are one or more notifications on the LinkedIn app, and none of them are useful.

It’s like the management team of LinkedIn has been so immersed in working on this company for so long that they’ve lost perspective on what users care about and ended up creating a product that makes me want to throw my phone and computer out the window. “Yes,” they say, “she definitely needs a notification for this list of ‘Top People to Follow on LinkedIn’ to make sure she sees it right now, not the next time she logs on.” “I know we sent her an email about a job to apply to at 12:55am, but what if we sent her a second email about a different job to apply to, also at 12:55am. No, we can’t consolidate all the jobs into a single daily email; that would be anarchy!” 

I have now disabled all emails and almost all notifications from LinkedIn. (If you’re wondering why you’re not getting all these emails I am, it’s probably because your email provider is automatically filtering them as spam/promotions. Try searching “LinkedIn” in your email.) 

I hope LinkedIn changes it’s company strategy, but until it does I think LinkedIn will remain in the cultural imagination more a coworker than a friend. If you feel you must get the app, change the notification settings or that coworker relationship may soon become strained.",2

2022-02-18 02:47:00,Account setting won’t stay set,"I keep changing my account settings to no politics and yet there they are!

I don’t want political crap in my feed, I don’t want job postings in my feed, I just want a feed that is chronologically correct and not showing me posts from over a month ago. 

This app keeps getting worse and my previous feedback still goes…

-

Monitor the posts and comments better! This so called “business app” is turning into trash.  — Each update makes this more unusable. There needs to be a setting to take off the constant job postings if we don’t want to see them. Not everyone on there is looking for a new position or not IN the position to look for something different. I keep “hiding” the posts and it comes up and says I won’t seen them anymore but if I log back on or refresh a page or even just pick up my phone, there they are! LinkedIn isn’t what it used to be. It was built as a professional network and now it’s a lamer version of Facebook. The amount of non professional posts is bad enough plus tons of click bait posts...then they tried to add stories (not the place for it) but what is infuriating is the amount of negativity, hate and racist comments on posts! Keep in mind, they consider a “like” on a post a share. So now I see posts from people I am not connected with on my feed, many I’ve had to report because they are so inappropriate that I’ve had to block and disconnect from both the poster and my connections. If someone does post something positive and actually business related, comments are not monitored and for some reason this has become a platform where folks just lash out insanely at complete strangers. Too many political and us vs. them posts and completely irrelevant memes that have nothing to do with what this platform is for. Top it off, if you do post something relevant, don’t expect notifications of someone comments on it. I recently wrote an article and shared it to my LinkedIn. Was wondering why it seemed quiet when on the blog I posted it on had almost 3000 hits. Turned out people were liking and commenting on it on LinkedIn but I didn’t find out until I went to my profile to find the post! That’s another thing, the feed is ridiculous with the order of it. You will get in your “most recent” a mix of a week ago, a month ago, then a day, then (no kidding) FIVE months ago and then maybe, just maybe something from earlier that same day. I’m not looking for work but have a friend who is. I saw a job post and went in just to see what the requirements were. I ended up getting spammed with job postings after that. I’ve constantly had to close out suggested jobs and have emailed them stating that I’m not looking for work so please stop sending me postings. The suggestions for contacts is more than pushy and bordering on Facebook status. Just because I went to a school 30 years ago doesn’t mean I know a kid who just graduated from it! Oh and stop showing me people that I have had restraining orders on and have tried to block from my life! They may be connected to someone I know but this is what you do to people! Stop with the suggestions. If I want to connect with someone, let ME look them up! And when I do? Why do you have to show that I did? Not even Facebook does that! The only reason I stay on this site is for a few of the connections I have. But seriously this has gone so far downhill the last few years I don’t understand why it’s still around.",1

2019-03-20 10:22:15,Disappointed,"I have been on LinkedIn for years but was not actively looking for a job until about 6 months ago, at which time I upgraded to Premium. So now I’m paying that high price for Premium, but there doesn’t seem to be much in the way of return. Yes, I have been able to connect with a few more people, but that is not worth the exorbitant monthly fee. The jobs that are suggested by LinkedIn are usually far from a match. Whatever system you are using developers, you need to come up with something else. 

I also included the location of where I want to work, but I still get requests (not matches) from all over the world, including China. I am trying to get a job in Pennsylvania. That’s not anywhere close to China. I’m not sure what they recruiters are seeing after I set all my preferences, but it doesn’t seem to be working. 

The preferences that I set (actively looking, full time, job location, type of industry, etc.) are complétele erased if I don’t respond to two recruiters! I don’t understand why you have this feature. I don’t feel obligated to respond to poor matches. I travel for business which means I may be on airplanes or meetings and am not monitoring my LinkedIn app 24/7 to see if there have been messages from at least 2 recruiters so I don’t have to reset my preferences! This makes me wonder if the higher priority customers for you are the recruiters. It certainly cannot be job seekers - and yet I’m paying this huge amount of money for “Premium”. ?!

After 6 months of Premium, I have had zero meaningful interactions on LinkedIn that would be related to getting a new job. 

My recommendation to others is maybe use the free version of this app to connect with those in your industry that you can for free (don’t waste your money on Premium) and maybe read industry related articles there if you are not already signed up in your own industry websites. If that doesn’t interest you, don’t waste your time.",2

2023-07-29 02:18:23,No Security and Easily Hacked!,"Use Extreme Caution because I had 2-step verification turned on BUT a hacker was able to get into my LinkedIn and change that WITHOUT using the 2-step verification. When I was hacked I received 2 mails from LinkedIn with the first saying the 2-step verification was turned off and the second was a notification that it was turned back on. I was locked out and taken in circles by the app ending in them wanting me to provide them with sensitive personal information. Why would I feel comfortable doing that at all considering how easy it is for hackers to do whatever they want in their system? 

I can assure you that NO ONE is trying to impersonate me on the app - I am neither a high-powered executive nor a wildly successful entrepreneur 🙄 I should be able to reopen my account using the same email I have had for it since the app started. I saw on Twitter that users have submitted their passports and driver’s licenses WEEKS ago! I don’t want my sensitive, personal information in your system when it was so easily hacked! No thank you, that is too risky for me. 

And good luck being able to find a human being from LinkedIn to help you after the system takes you in useless circles lol. The “Help” and Contact Us links are useless dead ends and there is NO WAY to open a support request, even when they let you be hacked. 

LinkedIn’s frontline employees are obviously understaffed and overworked. I had to go to Twitter in order to get any response at all. And I need to add that there are hackers ALL OVER LinkedIn complaint tweets and Instagram posts offering to “fix” users’ accounts. So thanks for making your users even MORE vulnerable to hackers by forcing users to use social media to GET ANY TYPE OF RESPONSE FROM LinkedIn. How many users were taken advantage by these helpful hackers because you cut your workforce to the bone and criminals have taken over your social media sites? Add people back to support your business; it’s ridiculous that you did nothing to prevent hackers from making changes without authorization! That is very unsettling. 

I hope there aren’t a bunch of overpaid executives patting themselves in the back for saving costs by laying off most of the actual workforce. If so, don’t forget that the people [your employees] are the company. How ironic that the company that’s supposed to bring professionals together doesn’t want to communicate with us at all.",1
2023-06-16 16:46:45,Not for serious job seekers.,"I’ve been using LinkedIn for years, and I’ve recently come to realize that it isn’t for serious job seekers (plenty of online articles echo this sentiment). Over the years, I’ve filled out hundreds of applications and have had dozens of interviews. Great, right? Except for one thing. Not a single one of those interviews originated from applying through LinkedIn. My skills and backgrounds are pristine, and my education and GPA are untouchable. I prioritized my search on LinkedIn, thinking it was the best platform for serious results. 
What I’ve found, though, is this: 
1. Too many companies using lazy software that filters great applications out over minor technicalities. 
2. Too many companies miscategorizing their desired level of experience (e.g., labeling a post as entry level but requiring 8 years of experience plus a masters). I have 10 years of applied experience, a masters from the top university in the world in my program, and a bachelors, and I’m still having to include entry level jobs in my filters, which is absurd. 
3. Mass repeated reposting of the same position across multiple cities simultaneously to gain followers and mine data and that drowns out posts from smaller companies who are looking to actually fill a position. 
 If LinkedIn wants to continue being taken seriously, I’d suggest some oversight to monitor these posts more closely. There’s not even a way to report a post as having inaccurate filters anymore. I suggest using Indeed or just finding jobs that meet your requirements and directly applying on the companies’ websites without mentioning LinkedIn as the source at all.",1
2023-05-26 07:38:49,Frustrating Experience: LinkedIn App Not Functioning Properly,"I'm disappointed to share my recent experience with the LinkedIn app, as it has been consistently unresponsive and has displayed the error message ""Not working, please try again."" This recurring issue has significantly hampered my ability to utilize the app effectively for professional networking and job search purposes.

It's frustrating when an app designed to streamline connections and career opportunities fails to deliver on its promises. Despite my efforts to troubleshoot the problem, such as reinstalling the app and ensuring my device is updated, the issue persists. The error message appears frequently, hindering my ability to access important features and content within the app.

I rely on LinkedIn to stay connected with colleagues, industry professionals, and potential employers. Unfortunately, the ongoing technical difficulties have disrupted my engagement on the platform. It has become increasingly challenging to browse job listings, connect with new contacts, and even respond to messages in a timely manner.

Moreover, the lack of a clear explanation or solution from LinkedIn's support team has been disheartening. I have reached out for assistance multiple times, but the responses have been generic and unhelpful, merely suggesting the usual troubleshooting steps that I have already attempted.

As a professional who values the power of LinkedIn for networking and career growth, I find this recurring issue with the app extremely disappointing. It not only wastes my time but also affects my ability to seize potential opportunities and stay up-to-date with industry trends.

I sincerely hope that the LinkedIn development team addresses these technical glitches promptly and provides a robust solution to restore the app's functionality. As a loyal user, I would appreciate better communication from the support team, including timely updates on the progress of resolving this issue.

Until the app's performance improves, I am left with no choice but to explore alternative platforms for my professional networking needs. It is my sincere hope that LinkedIn recognizes the significance of this problem and takes swift action to rectify it, ensuring a seamless user experience for all its users.

Overall, my experience with the LinkedIn app has been frustrating due to the persistent ""Not working, please try again"" error message. I encourage the developers to prioritize resolving these issues promptly to restore the app's functionality and regain the trust of its users.",1

I would recommend the services from legal aid or the corner bum who claims to be a lawyer before hiring this firm. If zero stars or negative was possible that’s would I would give. I hope to post on every review page so no one else endure this type of cost and continued legal process going through the bar to get my money back from this firm. 

I would highly NOT recommend this firm for any type of work what so ever. Not only are so called ""fees"" not up front they don't keep a record or give you documentation throughout your case. When and if a settlement is presented they mention nothing of it for you can make an educated, informed decision when or if a settlement is right for you. So when you get you're check and you're short $5K-$10K or more depending on you're case and nothing explaining why. Other than the selfish mentality I can do what I want..call the bar. Expect a very hostile lawyer with no empathy and very passive aggressive mentality blaming you because they don't give a clear picture that they would easily give you’re money up to the bad guys.

Also don't be blindsided by mediation with this firm. When the bad guys call and want to set up mediation you can plan on paying every dime of that according to this firm! They cut the bad guys a break and forget to tell you that as well. Absolutely feels like collusion when you're not the informed party yet money is being taken from you!

I also claimed exempt on tax papers. Not only did mark yell at me and get mad because he thought exempt means I don’t pay taxes. He didn’t hold them to following that either.

You match me w/ jobs like design & architecture. I’m a director of product designer / UX which has nothing to do with architecture of physical spaces your either matching me because it has design in its title. But JD’s that actually match my job history descriptions and other key words don’t even register as a match. 

Once I came across a service manager job said my profile matched this nothing in the skillsets or JD was even remotely close to my LinkedIn profile.

Why don’t you hire skilled people instead for culture so the skilled people can actually solve the problem because your whole system is janky af and suspect to even trust your service. Maybe less promotion of switching to premium when you can’t even get a level of accuracy. 

Conversion to premium probably relies heavily on if the consumer can even trust your service. When you services are waaay off that equals a low level of trust. Stop trying to add new worthless feature like “skill test” that often aren’t even relevant. All the test I get are engineering test yet I work in the realm of UX Design who mostly don’t even write syntax. You can’t get the basics right start there and fix it.

2020-01-14 12:37:55,Absolute scam,"This app does nothing but show people’s complete and utter apathy for job seekers. Recruiters will read and ignore every message, companies regularly post positions for months and don’t take them down because they don’t have to, and every post is self congratulatory. 

The most pernicious part is the premium membership. For $30 They offer “insights” into how many people have applied, what degree they hold, and which companies hire from where. But all of this data is useless since the companies are not hiring from the outside. They work on referrals but asking for one through the app is pointless because it means putting their neck out for strangers they hardly know.

The only useful thing it offers are Lynda courses and while they are informative, they do nothing in the way of making you stand out in a pool of applicants. 

The best way to describe this app is false hope. They’ll dupe you into paying for an overpriced membership that does absolutely nothing to make you stand out. 

Some people might have had success but I’ve asked around and literally no one scores a job from this site. All it is is a professional Facebook, meant to make people brag about accomplishments that benefits no one but themselves. 

They’re worth $23 billion built on the desperation of job seekers who get nothing in return but rejection and apathy. Do NOT pay for the subscription and if you’re using this app for job searching, you’ll save a lot of time by asking your actual network of friends and family to refer you.

2018-10-17 09:04:49,Ridiculously Inefficient for a Virtual Social Media Company,"For a Virtual Technology Company, the fact that finding a “Help” or “Contact Linkedin” contact information is virtually impossible, so I now have to download your App, just to have access to this contact App Review page, in hopes that LinkedIn “might” respond or view this post is simply Ridiculous and Inefficient! As has been my experience with LinkedIn from day one, which is why I rarely, and barely use LinkedIn, and attempt to avoid using it. All I have ever experienced was frustration after frustration on your website, and previously with your App. The way that LinkedIn has its website (and I presume App) set-up, is in such a manner as to discourage (to the point of driving Users to Insanity), at all costs a User actually contacting LinkedI n directly for any assistance.

Although you are a virtual technology (social media) related company, LinkedIn as a company is about as Anti-Social (aka do not contact us, there is no contact information), as they come. Which would likely be forgivable, except their Website/Service is extremely inefficient, and it is routinely IMPOSSIBLE, to submit, revise/alter information in/on/posted and/or within their website or app.

FOR EXAMPLE:
My major burning question, which I have yet to track anyone down to address and who could potentially assist me?

•• HOW DO I CHANGE the “Twitter” address in my profile? 

Sounds simple right? Well, NO!, because the Twitter address currently reflects the Twitter Address of the company where I previously was employed. 

A simple “Edit” You say? 
Just go Under Your User Profile, Click on The Edit Your Details Information, You say?
Yeah, Riiight!, sounds easy enough, until you try it, and find out that the Twitter Field, along with the Twitter Name shown (of your previous employer) are BOTH GREYED OUT & INACCESSIBLE!!

Just contact LinkedIn Customer Service and Support, You say?
YEAH, great, let me know if You find any information on their website about how to contact them directly, and if you do find that information somewhere (Please let me know because I have yet to find it!!), and I can almost guarantee that search takes you longer than 20 very frustrating minutes!!

Unlike most technology based and customer focused websites these days, LinkedIn makes contacting them a struggle and an exercise in futility, I believe they expect and know, that you will eventually just give up! Where other CARING Companies and organizations either provide Users a “Contact Us” page listing their various contact email addresses, telephone numbers, physical mailing address, etc.., NOT SO for LinkedIn!

Other Websites/Services even occasionally provide Users a Website Contact Form to fill out and submit feedback, questions, etc...NOT SO for LinkedIn!

Other Websites/Services have links to Customer Support Forums, where App/Website Users can join a Community and maybe get help from other Website/Users who have face similar issues....NOT SO for LinkedIn!

Other Websites/Services who are strongly Customer Focused, even have integrated F.A.Q Knowledge bases that provide general help for common problems...NOT SO for LINKEDIN!!

There are even Websites/Service Providers who have integrated Customer Support Service, with Ticket Creation & Submission, that is trackable from creation to resolution, with the aim of providing Users a method to submit help requests and ensure that those requests are answered and resolved in a timely manner....NOT SO LINKEDIN!!

If you are noticing a reoccurring pattern, then you would be correct. As I stated, LinkedIn has done an ironically efficient job of making themselves and any contact with their company for assistance, a virtually impossible task!

Having said that, what is LINKEDIN good for?
•Maintaining a Public Business Profile
• Connecting You with targeted business contacts and/or networking leads
• Job Searching
• Keeping you updated on your Connections and Contacts employment status and location.
== Lastly, Heaven forbid You enter any information incorrectly, or that you run into some other bizarre and yet, completely common issue. (Like perhaps wanting to change some information you entered back several years ago from when you initially created your account, several LinkedIn website revisions ago! Because, if so, like me, you may find yourself unendingly FRUSTRATED by LINKEDIN’s lack of Customer Service availability!!

There was a point in time, where I believe that I may have made an optional choice about my profile or profile type, when LinkedIn was going through one of its revisions, which may have been the root of this ridiculous issue, that never should have become an issue; however, I do not know if my presumption is correct or not, because I can’t seem to communicate with anyone at LinkedIn to get help with, review, investigate or assist me with my problem (website information error!!)

Honestly, about 2-3 LinkedIn website revisions ago, they did have some LinkedIn contact information listed, but it ended up being to a non-native english speaking call center, that preferred contact through email only, and who had no clue about LinkedIn’s product/website nor even how to fix any User issues, and it was after that iteration of Epic Customer Service Failure, that LinkedIn seemed to proverbially, simply pull the ladders out of the water, and leave their Website/App Users a float in the sea, with no life preservers or assistance.

DEAR LINKEDIN:

PLEASE, PRETTY PLEASE, I am literally begging you, Please prove me WRONG! and HELP ME, FINALLY to correct the (seemingly simple) Error in my Profile!!",1

2019-12-04 23:32:58,Major LinkedIn Messaging Failures,"I love LinkedIn and use it more than anyone I know, but the messaging failures are frequent, repeatable and catastrophically bad. Of all of the social media messaging experiences one can have, LinkedIn offers the worst by a mile.

1. Pervasive InMail conversation failure. When sending InMails via Sales Navigator to recipients who then initiate a connection request (which are subsequently accepted) it is impossible to continue messaging. This actually happens a lot. 
I reserve my InMails for my most prized prospects and although I am flattered when they choose to initiate a connection request, I am reluctant to accept because in my experience, the LinkedIn interface won’t allow a conversation that started as an InMail via Sales Navigator to become a conversation in regular LinkedIn. I am also unable to initiate communication in such instances with a subsequent InMail, presumably because now since I am a 1st level connection with the recipient, I should be able to just send regular messages (but the interface won’t permit it- not in LinkedIn nor in Sales Navigator). In those cases, I simply can’t communicate and am completely unable to continue dialog which is a major failure seeing as those are typically the most valuable prospects I have.

2. Similarly there is a messaging disconnect when prospecting via Sales Navigator and identifying leads who happen to be 1st level connections. It is impossible to message them via Sales Navigator - the interface thinks for a few moments and then just errors out and says the message couldn’t be sent... I need to switch browsers, log into regular LinkedIn and send a regular message which is very time consuming and inconvenient (since that message will be stored somewhere else- away from my other prospecting messages).

The design is a failure and there’s nowhere to report it, so maybe someone will see it here... I’m not interested in crying to the user forum and I’m not interested in tech support. This is a major architecture issue that needs to be addressed. Worst social media messaging experience there is.",1

2015-12-27 04:42:02,Top Notch Network innovator,"LinkedIn is an enormous information and network of interconnected business professionals allowing anyone and everyone to ""link"" up with each other to prosper. I'd have to say this application and site has definitely improved from its original prowess as a connection between sales and entrepreneurs to a platform of inter-collaborating Information technology and general business professionals. A great digital highway for job seekers and hiring employers to meet and maximize bright minded, secondary educated, technologically experienced professionals. This is by margin's one of the best Business Networking sites out there in Cyberspace. They've done things right by starting early to create a networking site and now it's continuously expansive through many facets of corporate business linkage. A virtual business Buzz site with multiple ways to sell oneself and make known to others your own skills and capabilities. If you're on this site and not seeing results, get help, and find out how to utilize this application website. This internet domain is a virtual gold mine for anyone looking to get involved with business. Love the new interface within the website.",5

2014-06-19 17:09:37,Can't edit profile from iPad app. Ridiculous.,"I downloaded the LinkedIn app on my iPad, played around with it a bit, then realized there were a couple of changes I needed to make to my profile. So I tapped. I surfed. I swiped. I assumed that it was possible to update my profile from the iPad app, but that the necessary button was just hiding in some obscure place that I wasn't seeing. After all, I've been able to edit my profile from the app on my Samsung Galaxy for more than a year. So I Googled ""How do I edit my profile from the LinkedIn app for iPad?"" and was taken to a forum on LinkedIn's site...where I discovered it's ACTUALLY NOT POSSIBLE. Um. What? A LinkedIn forum moderator hopped on the thread (more than a month after the question had been posted, mind you) saying LinkedIn was listening and that she'd make sure to forward their  comments to the app development team. I would think profile editing would be one of the first functions the added--after all, if the purpose of the app is professional networking, wouldn't you want your profile to be the absolute best it can be? So in the meantime, I have to access LinkedIn from my browser in order to edit my profile, which means there's no point in my having the iPad app at all, as there's nothing the app does that the full site doesn't. So. I'll be deleting this memory hog until it actually does what it's supposed to do.",2
2012-05-06 11:48:31,A baby step forward,"I'm not as down as some reviewers on the UI.   The design aesthetic is very good, but I agree, the navigation is needlessly muddled.  Integration of contacts with calendar is mildly interesting and cool but while my calendar stays extremely full, I don't have enough meetings with ""cold contacts"" for it to be a regular or useful part of my workflow.   Similarly, the emphasis on updates would be more meaningful if more than a tiny fraction of my contacts chose to use LI as a place to share content.   

After a couple of years of use I'm still waiting for LI to give me more than a dressed up address book.   If the new features research were focused more on business intelligence I can use (and don't already know) by analysis of my network graph rather than trying to play catchup to Facebook or Zite/Flipboard, I'd take more interest.   Who are my most 'important' contacts (highly connected or at hubs in my graph, eg, who might be influence leaders whose relationship I should pay more attention to)?   Who's changed jobs recently (package this in a standalone section rather than mixed up with all updates)?   Are there trends in my graph, whether 1st, 2nd or 3rd tier (flurry of hires or transitions).   LI is sitting on a mountain of data, time to start using it and quit getting distracted with trying to be a 3rd tier social sharing service.",3
2017-03-13 16:36:17,Poorly designed app,"It's amazing how terrible this app is and how much worse it is each time it updates. First of all, replacing the ""me"" button with the ""jobs"" button is so unnecessary. If I want to open the jobs app, I will go to the jobs app. It's ridiculous that I can't reach my own profile at any screen, I have to be in my newsfeed for it. I can't reach settings unless I am on my own profile. And for the love of god PLEASE FIX YOUR NOTIFICATIONS. Seriously it's 2017, it's like a child developed this app. I never get push notifications about people accepting my requests, or people requesting me.. oh but I do get tons of notifications everyday to congratulate someone on a work anniversary. Really? Yes I care so much about who started a job on this day, who will it be today?! Whoo! Please think about it, it is the only notification that is going to happen EVERYDAY and it's the only notification that the app feels necessary to put an app badge for. I don't want badges for this! You have so many notifications settings and how is this not one of them?! Why is congratulating someone on their work anniversary the main highlight of your app? Also, when I enter my newsfeed I see something that catches my eye, but it automatically refreshes itself and even if I scroll down, I can't find it. Organize your newsfeed settings, let me manually refresh it. Get it together, LinkedIn.",1
2015-06-01 18:18:35,It's All Up To You To Make It Work To Its Full Advantage,"LI provides an opportunity to connect on a fairly astounding level , however it is up to the user to use it proactively to truly maximize its potential. Proactive reach outs, personalizing reach out messages, being active in initiating and participating in group discussions are necessary to get any results . However I feel that major changes to the tool such as not including user's new connections on the update feeds is not customer friendly and not a great idea overall. More options in settings should be configured. Also, there are too many challenges in the effectiveness and usability with InMail ---- ie, requiring knowledge of a person's email address (of course we all know the week around!); also I would like to see additional filters on Contacts such as being able to sort by more intricate industry filters, past employers/organization affiliations, etc. The app needs more features that the main site has , all along the lines of what I have noted here already .",4
2015-03-12 19:54:40,Does what you'd expect,"Nothing to scream and dance about, but I can with ease accomplish everything I need to do. Then again, I haven't been looking for a job in over 8 years, my opinions might change at that point.

The only complaint I have, is that the app always starts at ""find more friends"" when I click an approve connection link in an email. Listen LinkedIn - the last thing you wanna do is push people away when they're trying to expand their social network already. Several times have I closed the app because I just wanted to quickly approve a connection and then go back to work, not having to spend an hour going through ten social networks in hopes of finding more connections. Let's face it; if I was actively looking for a job, I would have done that already - not the 25th time that you're pushing this in my face. Software engineers are impatient people who love automation, this is not a way to keep users happy. Feel free to remind me with a big reminder box after I'm done, or if I'm logging in without coming through a referrer link with a task lined up. There's more, but I'll share that another day perhaps.",5
2017-01-24 12:32:48,The Business Tool That Re-Defines Communication,Rarely does one upon a unique business tool that serves a multiplicity of purposes from networking with existing colleagues friends associates and competitors to a communication platform that allows for The freedom of expression of use and the opportunity to hear others. The culmination of intelligence insight and learning that one can experience daily by only spending 10 minutes on LinkedIn is a highly unique and not worth the app that truly has changed the business community and open doors of opportunity for networking recruiting and just fundamental learning. Proud to be part of this ever growing community from the very beginnings. I am hopeful overtime but this Apple emerge with incremental features such as your current location available to your network to allow you to engage with your network who may be traveling locally and open the opportunity to meet with members of your network in various cities. Overall this deserves six out of five stars and keeps improving every day. Bravo LinkedIn,5
2012-04-26 12:08:19,If you can get past the login screen...it's great!,"I would've given this app a 4 or even 5 star review if I didn't get kicked out of the app 4 times as I tried to login.  On my new iPad, I was already logged into the older iPhone LinkedIn app and selected update from the iTunes store. After installing, I entered my credentials and logged in....I was able to get a quick view of the new home page each time i logged in but was quickly booted out of the app...on four different occasions. To overcome the issue and the reason I'm able to give this review is because on my fifth attempt I logged in and the split second before I was kicked out I was able to pick on the profile icon and overt my subtle ejection.  After logging into the application I must say that it is great to finally see that this app the way it's supposed to be on an iPad. I like the integration with my calendar and also liked the quasi-Flipbook like function that shows users posted articles or content by flipping the app from the right to the left.  After the problem I mentioned earlier I could see giving this app some where closer to 4 stars...there is always room for improvement. :-)",3
2011-08-17 15:36:31,More bling. More annoying.,"I'm a heavy linkedin user and I appreciate the attempt to overhaul and redesign everything from the ground up but I do not care for this update. I knew from the very first second when I was forced to watch a goofy unimpressive video and then brought to a home screen with 4 over-the-top decorative buttons to choose from. This version doesn't even load my own profile and I feel like there's way to much going on - so much so that it's hard to know where you are in the app and it's easy to get lost in profiles. It kind of bothered me how prominent the 'add to network' button was and i repeatedly worried that i might hit the button unintentionally and cause confusion on the recipients end. Maybe the intent is to hyper-connect but it's not working for me. Could I be greeted instead with a running list of activity similar to what the Facebook app does? That would be better for me. Linkedin is about knowing what's happening in your professional network and building awareness of self, businesses, and opportunities. It's not the kind of app where I turn it on and then want to decide what I want to do every single time. Instead, it should be showing me what I want to see like a live feed with deep integration into people's profiles IF I'm interested in digging deeper. Meh.",1
2017-01-14 15:02:49,Love this mobile LinkedIN app,"It is one of the easiest ways to stay connected with friends, Associates, and new Associates and/or possibly new clients. People who you touch your heart by their passion in their lives and work ! It is easy to like and leave a comment. Allowing you to stay connected with ease building your network of social acceptance and visibility. I have been a member for many years. I would not have succeeded in life without a platform that LinkedIn has provided us to keep us center stage and in everyone's eyes with this simple app. Thankfully I began using it and I love daily communication and seeing what new business articles that I want to read to grow my practice, and finding articles that support my personal likes and endeavors.  Kudos to LinkedIn for having the insights to find easy and simple technologies in endorsing our friends at their jobs and staying front and center as well. Love my morning connections writing and staying in touch! Give it a try, you will be glad you did! I know I am!",5
2015-08-11 17:01:04,Suggestion,"I use the linkedin app on a daily basis, find great content and it is a very good way of networking with industry peers, etc.

One small thing that is really annoying with the linkedin app (also happens in their PC url as well), is that once you are reading about some posted article and click to go there and are finished with it, when going back to the main linkedin page you lost track of where you were...basically you have to start browsing again from the latest news and it is very difficult to find again the place you were before clicking that link that caught your attention.

Another suggestion to improve is tracking and showing the activity of someone on his/her main linkedin page. For example you remember that 'Joe Smith' posted something interesting that you would like to read later on, there is no way of going to 'Joe Smith's' page and finding what he liked or posted in the past (track of his previous activity).",4
2015-12-06 18:25:23,Bad update is bad,"It is not an inability to accept change or ""hate"". It is a bad update.  As many reviewers have stated, this update is a step back, or a step in the wrong direction.  Bugs of course are inevitable in a major revamp, but even putting those aside, the app falls short of where it needs to be.  While I doubt LinkedIn will change course after a long and expensive update, it still needs to address the concerns of its user base.  

For me the user interface experience is less than ideal. One example, as a full sized iPad user, the lock to portrait style orientation is disappointing and gives me less freedom to use the app how I want.  Why take away options?  Furthermore, for me, the ""messaging"" update falls short.  The format is ok for casual conversations, for which there are dozens of free casual social network apps.  However, many of us use LinkedIn to be as professional as possible and that can mean a more formal email/letter style communication.  Additionally, the messaging system is less efficient for longer written communications.  

LinkedIn needs to forge its own path as a professional social networking site and stop taking its cues from the flavor of the day at casual social networks.",1
2015-05-13 03:04:12,Worked great UNTIL RECENTLY,"I've been using this app regularly for over a year, and I've had a flawless experience as far as glitches and bugs... but for the last MONTH or so, half the time it freezes up when I click on my own profile, the little blue wheel spins for several minutes, and then I get that annoying ""Oops something went wrong"" (durrrrr!) message.  This bug has been going on long enough that it really should have been fixed by now, given that there have been multiple updates since it started.

Also, it would be nice to stop suggesting endorsements for skills that I NEVER LISTED to my connections!  I have a crapton of endorsements for over a dozen skills that aren't applicable to me, but LinkedIn apparently thinks they should be and they appear in my connections' feed as endorsement suggestions!  How about only suggesting that they endorse me for the skills I DO list for myself?

And finally, it would be nice to be able to fully edit every aspect of my profile from the app, and not having to log into the website when I add a volunteer item for example, or even editing my interests.  But anyway, fix the freezing up issue already, and I'll add more stars.",1
2014-12-28 08:12:18,Sneaky Info Thief,"Besides the fact that the app has not been updated and looks bad on my 6 Plus, I could not get past the set-up page with the ""Continue"" button that wanted to upload my address book to the LinkedIn servers. There might have been a decline button under the ""Continue"" button, but I couldn't tell because my keyboard kept popping up and getting in the way. Luckily, I read most of the stuff I agree to, so I clicked on ""Learn more"" to see what I was clicking ""Continue"" for. I don't mind sharing a small amount of my contact information on LinkedIn, but there is no way I am uploading all of my contacts' info. That's a betrayal of trust. With all the recent data breaches, it makes me even more cautious. Needless to say, I force quit the app without continuing.

Edit: I opened the app, and it works without having to complete that step.  So I'm changing the rating from one star to two stars. The control is under Settings > Add Connections in the app. There are no instructions on how to remove your information from the servers if you accidentally uploaded it though like there is in Facebook's Messenger app.",2
2017-04-27 19:16:48,Thank you LinkedIn! I have always appreciated your service.,"For years I've understood, appreciated and used LinkedIn's capabilities and they keep expanding. I've always told people that once they understand what they can do with what they have, they will be empowered. That said, I find that having this app gives me a lot of access to a great deal of information - on the go. I appreciate the syncing capabilities as well. I also appreciate not being inundated with obvious ads. 

Without this app, I'd have to wait until I open my laptop to quickly and efficiently look up succinct and unique information for a company/entity/person or connect with someone I don't know well - in real time. That is like saying- I would need my largest camera (with all the lenses) to snap a spontaneous photo on the go. I don't. That said, there are additional features on my larger camera and my laptop that I can't access on my phone apps, but that's ok - for now.",4
2015-06-11 18:23:50,QA is weak - things break that worked,"I think it is essential that you have linkedIn as part of your daily life. At the same time, typically, developers for these kinds of apps should have a formal quality assurance process. But what I find with LinkedIn is that things break that once worked. So I believe that the ""kids"" programming this are not being managed by experienced people or those who value the LinkedIn user base. There's an in-app means for you to communicate with the LinkedIn support department, but you get absolutely no feedback.
A gigantic problem I have is this: if you write an inMail and it fails, it tells you it fails in a NEW screen, and doesn't give you an opportunity to copy and paste the draft. You completely lost your failed draft.
In general, sending mail on this app is a problem. Even the support mail functionality seems to go very slowly. Historically when it worked, it was very slow, I mean 45 seconds to maybe a minute AFTER YOU HIT SEND. Now nothing actually can get sent on an iPhone 6, running over a wifi Apple AirPort Extreme, running iOS 8.3, latest release of this app.",2
2017-02-14 02:50:27,"Better 2 Factor Auth, Features Needed","The whole 2 factor auth needs
rework into something that is more secure like with Google Authenticator. And you need to listen to recruiters and people actually paying for services. The whole work feed features like Facebook at old. I don't want commentary; I want real value added work features like ability to get work experience pre validated with somelike like GoodHire (too many people ""exaggerate their experience"". Recruiters should be able to search for candidates with pre-validated (aka true) profiles. You should be able to also get real recommendations that can be used (aka accepted by industry - and that have more weight / value when done by another validated profile). You should be able to find better way to network discretely with executive recruiters and even use the app to make interviews to keep search discrete. And many other work related features (so many I could easily list here that it makes me think your product team is brain dead). We don't want another Facebook. We want a work networking tool that rocks.",2
2016-04-17 22:09:49,"Great interface, terrible end-user experience","I love LinkedIn, it serves it's purpose very well and provides excellent opportunity for maintaining networks with co-workers, new acquaintances, and new opportunities. However, the overall experience it's completely diminished by two terrible aspects within the app and the community.
1. The app allows for people to write articles, many of which instantly capture my interest. But I can never get through any of them before ads overtake my screen, and quitting out of them removes the user from the entire article. Also, if not the ad, then the App Store will manage to repeatedly try to open up as well.
2. The community may as well be able to post directly from Facebook, whether it's incredibly bombast opinions or blatant trolling, I don't think a single comment section is without users who should receive 'Are you sure you want to post this?' pop-up before any submit.

I hope LinkedIn sees an opportunity to build a more professional environment for those with proper etiquette and respect to more easily share there ideas, and for those ideas to be accessed without meaningless interruptions.",1
2012-03-18 04:06:16,"Much prefer the real deal website, app is ok, no where near as good as the card munch app by linkedi","Hard to navigate but if you have the time to jack with it and fumble through the interface it is a good app.  Personally I think they have a great desktop interface and would have geared the app to closer mimic the desktop experience.  Oh, and it's not for you if updating apps on a daily basis is annoying.... It needs to be updated more than most of my other apps combined.

On another note, the LinkedIn card munch app is by far one of my favorites, absolutely ingenious!  A must for any business professional that is looking for a seem less interface to access all of your many collected cards without having to pilfer through mounds of business cards.  Just snap a picture of the cards within the app and upload, LinkedIn will put the information into an e-card while also storing digital images of the original card.  Freaking amazing app!  Done by the pros at LinkedIn",3
2016-11-14 16:34:59,Great update!!,"LinkedIn has made phenomenal improvements, with providing ideas to connect with your contacts, suggesting ideas to get your conversation started, recommending relevant links that have been found in the news. Quite frankly the best update I have ever seen from this app, all the negative review seem to stem from unexperienced users or ones having technical issues that seem more related to their phones then anything else. If this app is used correctly it can be a very effective business tool, and since this is a professional social networking app it is not uncommon for individuals who have the liberties of posting whatever they choose do so with political comments, however those political topics only alienate themselves from the rest of the community as one reviewer complained, so get over it and keep using the app as it's not to any fault of the creators of the app.",5
2015-03-16 02:15:54,Nice design but buggy and missing key functionality,"I appreciate the design of Linked-In's app, but it has consistently been buggy the entire time I've used it (e.g. screens not loading, loading incorrectly, messages not going through, etc.) The most recent example was a message not going through from one of my contacts, which was surprising. Also, perhaps I haven't found it, but I can't find where I'm able to view my sent messages on the app. I can on the desktop experience, and feel like it wouldn't be too terribly hard to do this on mobile. A conversation is between two people, and I only get half of it on mobile, and as a result lose the context of what has been discussed. There's also no indication that I have responded to a message on mobile, so I'm often left wondering whether I've gotten back to the people I've wanted to, and have to go on my desktop to check this.

Making these updates and reducing the bugs and glitchiness will greatly improve this app.",3
2017-05-25 01:50:25,TOO MANY POP-UPS!,"Here's the thing LinkedIn: you have a decent product. But I am seriously considering uninstalling because I am tired of your obtrusive and annoying pop-ups. Why do I have to tell you every single time that I login that I don't want to sync my calendar? I don't want to. I have no interest in it, and I don't care how much you feel it will change my life. I have an absolute right to make those determinations for myself, and your insistence that I MUST do it could lose this customer. 

I'm also tired of the other pop-ups in the middle of the site. I know that my profile is ""only 78% complete."" That is fine with me. Regular pop-ups that seem to be demanding that I provide more information are not making me more likely to complete it. They are annoying me and making me more likely to delete it. Same goes for the other pop-ups and intrusive indicators everywhere. 

Learn from the history of websites. People stopped going to websites that had annoying pop-ups all the time. They will tolerate them occasionally. But seriously, every time we login? For every page on the profile? It's too much! 

I'm totally fine with a little warning like Facebook provides that explains how to make the profile more secure or to get more out of it. Totally fine. Let me have control over it. It's when you are annoying me and getting in the way of getting information out of the site that you get in the way and start becoming an annoyance instead of useful.",2
2013-03-20 11:40:07,Program Errors,"After installing the app my profile displayed correctly with the different modules, and was able to navigate through the updates modules to read the articles.  The second day (today), there are no updates, the messages disappeared, and from the ""me"" module, I am unable to navigate to any connection's profile.  I did my best to resolve this by coming back to the module but with no positive results. This app is not working for me, so if it fails to function later today after I log out/log back in to clear any cache, and after I un-install the app and re-install it, I will go back to the desktop version from my iPad mini.  This app was convenient for me and the font was legible, but the frustration is not worth it.  I have the app installed on my iPod Touch but that's buggy and crashes often and takes a long time to refresh and execute commands. I've just installed the mandatory iOS update on my iPod Touch, so maybe that may help the crash/freeze issues there. Please research and resolve all these errors; this is a good concept and saves me steps from accessing my profile from the web.",1
2015-09-27 20:37:43,Unintentional connections,"When a pop up screen pulls 1000+ suggested connections from somewhere (even though I chose not to sync any of my address books or emails) and then as I'm trying to close the screen sends all those invitations out, I ran to the help on the site to find a solution. And there's no way I've found that I've been able to actually cancel the invitations, despite reading help articles (that point to icons that don't exist for me) or emailing support.

There's never a need for me to connect to 1,000+ people at once. Any value of this app is completely offset by such an irrelevant feature. Now I've sent invitations to a) people I don't even know who were somehow in a contacts list of mine somewhere or b) people I intentionally didn't send invitations to previously. Maybe there were a few connections out of 1000 that I would have liked to have but now I have to sort through a whole lot of random connections and spend days pruning back my connections list to where I had it before.

2014-12-27 21:24:22,Great Business Tool for Networking,"Linkdin allows me and my company to be in front of other professionals in a forum that's non harassing. People that network with me understand what I do, services I provide and have access to me when they need me without constant barrages of advertising and sales calls on them. I posted notice on my contact profile that only serious business interest contact me via LinkedIn and not abuse it as an avenue to sell me. Only a few have used the contact info to cold call me for sales so most respect my request. I simply delete any connections who abuse my contact info. The articles posted by other members are very informative and helpful. I look forward to posting some helpful insights from my industry for my connections to benefit from. I highly recommend Linkdin for any who want another helpful avenue to expand their business reach.

The app does not offer options to update my profile, view my contacts' activities, or edit my account information. This app only allows you to view the current status updates and view your profile or your contacts' profiles. There is no option to view jobs or open positions available through the full linkedin web site. Searching is limited to any updates made on a computer. This includes searching for contacts or people in general, including groups. There are no options to make updates on your phone. This app also allows you to receive messages via push notifications and to reply to messages. I gave it two stars because searching contacts' activities, jobs, and editing my profile and account information on the go are extremely important for me and this app does not offer the options to perform those functions.",2
2015-12-12 20:20:20,Absolutely horrible update!,"LinkedIn's update has had real life negative implications for my ability to network with other professionals. I usually send out 2 connection invites every day. When  an invitee accepts, I immediately send a ""thank you message."" This approach has led to the development of some very good relationships with contacts. With the current version, I do not receive any notification when an invitee has connected with me! Consequently, I now need to write down the name of every person I've invited, and search through my contact list to see if they've accepted  the invitation. (By the way, who's'Genius idea' was it to alphabetize professional contacts by first name!?) The result: finding out if someone has responded to an invitation is hit and miss and tedious. My ""thank you message"" to the invitee may be very late or never have the opportunity to be written if I don't find the acceptance of my invite.

The update's user interface is a confusing mess.

LinkedIn, please take to heart what so many reviewers are writing and go back to the previous version of the app.",1
2014-10-05 11:56:46,"Great network, bad app","LinkedIn is an invaluable network, but its app and UX is buggy.  Most frustrating example: When I receive a request to connect via email on my iPhone, I click on an action button in the email message which then triggers a web interface asking me if I would like to download the app - to which my response is no! since I already have the app on my phone.  I wish it would simply open my existing app automatically when I click Accept from within the email message.  At this point, I typically then open my app separately and the app often does not contain the connection request that I received via email.  Yikes!  It's maddening and a waste of time and frustration. With that said, the LinkedIn network and concept is so powerful, I will begrudgingly deal with the challenges of the app itself.",4
2016-01-02 04:29:59,New LinkedIn Version Needs Work,"I've used LinkedIn as a staple for my continued network development and career growth for the past few years.  However, this recent version is very disappointing.  The circle photos make it much harder to make out the likeness of people as compared to the larger photos available in the previous version.  The contacts list is organized by first name.  For people like me, it much easier and way more functional to manage contacts by last name.  Lastly, the menu set in the previous version was much more intuitive.  This version has options that are hidden and hard to find.  It's as if the developers wanted the platform to more resemble the Facebook app.  Instead they should be focused on how to enhance the user experience to maximize people's use of the app for ongoing business and career development.  I hope the developers are reviewing these more recent reviews to see how improvements can be made prior to the next version release.",2
2012-06-07 19:14:27,Horrible Steps Backward for LinkedIn,"On the surface, the LinkedIn iPad app is pleasant looking; however, many good feelings were washed away when I tried to navigate my way through the app. Besides feeling cluttered and somewhat haphazardly organized, the amount of content areas that were inaccessible proved to be very frustrating. 

These disappointments, while unfortunate, pale in comparison to the calendar integration issue. It may not be clear to many people which calendar they are selecting to view within the LinkedIn app, and to have an application pull in personal information without full disclose of what will happen with this information is irresponsible. Sure, some people may find it useful to access an iCal calendar from within LinkedIn, but the app doesn't appear to give users a clear method to select which calendars appear prior to their appearance within the app.

I wish I felt differently as I've had positive experiences with LinkedIn in the past, but I would recommend that any current or potential users stick to the LinkedIn website.",1
2009-12-31 10:46:53,Please Unleash Your Potential Linkedin,"First off I appreciate the Linkedin team putting work in on the iPhone app. With that said you guys are moving forward while taking steps back, flailing your arms around. This app does not present a polished UI. Frankly it's quite ugly and the user experience calls for to many basic steps. I don't want to just criticize your work but I really want to go back to the old setup and may forgo the new features all together.  I'm starting to think perhaps this app isn't showcasing enough overall ROI to warrant proper attention.  

Hell I'd be glad to work with your team and just give you some of my ideas. I reached out early in the year so I'm shocked that this is the upgrade we've been waiting for. I sincerely hope that the marketing, business development and engineering teams realize that you're not living up to your brand name & perceived brand value. Come on Linkedin we know you have more potential than this!",2
2013-10-06 03:39:58,Failures Abound,"The app would be a nice, professional alternative (and, in some cases, a compliment to) Facebook. Unfortunately, it simply has too many failures.  Notifications repeat without explanation. Eliminating those notifications (on the first or subsequent occurrences) requires drilling down into multiple layers of the UI.  The incessant notifications are painfully annoying and distracting when looking over the phone's home screen containing the App, showing a badge counter that never goes away permanently after 'clearing' the notification within the App.  Adding insult to that injury is the badge count being consistently incorrect.  It will report '14' when I only have 2 notices.

On the subjective front is the info-overloaded UI, and the metropolitan/city/urban backdrop on startup - not all of us live in that environment.  That image alone makes me less inclined to use the App; I'd prefer something less polarizing and much more pleasant/pleasing to my rural-loving, business-minded eye.

I cannot (and consequently do not) recommend the App.  Just my two cents worth.",1
2016-04-25 18:07:01,Love LinkedIn,"I love LinkedIn, because it is a useful media tool that allows us to not just learn more about our business, but opportunities, and make resourceful connections with possibilities; but to grow in our careers, our beliefs and as an individual by posting pictures comments videos we've been sharing some of our favorite ones from other individuals and businesses... Lord knows I take full advantage of every opportunity to post or share something to Encourage someone in never quitting, entrepreneurship and philanthropy. Lastly and just as important, to inform everyone about the condition of our nation and world, and suggest things we can do to make a change for the better, especially to have a voice in Voting; even if it's against my own views.

My HR manager suggested for me to use this app to help me stay professionally connected with the Team I was leaving back home and find new opportunities here in Texas! I am so happy I did I found the Company I currently working for thru this app and have received many offers in the past few years. I been with Igloo for almost 4 yrs but it is always great to hear there more options if I ever decided to leave and switched careers.

I also enjoy how easy it is to share an update or to write an article and publish it. I am not a professional writer but being able to publish a few pieces on LinkedIn have added to my professional reputaré. I wish the newsfeed was completely chronological but I believe the app has tools to let the user adjust how the newsfeed is sorted, I just haven't used them yet. Overall this is the only app I use for professional networking and I like that it permits for me to separate (somewhat) my professional contacts from my other social media.",5
2015-09-01 23:50:39,Poor product design!,"I have noticed many serious issues with LinkedIn. And many of these are not software bugs, though some are. There are many serious design issues that have major negative implications on users (in my case, a paying customer). For example, timestamps of messages sent within LinkedIn and the email messages they generate to users can be substantially different. This is serious, because often the body of email has statements like: ""see you tomorrow"". ""Tomorrow"" can be a different day depending on which notification you look at, within LinkedIn or the email sent by LinkedIn. This very thing happened to me and I caught the issue at the airport, just before boarding the plane to go to a meeting that I though was in a few hours, when in fact it had been the day before! 

Another issue I have noticed many times is that frequently when you type a lengthy message to send someone, send operation fails and you lose all you typed! Very frustrating!",1
2013-03-30 03:47:28,"Love the app, but needs small fixes.","The app is great. BUT, the process of getting linked with someone is quite ridiculous and should be much easier. 

For ex : when I click on someone's profile and then click the ""add link"" button, it asks for an email to send the request too. What if I don't have that persons email? How am I supposed to let them know that I want to connect with them? You guys should make it where all someone has to do to connect with someone is to press the ""add link"" button and then that should send the request to the person they want to link with. Which still allows for the receiving person to verify whether or not they want to connect with that person.

2016-11-17 03:32:07,Not Useful,"This rating is for the app, not the actual site. On the App, there's only a news feed now and other people's likes, very much just social Facebook or just a news app. This is not useful to find contacts and new jobs, it feels just like a news feed app, not a networking organization anymore, at least on the app, the site is still good. But on the app, important notifications don't show up, like new people to view your profile. Doesn't show who your contacts add as new contacts, which I feel is very important to know to network with people friends and colleagues know and can introduce you to. Constantly tell you, you have updated but all it is, is more news on your feed, not helpful for networking, time management, and finding contacts.
While I do like the industry new, it feels overwhelming on the app over contact information that I'd rather see and be notified about instead.
The site and LinkedIn in general  is a good searching tool for friends and colleagues.",1
2013-03-29 11:17:26,Linked in Links do not work!,"I signed up on the website somehow to get email updates from some of the groups I belong to. The email is sent faithfully every few days, with links to new articles or postings. However when I click on those links, all I get is a screen asking me if I would like to download the app, which I already have. If I click "" no thanks"" the screen goes nowhere. If I click yes that I want the app, I am taken to the site to order the app that already have, and so I click open but I just get the home screen. I cannot find the article that I wanted to link to at all. And the only search engine available is to search for people, not articles. And there does not seem to be any easy way to unsubscribe to these annoying emails with links that don't work. Perhaps Linked In could call upon one of their own connections to find someone who can make this app work. Right now it's nothing more than an annoyance.

2016-09-21 03:55:24,More than JUST a resume,"What I love about LinkedIn is that it gives me a platform to display all the skills and attributes that aren't found within the black and white pages of a resume. It's not so much that it allows for employers to put a face with a name, but it allows for them to explore a little bit of a potential employees personality. I have a lot of education and many different skills and abilities, and I am lacking  in job experience, but, I am not lacking in knowledge or know how. I recommend this app to anyone who is seeking new employment or just wanting to connect with the other genres and learn some things! Don't be afraid to connect to people you don't know and ask questions.... I actually just got hired from a job I found through LinkedIn!",5

The screen shakes annexes of the application is about to crash. If I am  dictating  a recommendationthen the screen does not allow me to see all of my text. Therefore not allowing me to understand or be able to see where I left off after pausing and are reviewing.

2013-01-17 00:38:41,Pathetic!!,"The LinkedIn application for iPad does not provide the actual number of connections under YOU when the connection count is over 500 . . . It simply gives 500+.  I have to go to my iPod Touch or my computer to find my actual connection count.

Under YOU, there isn't a alphabet index to quickly move to a given alphabet section.  It appears you have to scroll down through the various connections to find a given alphabet section.

Under All Updates, mixing the LinkedIn Today Updates with Connection Updates is a big waste of time and space.  There should be an option to review the Connection Updates separately.  

I submitted these concerns months ago and NOTHING has been done to correct these deficiencies.   If I want to find my number of Connections, I have to go to my iPod Touch.

I liked it and read though about 1/3 of it at what point i was interrupted. I haven't noted the author nor the subject.  It was about hiring an A-class employee.  Now as I went into the app a few days later, it briefly showed me the page I was reading, then refreshed to the Home without ever asking. I cannot find the article by scrolling the posts. The search function is useless.   Very disappointing, LinkedIn!  Your UI and for functionality never made a complete sense to me. The way your app is designed just proves the point. Despite it heavily relying on online content, it is also an awfully heavy app. Over 250Mb just for an interface to the website? Thanks, but no.",2
2013-05-30 11:59:39,Useless,The LinkedIn app is useless. All you can do is view profiles and read/send emails. Maybe for some that's sufficient. Not for me and a lot of the other people who have been complaining all over the interwebs. Why can't i update my profile? That seems like a basic function that is most frustratingly missing from this app. I can't even login via my browser because the company INSISTS on making me download the app when I already have it and can't do what I need to with it. How about making the app more functional before blocking users from logging in via browser. Or let us login via browser if you're going to keep the app at its most basic and least functional/useful. The app should be as dynamic as the website or close to it allowing users the basic functions. I think i am going to delete it because it's pointless for me to keep it on my iPad.

The gradual tweaks and improvements have made the use of the service more attractive and more enjoyable, but there is a lurking problem, which I have tried to communicate to the Company, yet I've received no response and the fix has not been addressed. It is the frequently and automatically displayed list of suggested new contacts, some or many of which have already have been my connections. It is embarrassing to send a repeat connection request to one's active contact.

I will drop this app, and use the web browser, at least until they destroy that app.

Perhaps it is time to start looking for an alternate to LinkedIn as I think this latest release demonstrates how out of touch they are with their users. I know I never asked them to create a portrait only app, and remove all the great features of the previous versions.

I've noticed over the past week or so, LinkedIn has launched a user campaign to boost positive reviews of its app. It's sad when they spend more time trying to save a terrible app, than just admitting they made a mistake and revert to the easy and well liked interface. 

I compare this to the Coke Pepsi wars. LinkedIn is Coke and they decided to surrender and change their formula to better match Facebook ""Pepsi"". Hopefully they will soon realize the error and go back to their original formula that everyone loves. Otherwise, LinkedIn has admitted Facebook is better by copying the interface, so why not just use Facebook. Maybe Facebook will jump into the mix and start adding professional features to their site and bury LinkedIn.",1
2015-12-12 20:01:28,Pontiac Aztec,"The new LinkedIn app is akin to the release of the Pontiac Aztec. Both are esthetically ugly, clunky and lacking any reasonable degree of functionality. 

Why do I mention the Aztec? Well it was a terribly ugly car to be sure, but it also represented that something was terribly wrong inside GM. I think it could be the same with LI.  It seems the company has lost touch with what it's brand, charter and attraction was all about. Since joining in 2003 I have seen a lot of changes, but nothing as incoherent as this. Only a company with a lack of focus, mission and perhaps even competing factions could come up with this mess. 

What will be interesting and telling is what happens next? After Pulse, the updates turing the home page into a mindless mashup of banalities and the overall ""facebookization"" of the platform, LI could be facing its next issue, something much bigger then a bad app. LinkedIn could be facing the relevancy questions. Is it, or can it still remain relevant to its core demographic?",1

This level of action alone deserves merit, I'm upgrading from 2 to 3 stars. Still lacks but at least they're listening & show it. 

App gets less productive with each update. As with Pulse, LI jobs etc,  the search feature is so basic & limited it's almost useless. Save feature doesn't work, has given ""error"" message for eons.  Frequent error messages as a whole, crashes, lack of features across the board. No option to open full site necessary for some features in a pinch. Obnoxious ""hands tied"" experience.",3

It's one thing to let the world know when I add a new accomplishment, versus changing my photo or connecting to someone. Also, I could thank LinkedIn for being the liaison between me and my first interview in Miami, but ""THE PLATO GROUP"" doesn't need to be anywhere on LinkedIn because it's bogus. They label themselves as sales and marketing experts, but selling government phones to financially challenged people is nowhere near real selling and marketing. But, I blame LinkedIn for allowing companies that don't really offer anything to potential employees. Companies should be screened first or at least have some type labeling that says ""Legitimate"". I didn't think I would see so many negatives, but there does need to be a serious update. LinkedIn has so much promise. Please get it together.",2
2011-09-17 15:58:09,Version rollback please,"Have been an iPhone user for nearly two years, however this is my first AppStore comment having been compelled to provide feedback for the new LinkedIn app. Please rollback to the prior LinkedIn app. This version is UNUSABLE to say the least. 

It does not support the following features supported in the prior version:

-Synchronization with iPhone contacts (must have)
-Bluetooth ""bump"" feature (must have)
-Ability to ""star"" a profile as a favorite (must have)
-Ability to search for colleagues and contacts (must have)
-Level of contact 1st, 2nd etc (must have)

At it's fundamental core, LinkedIn is a professional networking social group where users can search for, find, and connect with other colleagues and contacts. This version inexplicably fails to provide even these most fundamental of features where the prior version provided these. As a software  project manager and business analyst, it is a surprise to see such a popular networking application make it to release void of its fundamental core features - especially given the current climate of social networking competition where an alternative network always seems to be around the corner. 

As a user of theis social network, I'm inclined to delete this version and begin considering alternative professional social networks if significant improvements are not made in the near future.",1
2017-01-17 05:21:05,Used to be great,I loved the old version of this app! I used it daily on my train commute and it never crashed. If I had an interview I could easily look the person up online. If I made a connection at a networking event I could connect with them on the spot via LinkedIn using the mobile app. After this recent update the app either crashes or says the profile I'm searching for is currently unavailable. It also doesn't refresh my newsfeed so the same stories have been in my feed for a week and the new ones aren't loading. This is a huge disappointment because this was one of my favorite apps and now it is useless. I will say that if I go through safari and use the browser settings it is okay. It doesn't offer error messages when looking people up but it does keep prompting you to get the app which is annoying because you'd love to use the app if it functioned. Hoping the LinkedIn team fixes the app soon!,1

I got a call from an old family friend whom LinkedIn was repeatedly emailing because I supposedly invited him. Did I? Hard to say because they intentionally make the prompts confusing. 

I'd also like to point out how irritating it is to have to dismiss all the prompts for ""expanding your network"" and ""finding your other contacts"" everytime the app is updated. I want the option to opt-out and I want user-friendly navigation along with straightforward practices. Is that too much to ask? LinkedIn seems to love walking the line between user-hostile/deception vs doing the right thing for your users.",2

I incorporate it very naturally into the course of my business transactions on a daily basis, and the more time I spend with it, the more it gives back to me multiplied tenfold.

My advice is to give in and let it have access to all of your contacts - high school, college, career, and common interests. Make it part of your daily habits to connect with people you meet. From there you can grow and expand a legit network of business contacts. (I never accept an invite from someone I don't know and I now have over 2,000 contacts in my network.) Fantastic app!",5

I would have trashed the laptop by now if I didn't need it for LinkedIn and a couple of other choice applications which SHOULD WORK ON THE iPAD!!!

I don't get it.  Everyone is going tablet these days.  The iPad in particular is a fully functional computer, and yet some applications whose business relies on tablet users--including company career sites like PeopleSoft--don't work properly on anything but the old fashion computer.

Pretty soon, those of us who have come to prefer using tablets for all of principle computing needs are going to suffer the fact that our laptops wont be useable forever.  We don't want to buy another laptop just to make up for the software engineers' laziness, so either they need to make these things work on tablets--as they certainly can--or Internet cafes are going to have a major resurgence of customers frustrated by the lag of software behind hardware.

Why is it that the video game industry, and just about every other computer heavy industry, keeps pace with the hardware, but companies like LinkedIn don't.",3
2013-07-27 13:46:08,Disappointing,"Look - the LinkedIn for iPhone is pretty solid. It's easy to navigate, and use to make connections or research companies before interviews. The iPad version on the other hand is clumsy and unintuitive, with a weird centralized hub as its home page that is as pointless as it is isolating. I simply don't see why they needed to split your profile from your updates so thoughtlessly. From there its a buggy load time stumble to either section during which I've drawn out my iPhone and keyed in the info already. 

Look, the app would be a lot stronger if it resembled the customizable two column layout from the iPhone version. I guess they figure most professionals use LinkedIn from their iPhones and the web, but it feels like they are not even interested in changing that trend to encourage on the go or at home iPad usage of the app.",3

There's no way to sort the comments in chronological order and I can only view newest first and have to spend forever tapping ""show previous comments"", and can pretty much never see the first comments.  How silly is that.  Can barely participate in discussions.  Comments don't post, and exiting the app and coming back in, or tapping somewhere else in the app (both usually by accident) kicks you off your location in the discussion/comments, and you have to start the process all over again.  There's all these people willing to connect or share their knowledge but this app limits me.   As for job applications, jobs I've applied for (I apply on the web mostly), do not show that ""applied"" status on the app.  Whatever.",2

I recommend Frederic Warner.
I hired Frederic 6-12 months ago.
Frederic handled my Criminal Defense matter.
I have previously worked with 1-2 lawyers.
My review regarding Attorney Fred Warner, 
was and is a Great Criminal Attorney. I recommend him highly to anyone that has a criminal matter pending against them. He always kept me informed regarding my criminal case, he was always at every court hearing, and afterwards he took the time to update me where we stood with the court. 
At the end of my criminal case after I finished with my obligations that the court charged me with. Mr. Warner had the 2 Felony Charges dropped to misdemeanors and then had the whole case ""Expunged"" 
I believe his experience of 40 years and his wisdom in Criminal Law was the Arcane in my Criminal Case ""SUCCESS"".

2013-08-15 03:33:16,Decent,"This app offers very little functionality. Very often I am forced to use the website versus the app.
It is excellent for keeping in touch with your connections, as well as finding new ones. The app also allows you to read the articles, which can be useful and entertaining.
You CANNOT, however, search for, and apply to, jobs - this is my biggest issue with the app, as those are the main things I use LinkedIn for in the first place. You also cannot edit your profile or write recommendations for anyone else. Another issue is the complete lack of ability to interact with the professional groups and participate in discussions.
These are serious functionality issues which need to be addressed before this app is a decent replacement for having to use the actual website we all downloaded this app to get away from in the first place.",2
2016-11-01 12:37:35,Mandatory installation of the app,"It has been apparent that businesses would preferred you to use their app than to actually use their website.  For those of you that don't know what I'm talking about when you click on the site such as LinkedIn from your phone it has writing ""download our app now"" and in really small Microscopic lettering below there it will say ""or continue to our website"".  Now LinkedIn has given up on the ""choice"" approach take in the communistic approach that you install their app to even go to their website on your phone. Some of us do not want your clutter on our devices.  Nor do we want your software having access to our friends, our phonebook, our photos and etc.  Which we all know that is exactly what you were digging for. What happens when your sign is packed yet again and this time they have access to even more information that you should not have?  DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP!",1
2016-06-01 00:49:51,It's my constant,"I gloss over my Facebook but LinkedIn is my go-to throughout the day to stay connected with my colleagues. The app is stable and functional, the people I'm able to connect with are usually professionally relevant, and it's an indispensable tool for my career.

You have to stay engaged to benefit from it - and if you have a job with limited professional networking benefits it may not help at all. But I've gotten a new job within 24 hours just by updating my employment status after an unexpected layoff a couple years back.

In a world where we spend about 75% of our time with ""work friends"" having a work-appropriate social network is great. This app makes that work naturally.",5

Also a way to mindmap and interconnect contacts much like TheBrain software so you can sort and connect connections by industry or other filters and make insightful connections that you can capitalize on making strategic human capital decisions and find out relational connections based on what you're task is. For example if you're a startup that would like to know all the possible connections that can help you find the best possible investment connection. And all the interrelationships between connections that can help you see the potential in your existing network as well as your 2ndary. 

A visual interface like TheBrain would be brilliant.",4
2013-02-14 15:34:15,"Great website, really bad app","The app is just way too limited and it crashes way too often. Let me set the record straight, the LinkedIn service is great, but this app is a sorry excuse for a product. View the app as a complement to the website,and not a replacement, and you will begin to understand the frustrations with using the iPad app. You still need to visit the website to perform fairly routine functions and search around, you need to go to the website to do anything beyond basic messaging and review of your invites or even edit your profile. 

If all you want to do is read basic updates or post basic updates, the app will work. If you really want to network and review details on a contact, give the app the boot and go to the website. It is only meant to complement and not replace the actual website. In this day and age, that just isn't good enough.",2
2012-05-25 01:36:39,Lame,"Since I use LinkedIn daily and my iPad constantly, I was anxiously awaiting this app.  It has been disappointing that three generations of iPad have been released and all this time they only had the weak iPhone app.  My questions to the designers.  Is that all it does?  I was hoping for some functionality.  I can't even see where to edit my profile or upload a new picture.  I also use groups and manage a group and I couldn't find that either.  Does this app even do that? Or is it just a glorified email client and basic calendar.  I would expect the greatest professional networking site to have connections to talented and creative app designers.  I am very disappointed.  For now, I'll just stick to interacting with LinkedIn through the site and my email client.  What a waste.  I hope they didn't pay too much for designing a weak, functionless app.  BTW - they sure pay a lot of people to pad the reviews.  Shame linked, shame . . .",1
2013-12-16 21:13:35,Great - Needs One More Thing!,"I use this app on my iPhone and iPad every day to remain current on all things LinkedIn. It’s a wonderful in nearly every way and the developers continue to make meaningful changes.

Every LinkedIn person I know says to personalize your connection requests by removing the standard ""I'd like to add you to my professional network on LinkedIn” phrase with something that shows you took the time to connect in a more purposeful level. They say that hitting the “Connect” button is tooooo easy and that many who receive the canned connection requests simply delete the requests. Ouch!

The IOS versions of LinkedIn needs the ability to customize the connection phrase and NOT simply send the default phrase when the “Connect” button is pressed. For those of us who do take the time to write personalized connection requests, it’s embarrassing to use the IOS Connect.

I hope the developers will consider allowing ME to decide what connection phrase I want to use. Otherwise, this app is much less functional and I’ll have to wait until I’m in front of my Mac before making those all important connections. 

Thanks!",4
2012-04-29 16:09:53,A huge disappointment,"This new iPad edition is now useless to me, and I must resort to using only my iPhone version, which is thankfully not yet adulterated, as I refuse to update it. In this version, the updates cannot be filtered by connections or even chronologically. Fictitious ""colleagues"", really just excuses for ads, clutter the page. Many of the articles and updates are also now just ads.
To make it worse, detailed profiles are now presented erroneously. Some of my current positions are listed as previous. Is LinkedIn not aware that busy professionals frequently have multiple positions?
You cannot correct the errors.
The entire update seems to be designed to push sponsors and advertisers at the loss of accurate and accessible user information.
I am retaining this app only to see if a quick redesign update is offered.  After that it will be gone for good, its time is running out.  I am sad to see LinkedIn sell out this way.",1

2016-10-24 22:25:14,UX Fail: Finally gave up after years of faithful use.,"I've been a big fan of Linked In for years, but watching the app deteriorate over the past year (or more) into an obnoxious overzealous gatherer of information was finally too much.  In an age where having a trusted app installed on people's phones is so much more valuable than hoping they remember to come to your website, they finally jumped the shark.  Big User Experience mistake.  Trust is hard to regain.
I put up with constantly increasing notifications about things I could care less about (and that had nothing to do with their core goal of connecting people); but every time I open it the past few months, there are countless screens to click through to say ""No stay out of my contact list."" Etc.  So I finally deleted it altogether.  
Too bad really, because it was a good service once.  Maybe I'll remember to log in to the website once in a while.",1

It was just a simple app with most of what I needed right at my fingertips! I used to be able to see how many LI contacts I had and to check on their status with two taps or clicks....So what happened to my favorite app? This is a huge disappointment!!! In order to find everything I used before, I now need at least two different LI apps...maybe even three. Change is wonderful, but in this case LI messed up. This new and ""improved"" app cheapened the product by giving the user far less than what the old app offered. I wouldn't recommend downloading this LI app. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED THAT I AM ABOUT TO DELETE LI FROM MY PHONE AND MY LAPTOP!!!",1
2010-07-19 20:21:27,Destroyed my Apple Address Book,"I thought this app was kind of cool at first.  Then last night, while using it on my iPhone 4, I decided to look through my LinkedIn Connections.  Little did I know that the LinkedIn app started (in the background, without my knowing it) SYNCING my LinkedIn Contacts with my iPhone Address Book. 

I now have duplicates and corrupted entries all through my Apple Address book on my iPhone, MobileMe, and Mac.

How could this happen? I don't see ANY setting anywhere in the LinkedIn iPhone app or on the LinkedIn main website settings that allows the LinkedIn iPhone app to AUTO-SYNC my LinkedIn Connection with my Apple Address Book contacts on every MobileMe device I own.

What's worse is that there is NO WAY to get any support on this product.  You can't telephone LinkedIn, they don't respond to emails to their support team, the forums are impossible to find, and if you CAN even find them, they have only a few dozen people posting questions (which are rarely, if ever, answered).  How could such a GIGANTIC Internet portal with an iPhone app have virtually NO customer support?  I've gotten better support from single-employee iPhone developers.

If you value the contents of your Apple Address Book, do NOT download this app.  It will sync to your Address Book and destroy it.",1

They lied to get me to their site, or sent a generic email to everyone. 

But my region was United States. Surely updating that would be good. So I did. San Francisco Bay Area. There. Save. Oops. must have selected wrong. Still US. Again, Bay Area. Save. Region: United States. I am determined. I tried 5 times. It's broken. 

Then I looked back at the email. It shows me in the Bay. So attempting to update industry, which was unnecessary, cause something else go wrong. So now I'm a nationwide doula. Ha! Hopefully at some point I will remember to correct it when I am on a computer.",3

About five years ago, my professional circumstances changed and I needed to promote myself and network with colleagues. I really discovered LinkedIn at that time. It provides a dignified forum where a person can essentially have an online curriculum vitae, provide information to others about one's professional activities and accomplishments, and find others who provide services which benefit themselves or their clients.

I don't understand why it was necessary to take something simple and make it unnecessarily difficult and cumbersome, but the reviewer who suggested the old Windows Vista team designed it may be on to something. One of the things I particularly don't like is that updates like work anniversaries and new jobs no longer show up in the timeline. Also, once you review them under ""My Network"" you can't get back to them. All you are left with is a list of  ""People you may know"". If I haven't added them, they are not in my network.

I simply must search for it.  If someone who writes the Ap would just use it a couple of times, I have no doubt this could be an easy fix.  It would remove a great deal of irritation and frustration.  It would also improve the rating and usefulness.  Please fix it.

Additionally, I am very disappointed that some of the information available in the old application LinkedIn application like contact count, etc. is not available in the new iPad application.

One suggestion I have is to include a feedback mechanism to LI where users can directly share with you what new features they would like to see or challenges they are coming across.  This should be a subtle feedback button on every page so that users don't have to go look for where to provide feedback.

Developers have had plenty of time with iOS 9 in their hands, and from my testing, the LinkedIn App Extension, crashed on every single version of iOS 9 and 9.1. I have not been able to post to LinkedIn for well over a week now. This is completely unacceptable. If you're wondering why the amount of posts you are receiving has gone down so much, it's because your app extension is broken. FIX IT ALREADY!!!! Also, just FYI, the LinkedIn iPad app still leaves a lot to be desired, and does not give you an accurate profile view, because it does not show all the same info that even the iPhone app, or web interface does. Fix that too. I could keep going, but that should be a good start. I have also done a clean install of iOS to confirm my findings too.",1
2017-04-09 12:36:52,LinkedIn App is great,I was surprised to find that half of my contacts had reviewed my updated material and when I looked to see what they had been looking at I as even more surprised that they had somehow found my website of one of my businesses and I had never even put the URL there only mentioned the name of the main company and somehow my main company's app had grabbed the best part of their site for my customer viewing which offered a great sales pitch for some of my favorite products! I'm still mystified as to how it all came about and thoroughly pleased and excited about the entire process and with the LinkedIn App! Thanks Linkedin!,5
2016-07-07 18:56:32,Poorly designed GUI and usability,"I don't usually write negative reviews and normally give the benefit of the doubt to the App designers.  However, the new interface of LinkedIn is so poorly designed with such bad usability I wish I hadn't upgraded. The previous couple of GUI redesigns on iOS were poor but this new I think sets a new standard for poor screen layout and usability. I sadly find the My Network page, which I use most often on my mobile, particularly confusing and difficult to use, with all the overlapping notification taps that you have to discard individually. What were they thinking!! I am finding myself using my LinkedIn iOS App less and less and just waiting to get to my laptop, which defeats the purpose of the App in the first place. They clearly missed the whole idea of iOS simplicity and usability.",2
2013-07-01 11:17:17,"Unproductive, 3rd rate browsing","This app is not a productive way to review updates from your network or from LinkedIn.
Articles and updates you've read continue to clog the view.
There is no way to make them disappear.
A couple of noisy contacts or groups create a ton of spam. In my case these are recruiters posting about their openings multiple times per day. I assume they've paid LinkedIn for premium memberships that allow this sort spam-like posting. This drastically reduces the value of the app. Need a way to filter this spam short of dumping those people as contacts.

I often see interesting articles, but the browsing experience is 3rd rate. First, you go to an initial browser/reader view that shows a portion of the article. If you click 'view original article', then you go to a LinkedIn captive half browser that has very limited ability compared to the many first rate iPad browsers. To get back to the updates view you have to click two different actions on two different parts of the screen. The view showing the initial portion of the article seems like a waste, but it is a total waste having to go back through this view after you've viewed the full article. 

The app is very slow it takes a long time to pull in updates.",1
2017-07-17 18:38:32,Annoying pop ups and irrelevant notifications,"It seems every time I open this app, it has some annoying pop up pushing a part of LinkedIn that I don't care about. I clear it and then tomorrow it comes back!! How many times do I have to tell you I don't want to connect my gmail account or I don't want to add a mobile number?! These features don't provide me any value and only let you creep into my privacy more than you should. 

I seem to have no control over my notifications. I get notifications that someone in my network posted or commented. I'm notified when someone has a work anniversary. Who cares?! Notifications should be limited to invites, direct messages, or mentions. Stop trying to tell me what I should be interested in and let me tell you. 

LinkedIn is too pushy and is willing to push their selfish agenda at the expense of user experience.",1
2016-10-04 07:07:51,Glitchy,"Slow to upload photo - had to try nearly 10 times for it to save it correctly. Opens up to blank pages frequently when trying to fill in my personal info. Freezes on pages as well. Tried adding a friend several times but it would not send the request, however, after perusing it this morning, found he's been added. (Might I add, I attempted these requests a few weeks ago and have been checking it periodically ever since to no avail) Not sure how reliable this is for prospective jobs given the numerous technical issues, but will give it a shot. I'm sold on neither the Internet version nor the app. It is a great idea, but feel it needs some time to fine tune and work out the glitches, especially if this wants to be a resource for the professional atmosphere.",2
2015-05-19 11:54:28,"Useful app, and can improve still","I find myself using it for networking. I don't get annoyed when people cold contact me either. It's not a SPAM haven. I do wish there were more filtering type options in the jobs portion of the app. For profiles, I wish there was an option in the experience section to deal with being a contractor as many of us are. We should be able to state our employer and list the projects, companies, or accounts that we work on while being able to associate with their logo. Today, most of us state that we worked there, which is a misrepresentation, but we want the association. Other than that, it just grows on you the more you use it.",4
2014-10-21 21:42:15,"Suiz says ""Well designed, but not very useful""","I have been on LinkedIn for a while. The service is required for basically anyone who wishes to progress up into the corporate world. That being said, this app needs help. While the interface is well designed and pleasing to the eyes, it contains several flaws. A major flaw being that I can not edit my profile at all on this app (and if there is a way, it's not explicit on where without requiring a heavy amount of google searching). On a website in which it is essential to update your profile information on a regular basis in order to let other potential employers about your skills, availability and contact information, it seems that should have been the first thing they made sure was easily accessible to all users, both new and old.",2
2014-05-30 12:50:46,App is convenient and fully functional,"The Linkedin app always works well on my IPhone. What I like the best is that my email Linkedin notices connect to the app when I want to connect through the email to send messages to my contacts or view their profiles.   This is unlike some apps that don't recognize or connect with the mail links. As a result, the email link goes to the vendor website directly where you may have to log in or you can't view the website well with your phone. They basically take the convenience out of having their app on your phone. 
  It is Thumbs on Linkedin app from me.",5
2012-02-15 18:20:57,THe app that wont stop bothering you,"This app wont stop with the push notifications. I personally do not enjoy getting push updates on my phone from any social media app, so I have push notifications turned off. Unnecessary push notifications interfere with whats important - texts and calls, the functions that the phone is meant to do, and the notifications that you actually need. I have checked and double checked every setting, and turned off every notification everywhere, and I still get messages from this app! The most useless push notifications telling me to check out whats new since I last checked out the app a week ago! I had to delete it. this app is very frustrating and annoying, I would not recommend it. Unless you like receiving unnecessary push notifications on your phone.",1
2011-12-10 18:18:40,I like the Linked In Site But...,"There should be a few things added: like FB link on your profile, find connections using your contact list on your phone as well as on FB... And the adding a connection should be easier, instead of having to go search for your friends email in order to send them the invite to connect on LI. I'm just saying the app is made so you have easy access via your mobile, so the application itself should be easy to navigate, and have necessary things added to it... ;) overall love the app, a little improvements would make me happier",5
2013-05-19 20:30:42,"No stars, but I'm forced to give one.","I cannot get the updates to reload. I cannot view my group discussions and the homepage shows the same thing for a week, when I know things have changed. It will not alert me when someone has messaged me, not will it alert me when someone has requested a connection. It is challenging to request a connection. It purposefully FORCES me to use the app when I attempt the full site and the full site keeps crashing, anyway. 100% useless. I have never reviewed an app before, but I will review this one. This is the worst app I have ever used and I completely love linkedin normally. Incredibly disappointed.

Also, I cannot search jobs, and the ""jobs you may like"" have never changed. They have been the exact same terrible choices for which I have no qualifications for over two weeks. Why can I not search for my own jobs?!",1
2016-03-18 06:31:20,Metareview,"I am starting this review at 5 stars under benefit of the doubt. Every time the LinkedIn app asks me to review it even though I've already reviewed it I am going to edit this review and drop 1 star. If this review hits 1/0 stars (whichever is the lowest allowed), you will all know that Apple and LinkedIn and every app the nags you to review them is flawed and should be deleted until they remove this stupid nag screen. 

I hereby formally opt out of all requests and review nag screens. If I deem your app worthy enough or crappy/frustrating enough to garner my time and my review I will do so, asking me to do so is pathetic and disgusting and upsets me. Thank you for your time. [/endrant]",5

Stage freight and deadlines are dark little hidden fears of mine, yet, I am a writer, it's something I need to move past and quickly!

2015-01-12 16:36:06,"Getting better, but needs work","Been using app for several years and have definitely seen improvement but it's not there yet. One thing I find super annoying is when I get a notification in email from a group or a curated set of articles, the app struggles to get you to the link that was in your email. Given how much I work from my phone and read/review sites like LinkedIn during my downtime when not in front of a computer, I find this lack of functionality/comparability between platforms frustrating. Please fix!  Beyond that, toggling between your profile, stats on your profile, articles on the main newsfeed and groups/other stuff could continue to get better but making moderate improvements.",3
2012-05-06 22:22:14,WARNING:  UNINTENDED INVITATIONS ARE SENT!,"Learn from my frightening mistake!  Although I recommend people don't use the ap until this problem is fixed.

If using the new ap on the iPad be warned when visiting the ""People you Might Know"" area.  I inadvertently sent out a dozen requests to LinkIn with people, but I didn't even realize it was even happening.  There is no warning message, no question  on how I know the user (like on browser version), etc -  the request to LinkIn just flies!  When you are browsing names,  of course your fingers are scrolling on the screen to see additional names.  If you accidentally touch the small grey box to the right of individual's name when scrolling - you just sent them a request!!  This is a serious, serious design flaw.  

I can't believe others haven't written or commented about this yet, as there are serious implications with this flaw.",1
2017-07-15 15:11:56,Worst APP Ever! DO NOT DOWNLOAD!,"First time ever writing a review because this app deserves a poor review! The app sent me a recommendation to update my job history (which I had already done but the app did not register Changes) and once I updated my job history, it posted and send notification as feed on my wall as a recent job change. I tried deleting the changes but I am still getting congrats messages and my CO's HR is looking at my LinkedIn profile to see how I am posting a new job. I tried closing my account but it says I will delete all the endorsements I made to my employees and contact. Such poor process! I work in a very high profile role for a fortune 50 company and this damage to my reputation because of an incompetent app is irreversible. Shame on LinkedIn team for making this so flawed especially when dealing with professional business profiles.",1
2017-04-05 14:22:10,All features not available in app??,"Yet another app that requires you to download more apps just to access all of the features. I should be able to look at my groups in the app, not download a LinkedIn Groups app. There is really no reason to have a separate app for groups unless it's to manage your groups. I cannot access them unless I use the other app, or an update shows up in my feed. This needs to be changed. 

The app overall looks and works much better than previous versions. I am still receiving notifications that I have turned off and don't want. I don't need a daily notification suggesting people to connect with. I also don't need to be prompted to import my contacts each time I open the app to find new people. Please fix these settings.",2
2014-01-12 16:05:41,Use of application,"I use  this app daily sometimes as much as 10 or 20 times a day.  As a business owner it's a handy way to keep up with my industry and my peers As well as find perspective future employees 
LinkedIn  has some limitations in my opinion but it's not relative to the application.  While the application can be glitchy and LinkedIn has probably been hacked and the contacts distributed to junk mail industry overall it's a good program And I consider it worthwhile. It beats running around eating rubber chicken dinners every night.  It's better exposure and it's a better selection of contacts quicker faster better than the way we used to do things.  That's what I think.",4
2015-08-22 18:51:43,A Professional Toolkit,"In short, I enjoy the app and the many benefits it delivers. Mainly, it really is the next best thing to a contact if you only know names. In my case, I use my profile as a second online CV and just another URL to add to onto my resume. The ability to follow companies is a nice touch as well.

As far as recruitment opportunities go, the advertised jobs are usually second-rate contractor opportunities/FTE where the agency takes a massive cut. If you have the skills, don't pursue jobs on here- you'd be selling yourself short. Plus, you can usually cross reference parts of the advertised description to an original listing anyhow.",5
2013-09-05 16:48:35,Could use some tweaking.,"I love the ability to have my professional  contacts in one place. I don't like the fact that everytime I get an email, it routes me to the Internet and sign in, even though I am constantly signed in on App. It would be nice to have a small balloon that shows up on the app when you have a message or request. Also, I think the Business and Premium upgrade are RIDICULOUSLY overpriced. I would spend that much for the year, but not per month. It also limits what skills you can choose from. I have more than one type of training. I would love to be able to showcase that additional training, but there is no way at present.",4
2012-10-13 20:53:27,Needs Improvement for Serious iPAD USERS,"As a very active and longtime LinkedIn member, and someone who has written numerous magazine (both print & web-based) articles that address, among other things, the value of LinkedIn as a SM outlet, this app continues to fall short, which is disappointing considering the quality of ALL other aspects of the LI organization, from recruiting solutions, functional groups, etc.

Ever try writing/posting comments which may contain more than a sentence to a post? Lots of glitches here ... IPAD keyboard continues to pop up and down when trying to place cursor within ones comments for edit and/or addition. In short, doesn't work. 

Functionality in managing ones LI Group as Owner/Manager - remains a significant opportunity. 

I could go on, however for sake of brevity, and recognizing the significant trending of the iPAD as a primary solution for business professionals, LinkedIn need to start taking its app more seriously, as well as beta-test its features to bugs prior to the 'rush to release' update(s).

Until then, while I can do a few things with the app, I'll still be forced to use Safari for majority of what I would just assume do within your application.

Hope these comments are read and taken seriously.",1
2014-11-26 20:06:39,Clunky. Unmanageable. Pointless.,"Review is for the iPad version. App is very non-intuitive and is not user friendly. Very frustrating to use and missing a lot of common sense features such as ability to view calendar with no ability to edit or add items to the calendar. USELESS!  No ability to write or view recommendations on the iPad app. Viewing group updates via the newspaper style layout is very frustrating. They don't seem to be organized in any logical way.  This is a very frustrating, nearly pointless version of LinkedIn. Badly in need of a common sense overhaul.

Still no improvements. This is one of the worst social /networking apps out there. They either don't care or don't know how to improve their app. Maybe they should link with some new developers who can revamp this mess.",2
2014-01-26 17:35:35,"Great service, Unstable App","Let me start by stating that I get a lot of value from LinkedIn.  In general this app is well considered, but problems remain. First, it is wildly unstable.  Many times I'll open it and it will crash while updating my feed.  When it gets into this state, reopening the app doesn't help.  It will crash repeatedly until something changes on the server side.  Second, the design decision to hide certain key information in the app, such as a contact's email address. This is easily available under ""contact information"" on the browser version of the site, but not available in the app. Obviously they want communications to go through their site, but this is not always appropriate for me.",3
2016-01-19 05:48:58,Sharing links outside the app,"Generally if I'm reading an article and that's not in the LinkedIn app, I press share and share it I instantly. It still allows me to share on Facebook and Twitter but LinkedIn has disappeared from the list since the update. Trying also to see if this is an iOS issue. Overall I do like the changes to UI. I haven't wanted to get premium because I do believe there should be student pricing but I used to be able to see the titles or workplaces of people who were looking at my profile and now I no longer get that option with the update. Bummer :(
It'd be nice if someone can get back to me on the sharing feature though.",4
2013-02-04 17:27:45,"Missing a few functions, but can be fixed","This app, as of now (Version 5.1.6), is still missing crucial functions. For example, not all information on your profile that you filled in on the desktop site is listed on your mobile app. For example, there are sections (such as volunteer experience, courses, awards, etc) that I've worked meticulously on, but does not show on the app. I've enabled my settings on the desktop site to show this section, but I've checked my app settings, and there wasn't an option to check or toggle this. When others use this app to read my profile, or anyone else's for that matter, I hope everyone would agree that you'd all want to read the full profile.",3
2010-01-30 18:48:19,"Decent, but some functionality probs","Works as expected, but a few things that are very annoying. 1) the GUI and widgets break iPhone ui conventions: the inMail should feel like mail. 2) this is horribly annoying: the app allows people to 'send' you their contact info, which they expect you to add to your contacts list. But if you don't want to add them, there's no way to decline! You're bullied into adding them if you want to get rid of the red counter circle. And why would I want to add them anyway, that's what linkedIn is for! Please give is the ability to decline contact addition. 3) these 'themes' merely allow you to change the color of the buttons. Big deal. That's not a 'theme'. But whatever.",3

This is by far the most underutilized social media sales tool on the market. When I explain to coworkers, and friends the ability I have to see who's viewed my posts, what their titles are, and where they geographically came from, they are blown away. 

The only change that would make this 100%, would be if you could see who the person was that actually viewed the post, and not simply from what company.",5
2015-07-13 17:31:33,Excellent Tool But App UI/UX Needs Work,"I really like the concept behind LinkedIn. I've been able to do far more networking and have had far more opportunities come my way than I would have without it. However, the app itself is not my favorite. I would say the animations and information architecture are ""clunky"" and confusing to new users especially. There are a lot of extraneous menus that I don't feel are necessary and it creates a convoluted feeling throughout the app. That being said, it's definitely worth having for the networking alone. If you're a professional in practically any field who is interested in networking with your peers, you should be on LinkedIn.",4
2015-12-14 10:47:34,Don't see the value after the update,"To be fair, I probably don't use the LinkedIn app as the company would prefer. I don't use it to see other's posts and engage daily with articles and witty antidotes.  There are plenty of rivals that already do that. I used this app to check on companies, connections, jobs, and see who has viewed me. Connections seems to be buried so deep that I no longer see the value in having the app.   It's way harder to look for jobs and I don't want that crappy job search app.

Update-12/14: I just realized that with this change, I almost never use the app now. My only usage is to clear a badge notification for an alert I care nothing about. I was in the app 2-3 times a day previously. I think I've been in there 4 times total since the update.",2
2017-09-08 02:58:57,Improving!,"The LinkedIn app for iPhone has slowly, but surely, improved from being pretty stationary app (little to no editing capability) to a more functional social media app with statuses, profile updates, and engagement with content. It's great for professional connections, skill development (Lynda/LinkedIn Learning) for a fee, and you can even apply for select jobs through the app. Like all social media, this is a for profit company that gets it's money from your attention, so expect to see advertisements and click-bait articles from companies that want your eyes. If you can get past that, this tool could be a great resource to finding that next career step.",4
2014-12-14 01:55:29,Limited Choice of Skills,"All I wanted to do was add SSRS to my technical skill set, having recently written two reports, one textual and one chart, for a client. I ended up adding the information to my job description as President of Abstract Development, LLC. The hope is that, on a future visit, the LinkedIn app will have parsed that text and recognized SSRS as a technical skill. That is a convoluted way to have to do what could be done with a combo box or a selection tree. It is also more than a bit presumptuous for the LinkedIn app developers to think they know better than a programmer with forty years of experience what skills ought to be on his technical skill set. I will not even broach a similar topic in my other profession: economics.

Otherwise, the app seems adequate.",3

The general app is good about getting the message when someone has either contacted you or requested to be a connection, but the overall layout and organization of the app is not very user friendly. If you are just browsing through your connections or just want to make sure you receive a message as soon as possible, then this app definitely accomplishes that. However, if you're hoping to find an app that replicates the website, allowing you easy access to news, groups, connections and potential jobs, then this app might not be what you hoped.",3

How will I know that I replied when there is no reference to a reply in the inbox?  Where do I click to see sent email?  If I have an invitation to connect pending and I look at the requester's profile, it asks me to connect and doesn't know there is a connection request pending.  Bad design...bad navigation...very unproductive use of valuable time...

Don't waste your time.  Instead of LinkedIn giving away iPads to every employee maybe they should have paid for iPad training.  Waste of corporate money!",2

Compared to other complex apps I'm using this one is equally intuitive in design, easy to read and navigate. It seems ideal for use in traveling. Not sure what all the fuss is about unless it turns out the iPhone 4s is the only OS it was really designed for.",5

Update has some great new features but is harder to find info like people who have viewed your profile. Love the network updates but wish you had the option to like or comment on job updates or anniversaries vs only having the option to send a generic congratulatory message. As someone who recently updated a position I received 55++ messages saying ""congrats hope you're doing well"" from colleagues who most likely wanted to acknowledge the update with something smaller such as a like or comment but app directs you to inbox.",4
2015-07-10 03:04:37,Shady business practices,"Due to my company's request I signed up for LinkedIn Premium account for almost $1000/year to help with recruiting.  Last year, Premium Service was not needed anymore, and I tried to cancel. Should have been easy as it is advertised as ""cancel anytime"".   However, not so, and I was unable to cancel last year. And this year, I was charged for a second time, another $1k!   Called the credit card company and claimed a ""fraudulent charge"".  Even though there is no phone number or contact email listed anywhere on LinkedIn, someone contacted my credit card company and ""validated"" the charge, so here I am charged another $1000 for another year!

Warning: if you sign up for a ""premium service"" make sure you find a phone number or email first where you can contact someone to cancel the crevice when needed.

I'm a writer, so this section was actually one of the more important parts of my profile. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the accomplishments you show (and this section was also buried under the useless skills and endorsement section.

And for seeing who has updated profiles and new connections. You can also initiate and accept connection requests, post status updates, comment on others', and ""like"" items. One thing that bugs me though is that when I receive an email from LinkedIn (e.g., a connection request) and I click a link in the email, it takes me to the LinkedIn web app and pops up an alert saying ""Dontcha wanna download the iOS app?"" I already have the iOS app. I wish the email links would take me to the app instead.",4

It cannot for the life of it load pages, articles, or profiles. It really shouldn't take 2-3 minutes for someone's profile to load. Another issue, which is less of an issue and more of an annoyance, is the constant suggestion to try and get me to upgrade to LinkedIn premium for free for a month. I don't want it, I've never shown interest, and I always dismiss the invite, so please stop asking me to sign up. I also don't need to be taught how to use the app every couple days upon logging in. Show new users a tutorial on how the app functions, but please don't show it to me once or twice a week. 

Get your act together LinkedIn.",2
2012-08-13 05:48:45,Great,"Great, straightforward app. Its simple and practical layout is exactly what it should be. For everyone who might be frustrated that you cannot edit your profile, I hear you but LinkedIn must have a reason for that. I'm guessing it's because, at least in part, because that would allow people exactly what apps do- provide on the go accessibility. That would mean people could more readily change their profiles if a certain meeting would would benefit. Not that everyone would do it, but including myself most probably would! Just a thought.

People on here giving it poor ratings are clearly looking for another Facebook, which is just not the case. I'll admit the $50 a month for premium usage is a tad outlandish, which is something I believe LinkedIn should change. Overall though, it's a weapon in your arsenal to go beyond surface marketing.",5
2017-06-07 21:02:48,App crashing all the time,I am using this app in my iphone 7 plus now. Last month had a problem the app was not opening. Everytime I tried to open it crashed. Then I got annoyed and uninstalled it.  Then install it again after a week. Cause I needed the app. But the problem I face then was the app was not aigning in.  Even after trued opening a new account.  Then tried for another week and then it got an update addressing some issues and bugs. After that it was okay. Then again from last friday the app started crashing again. When I press the app icon it shows the page with the linkedin logo and crashes. Every time.  Just now updated the app again.  But the problem is there. Please do something with the app. Thank you,2
2014-05-07 14:33:59,Decent but needs improvement.,"Probably the biggest flaw of this app is that it does not have the full features of the website.

The biggest flaw is that you can't write a message to a new invitee as you can on the web. Related to that, anyone can simply try and connect to anyone without the need for an email address. I find it very frustrating when complete strangers that I have absolutely no relationship with want to connect with me without even the courtesy of an introduction I or explanation.

Also I find the ""recent updates"" feature does not always reflect your activity even after a few days have passed.

It would also be nice that when emails of group posting with links to conversations that are of interest would open the app directly to the conversation rather than connecting to the web where you have to log in first, and then sometimes have to find the conversation anyway.

On the flip side of that coin, it would he nice to have a way on the app to stop receiving notifications of conversations that are no longer of interest.",3
2016-05-10 20:04:39,Good Stuff,"Great tool to stay in touch with coworkers and clients. I've had the same job forever so I can't speak to its job recruitment abilities. If you want to see what company your coworkers or clients moved to and chase down work or a new job, this app is the one to use. What I've learned in the last 15 years is business is about people not contracts and POs. This app allows you to track and communicate with the people behind the paperwork. Every upper management professional should have this app and a profile on it for maximum exposure and information in the digital future we currently live in.",5
2015-09-20 21:54:41,What the Hell is this crap??,"I have no words to express such a horrible app. What do you think is right in this app?? Let me mention a few which I felt are wrong with this app:

1. How do I view my sent messages or even search in messages?
2. How do I search for a company? The new app update just allows users to search their connections and not even companies or job titles.
3. How do I manage my privacy using this app? There is this title in the settings screen which says "" Privacy and Security"" but all it has is email/ password/ number change. Where I see privacy settings here? Please use right terminology.

If someone can write a book with title ""How not to build an app"", they will surely mention this app as an example. 

I am a huge fan of all the opensourced Linkedin libraries like DataFu and all. But being a core tech company with such a good reputation and huge market cap, I truely expect a better product from Linkedin. Linkedin has got good talent to make better apps. Please try to fix the user experience or it would certainly be visible in the active users count. 

I will never recommend this app to anyone. 

Sorry for the harsh words but its truely a crap from a $25+ billion market cap company.",1
2016-05-23 20:06:57,Wonderful and necessary,"I don't write reviews often, so hopefully just my taking time to write this goes to show how important LinkedIn is to me as a tool for professional development. I love that I can keep my professional information updated on LinkedIn, and use that profile to fill out job applications and connect with new peers and acquaintances. The only thing preventing 5 stars for me is the UI, which is nice and easy enough to use, but doesn't strike me as being quick and simple enough; at times it feels a bit busy to me, which seems nitpicky but I want to be honest with my feedback. Essential to my iPhone experience!",4
2015-12-16 01:39:21,This app is clearly way better than it used to be.,"Seriously, the old app was garbage as far as usability and design go. The navigation between your profile and your feed was super confusing. It used to show a square with the content of the last item in your news feed as the button to go back to the news feed. That made no sense. Now it's super simple, it's just a tab view. The messaging is also so much better. It used to be a super ugly email rip off and now is basically just messenger for talking to other professionals. Also way way better.",5
2015-12-05 03:32:39,Ferociously Bad Update...,"...to a perfectly serviceable app.  Why does this update feel like a really poor beta version of a 2010 phone app?  Really? No landscape view anymore?  Why can't I find anything?  And why is this app now ENDLESSLY haranguing me about ""what I HAVE to do"" to improve my profile?  My profile is exactly how I need it to be...shut up and let me get on with it.  What I HAVE to do is delete this app.  For me the utility of 'Linked In' has always been a tenuous one, a bet based on future possibility, whose professional usefulness to me has yet to resolve.  This app update is the death of that possibility. The ball is in your court LINKED IN.  Fire some staff, apologize, and fix this astounding misstep. Give me a reason to not delete my account and succumb to the growing cultural zeitgeist that says that being professionally listed on LINKED IN is a JOKE.",1
2015-07-15 04:16:59,Why can't I edit my profile? Using iPad,"*edit: there is no functionality for mailbox features, only inbox. Users should be able to see their sent messages from the app. As I said in my original review, the app is beautiful, but the user interface is pointless without the availability of critical tools like full mailbox access, profile editing, and accessible search results.*

Positives: the interface is beautiful, easy to use, and innovative. The tab function was a fantastic idea, and whoever thought to implement it here deserves at least 6 figures a year. The search functions are powerful, despite being streamlined for mobile function. 

That being said....

Criticisms: the search function, this should render the results in a new tab. Having to reload and repeatedly scan a drop down is irritating. Drop downs are for quick selections, not searches.
And most importantly, I can't edit my profile, the single most important aspect of the service...perhaps I'm missing something, but there isn't a help feature either.

So overall, the service is great, the app would be great, but the inability to edit one's profile prevents me from offering more stars at this time.",1
2014-12-08 14:48:16,Necessary but only ok,"On the surface this application looks really fancy but the more you use it the more you notice the lack of attention to detail in the user interface. One of the most notable examples is using the email editor from an iPhone. The interface will not allow you to scroll back in a longer message if you need to edit and you cannot turn the phone to its side and get access to the larger iOS keyboard that has cursor key controls and other advanced editor functions.  If your only interest is to send a one or two sentence response to someone, then it's fine. If you want to send a thoughtful, longer email to a contact, you'll need to use the web interface.",3
2012-10-03 12:46:12,:),"It mayyyyy be the best thing that's ever happened to me. It should be the #1 trusted networking website, if it already isn't. The app is pretty good, you hust have to adjust your ""notifications"", but on your desktop computer, everything is fantastic.*** You must upgrade to get the best of the best! It's not THAT bad. And you can choose when you want to pay, so that's cool. Meaning- You don't HAVE to have the upgraded account forever, you choose when you want to pay for an upgraded account by month. It's awesome! I highly recommend it to job recruiters or job seekers. It helped me a ton. THANKS LinkedIn!!!! Xoxoxo",5
2010-10-15 08:38:32,Going mobile get's easier,"I've continued to increase my use of my iPhone to 'keep connected', and LinkedIn mobile app is just one more means of doing so. I recognize that this app doesn't reflect EVERYTHING on the full site, but it offers me a quick way to check the key elements I use. 
If I'm mobile and need to access something on the full site I can quickly access my Journey Web Browser on my phone and jump to LinkedIn from my bookmarked favorite.
So at least for me, this app does what I need it to do, and I consider it useful...not useless.",5
2017-08-19 14:48:08,LinkedIn is a journey to a better life,"What an amazing journey LinkedIn is. It's a pathway to reconnect with contacts and clients from the past, make far more new connections, and ultimately, to building the kind of business and professional network that never could have existed in the past.  In particular, LinkedIn has made it possible to connect with readers of my books. The thrill of hearing how something you wrote has changed someone's life is indescribable.  And that is what LinkedIn makes possible.  In fact, it's pretty much impossible to have a career without it today.",5
2013-10-28 05:18:33,Not intuitive or ergonomic.,"While this app looks good, it's capabilities are pretty shallow. I can't see members of a group I own/manage and I can't approve/decline those that apply to join. I have to go on my computer to do that. I also can not search for LinkedIn members who are not somewhere in my network so when I am out networking and meet someone whom I would like to connect with, I can't search for them unless they are 3rd degree or higher. If there is a way to change that then I haven't found it...which is another problem. The user had NO CONTROL of their app. No options, no versatility.  LinkedIn is a powerful resource for professionals. You would think they could come up with a better app so their members are empowered on their mobile devices as much as they are on their computers. The iPad app is no better!",1
2013-07-18 14:57:57,Request for improvements,"I like the app. It's much better and seems to offer more than the PC version. The complaints I have is about how it works with other parts of the system on an iPad.  Here's what I mean: I receive an alert in my email, from Linked In, that someone has a message for me, or has a change, or is requesting to become part of my network. I click on the link and a screen appears the asks me if I want to get the App.  I have the app already and there's no button to open it. If I press the ""Get the App"" button, it goes to the App Store and there's an Open choice there (after I enter my system passwrd). If I press the ""No"" button, the browser opens. Just not smooth at all.",3
2015-12-07 19:36:35,Terrible update!!!!,What was so broken with the old app that it needed to be fixed?  This new update is absolutely terrible.  LinkedIn -- you are not Facebook and I use each of you differently.  Integrating Connected is a waste.  With 2k + LinkedIn connections I am not close enough to the majority of my connections for Birthdays to matter but that doesn't stop you from serving up dozens of cards a day with Birthday notices and other useless info.  What I do care about as a premium member is who views my profile and with the new update it's impossible to tell how many profile views I have each day.  Not that it matters because since the update my profile views have all but stopped.  The old app was awesome -- now you have a bloated useless app that does everything but what it's supposed to do.  Please change it back!!!!,1
2015-12-03 21:23:41,You're killing me Holmes,It took me a hour of trying to adjust my settings to realize you had changed the mobile app for the worse. Why would you have removed access to my connections contact info that they have selected they are willing to share ? Before I could just click that info and drop them a note in a platform of my choosing not yours. Why would you not allow me to see my connections connections when they've permitted it in their settings ? This limits my ability to extend invites to other people to get connected with me thus limiting the expansion of linked in connections. Why would you force me to use another computing device other than my phone to make these transactions? Perhaps I'm missing something here but it seems like steps backward . Please repair,1
2017-01-19 05:56:24,Great way to stay connected with industry,"When time is short and sharing knowledge and experience can be at times a far distance away, being able to login and read and learn through the thoughts and experiences of people all over the world is critical to ones professional and personal growth. LinkedIn is a tool that every working citizen should have access to. The mobile app is great and easy to use. Helps you keep up with past and present colleagues. Read interesting and thought provoking posts and articles about your industry or industries you are curious about. Just a fantastic tool. Well done!",4
2013-05-23 03:14:24,Needs a severe overhaul,"This app is one of the worst I have ever come across.  You cannot update your profile, navigation is frustrating when you have to leap frog through 3 categories which are not exactly intuitive, and you're unable to do, well anything.  Alerts that someone has looked at your profile or any messages received never go away....ever.  Can't delete them either, they overstay their welcome, and like fish quickly begin to stink.  Oh and if you want to read an article, I hope you like cliff-hangers.  You can't open or expand the news stories, but you just wanted the gist of it anyway, right? The design is so limited that it really isn't worth wasting the memory on the app.  You're better off just using the website and dedicating the memory to that album you've been wanting.",1
2016-12-09 14:40:15,"Love it. ""Apply Now"" needs a little TLC","The app is wonderfully designed. Very intuitive interface. On the desktop, I use linkedin to apply to jobs. It is a single click process that sends your linkedin info as a resume.  I am a little disheartened that the mobile ios app functionality for this is so clunky. There is no one click apply. When you hit apply it opens a webview where the submit linkedin profile button opens a strange webpage. You can go back from this, but the apply with linkedin feature just doesn't work. Otherwise, love it.",5
2016-06-29 01:48:59,Seniority with Company,"I love the app. The only issue I have is that there should be a way to show seniority with a company even with position changes. I believe it's natural for anyone at a company that's been there for years to have several roles. LinkedIn doesn't show a person's ability to stay with a company if the person has more than one position. I should be able to select my company and years of tenure so it shows a true work anniversary, then there should be subgroups created for different positions while at the company. No company celebrates a work anniversary from the start of a new position at the same company, they celebrate from the time a person started working at a company.",3
2015-12-06 17:52:19,Horrible...,"Since the update I've really tried to give the changes a chance but I constantly find myself giving up instead. I am a young professional and an avid user of LinkedIn. I tend to use the app much more than the desktop version obviously for reasons of convenience. After the latest update there is information and data I simply cannot find anymore. As for much of the information that is still available I find myself constantly searching for it. Nothing seems to be logical with the new set up. So now, the app I once used for its ease and convenience has become a huge headache. Can you do us all a favor and PLEASE bring the old version of the app back?? On the prior version of the app no data was missing and everything was so easy to find in a LOGICAL location.",1
2013-09-06 01:28:55,Stay Linked and Informed,"I'm able to connect to others on a business level rather than personal. This helps me figure my circle of interest to affiliate myself with. That along with reading topics and articles of interest to business growth or strategies is very helpful. And being able to join industry specific groups is a major plus! 

The app is better than the desktop view because it helps isolate and compound the information rather than being spread out with other distractive tabs that could be open and grabbing your attention.",5
2017-03-22 22:52:01,What Happened ?,"This was once my favorite app hands down. However, ever since their acquisition by Microsoft it's been a nose dive for the app and company. Here is my experience: 

1. Customer service was one of the best and is now the worse. Snarky, rude, arrogant and extremely unhelpful. It's as if they hate their job and the company they work for.  

2.  Insane Cost. It was $9 /mo which was high but maybe something you would consider.  Now they literally want $100 per MONTH!!!!  More then my phone bill for likes and a half cooked app ...with the worst service I've seen. It's all sell sell sell. The death card for any company and very few things of value. 

3.  The product is just getting so bad and busy. Someone is so desperate to force engagement that they're shoveling ""everything"" they can into the soup. I would NEVER send a coffee sticker in a professional environment. 

In short, this app could be game changing for the business world and instead they are doing what every bad corporate entity does to a good thing. For those who started this, I'm so sorry to see what has happened. 

Hoping linked in gets back to where they once were and starts caring about people again.",1
2013-11-12 14:46:02,Pretty good,"In terms of look and internal navigation, this app is first class. My only little issue with the app is how it works with your email notifications. For example, I get notifications as an email for different articles my ""groups"" post or when people endorse me for things. When I click on the link in my email, instead of taking me to the article referenced in the email, it takes me to the ""home screen"" of the app where I then need to go and search for the article--which honestly, I rarely have the patience to do. I wish it would take me directly to the article. 

Other than that, I love this app!",4
2017-01-18 20:32:00,LinkedIn Projecting Forward,"When it comes to social media apps, LinkedIn comes in close second to Facebook for being easy, accessible, and interacting. LinkedIn however takes an interesting stance into portraying the quality of a connection in the form of being able to follow new innovations in recent articles, photos, and news development. 

This application should be one of the few you put on your home screen because of the true depth of exploring new potential opportunities and making the most of projecting your identity outwards.",5
2016-09-14 09:09:12,Great,"The idea of LinkedIn is great and the app is easy to use, very basic and not a lot of frills- which is good for those of us who use it daily and don't need to see a bunch of advertisements like on the web version. The only thing I've noticed the app does not offer is the ability to sort my news feed by most recent rather than what's trending. The website offers this filter and it would be great if the app did too, so I can see what's happening now, and not just the same stories every day. 
Otherwise great! 5/5 stars from this happy user :)",5
2016-04-11 03:02:29,I miss the previous UI.,"I can safely say that I've given this new UI a fair chance, and ultimately, it's terrible. I've been a usability and UX professional for 15+ years, so I like to think I know a thing or two about these things. This new UI is garbage. Luckily, the desktop version still allows me to use LinkedIn as most power users do.

First, for what use cases is this built for? Updates on network connections' birthday, work anniversaries, new connection, etc? No. That's Facebook. I don't want notifications event time someone from my 2,800 connections does something. The whole ""swipe through until you're all caught up"" shows a total lack of user understanding. Huge miss, I'm afraid to say. Yet, I'm still paying the same premium fee I have for the last several years.

On LinkedIn, I enjoy professional article shares, groups, etc. But the MOST important thing is to review who's posting what jobs, who's looking at my profile, etc. Much like the previous mobile app.

I don't mean for this to be any type of rant. I write this as an earnest plea to PLEASE fix this app. It's strange to see it still in the marketplace.",2
2010-01-28 03:51:04,Feel compelled,"After all of the bad reviews, including three written by yours truly, I am finally able to give a positive one. It really does seem like most of the bugs causing instability have been fixed in the latest release. I have done many actions including sending a contact request, accepting a contact request, replying to new InMail, pulling up my connections and viewing all connection updates (configurable in Settings) multiple times without a single crash. Any of those actions would have caused a crash prior to the update. So far, so good. Keeping my fingers crossed.",4
2011-08-16 20:07:10,OMG What an improvement!,"This dev team has made the Linked In app a useful tool once again.  I can now use this to do all the things I have wanted to do.  Check my groups add friends get suggested friends, the whole nine.  I have to say this has transformed Linked In for me it has made a more professional networking tool instead of a site I only care about when I'm looking for a job.  With this update I can see a real mechanism for building my professional social network while on the go.  This team did an outstanding job and it looks great.  It was well worth the wait.",5
2015-10-01 04:26:34,"Among other things, this is my complaint:","A big part of linkedin are the groups that you belong to. The main feature of these are the posts and threads that keep you informed about that space via links to other sites and blogs etc.

This is great, except that you can only view these pages inside of linkedin's sub-par in-app browser; providing no benefits of bookmarked, reading list, multi-device cloud-syncing etc. To my knowledge you can't even copy a link from the linkedin thread to paste in another browser manually. So when it's something I really want to see I google it by memorizing the title. I've come to avoid engaging with linkedin content fearing that I'll see something interesting, forcing me to re-live this frustrating UX.",2
2014-02-02 15:11:52,"Invaluable website, sub-par app","I practically live on LinkedIn. Having just completed a job search, I was on the LinkedIn website multiple times a day for the past few months. I love the website and am continually pleased with new functionality that's been introduced. 

However the mobile app is sub-par. While the latest upgrade is designed better and looks cleaner, the app is slow to load, difficult to navigate, and is missing a lot of the important features that the website has - including profile editing. Also I pay more for the premium version of LinkedIn so the app should recognize that and give me more features as well.",3
2017-08-20 19:03:21,Inspiration plays a role for sure and LinkedIn is the path!,"All that I look for in LinkedIn is for adding inspiration to self and others....

2016-04-27 18:42:29,Come a long way,"Certainly has come along way from the old days. I like the interface, however there needs to be a way to make it more difficult for people to post personal information that blurs the line between work and home. There are certainly a lot of features that are available on the main website that aren't available on the app, for example recommendations. Also there needs to be a way to simplify the mailbox to delete messages in bulk. I think a dedicated GUI for messaging is probably the future.",5
2015-08-06 03:13:21,The App can be better.,"I bought the app because I had the online version. The mobile App needs to know if you're a premium member or not. I'm a premium member and it keeps prompting me to upgrade when I don't need to. Also whenever I am invited to connect and accept new links I can't see the person once we connect, instead I have to look that person up to find them. 

There is a missing link between accepting people and seeing their profile once I accept. Also, within the app Email messaging can be improved or smoothed out. 

Endorsements are duplicated on a daily basis it seems like I'm endorsing the same people for the same things every single day.",3

Meaning this app is pretty much useless for me. 

There are many other issues that though they don't affect me as much, as incredibly annoying. It says ""15 people have viewed your profile in the last 3 days."" Click on it...shows the same 3 people that viewed it 2 months ago. News feed?! Yeah, thanks for the same one or two stories I've looked at for the last week.

If I go to the mobile version of the website, I instantly find what I need. The same goes for the search function, or should I say lack of a search function.

2012-06-08 15:06:29,No longer uploads your iPhone entire calendar to LinkedIn,"The last version of the app apparently took your calendar appointments and shared them (including meeting passwords or other confidential information you might have in the appointment).   

They say they fixed this problem in the new version, but they really lost my trust.  And i don't really know how something like this would be permitted by Apple.

Aside from the question over whether I trust LinkedIn to respect my privacy, my main critique is that the LinkedIn iPhone app is really *bloated* with too many features, it's cluttered and confusing, making it difficult to do easy things.  The website is the better bet if you want to remain a LinkedIn user after the recent news about what they were doing with your calendar.",1
2016-02-20 18:06:17,New design new challenges,"Nothing but frustration has come as a result of using linkedin app AND desktop since the redesign. Things that seem rudimental such as being able to see the message from an invitation to connect after connecting in order to respond, or clearly seeing your invitations period. The notifications don't correspond correctly and why can't I just like instead of commenting on my networks updates. NOW I'm on the desktop trying to comment on a forum and receiving error messages. The goal seems to be to make everything harder on the users. The app is so unpleasant to use now I'd rather have the old version back. Linkedin has such a monopoly and I've always been such a fan of its product this hurts me to write but come on, it shouldn't be this hard.",1
2014-02-15 17:25:41,Could Be Better,"I much prefer the access and convenience of having LinkedIn available on my phone.  I admittedly use it much more frequently than when it was solely a desktop experience. I've been having buggy issues with its mail capability however and mail seems to freeze and crash it. This past week I sent several vital messages via the app and they're not there now. To remedy this I went onto the desktop version, grabbed the contacts' emails and took the conversation out of LinkedIn. Not the best experience for me or my contacts and clearly outside of how LI would prefer we use their product & environment. You just bled business.",3
2013-07-25 01:31:31,Fantastic App for my iPhone!,"Hello team,

I am completely satisfied with what this mobile app does for me on my phone and on my iPad. Since I've been a member for quite a few years I can definitely appreciation the evolution of LinkedIn as well as the mobile app. The mobile app is ramping up quickly to almost have all same functionality as we have on our PC/Mac. I've also read some of the negative reviews for this app and I think it's definitely ill advised to pay attention to reviews that do not specifically site the issues or problems they have with the app so that the LinkedIn mobile team can address it. I clearly know the LinkedIn personal read our reviews and do everything within their power to make this app a more enjoyable experience! On that note great job team and I look forward to the future improvements. Btw Hello Mobile App team, I hope you find my review enjoyable :D

Cheers,
Michael Anderson",5
2012-05-21 21:23:42,Some bugs and rather limited,"This app is ok and unfortunately there are no alternatives, or i wouldve uninstalled it. Lots of improvements necessary. The major one would be the ability to open the app when u click LinkedIn link in ur email. When clicking the link, app that you already installed should open and log you in instead of pulling up the website and asking if I want to download the app. Also, when I click linkedin link in the email and choose ""dont download the app"" since i already have it, safari attempts to open linkedin page and although it looks like its loading,it never opens up. Also, there's no ability to delete connections from this app. Fix these ad I'll update my review.",2
2010-04-26 11:24:26,Good start but needs work,"Overall I like the look and feel if the UI and it is convenient to be able to access some of the features with it.  However the app needs full functionality. 

I an sure someone decided it should be a more lightweight version for mobile use but the whole point of having an iPhone is to have full functionality in a mobile form factor.

Also please fix the search which makes me want to pull my hair out with the glitches and hangups. It would be nice to be able to use it the first time instead if waiting a minute for garbage to finally appear before having to delete it and type in what you really want.",2
2013-10-19 03:56:11,"Good, not great","I like to have this as an app, but with the new design it lost functionality and fun for flashy.  Please revisit the purpose behind using this app.  I don't get on LinkedIn for a Facebook update which is what the new version feels like.  Make it professional and get back to the news articles being easy to access. It would also be extremely helpful if I could save or bookmark articles I liked.  Often times I've clicked on a link in an article and when I try to go back it just takes me to the most recent news feed.  This means often times I'm having to REALLY search for that article I was reading.  Hope an update is on its way....",3
2012-05-14 08:01:24,Limited functionality and strange behavior,"While this app might seem nice at first, you quickly realize that it lacks a lot of the functionality you'll find online. When searching for other LinkedIn members, I would like to be able to used the advanced search features. The Updates section is overbloated with information I could care less about; and when I do find something of interest, like updates my contacts have made to their own profiles, clicking on any of them just opens up a random stranger's profile! I don't get it! There's still plenty of potential with this app. Fix a few things here and there; then I'll revise my review. Until then, this is definitely a two star app.",2
2016-05-12 02:09:20,Great for networking!,"I really like this app. I enjoy following companies and fellow students at my university. I'll give this app 5 stars because it's free, allows for easy navigation of internships and job positions, and allows you to become informed about companies tailored to your profession. I will say that the app needs to be simplified a little. It's not difficult to use, by any means, but I find it odd that there are several different ways to view notifications and check on your connections. Regardless, it's a great app. I highly recommend getting it!",5
2014-05-06 18:53:11,Very same situation with Reviewer #5,"Same here. All social network of mine antagonizes with yours, which I have to restore again and again. Yes, I also encounter the deceased and even sex change(of course in cyber space) of individuals. It seems like someone or something literally generate new identities with modified SSN. I admit I may be able to hide or make a virtual cirkuit in the system. But I cannot generate or remove any individual against the nature of God and physics. Whoever you are, I am almost giving up with repairing the shell of a certain number of individual.

Don't give up. Thanks",5
2015-08-20 11:54:13,LinkedIn has an ethics problem...,"I'm not sure what exactly is going on here, but I suspect this app's notifications are programmed to get you to look at this app on a daily basis even if nothing new has happened. I regularly get notifications that I'm ""now connected to"" someone I've been connected to for years. 

Another deceptive practice is in the ""find new connections"" section. This includes contacts from your phone who don't even have LinkedIn and does everything possible to make it appear that these people are LinkedIn users and that you'd simply be ""adding them."" In fact, many do not use linkedin and by clicking the add Button you are spamming them with email ""requests to connect.""

2013-01-11 04:10:53,Linked in needs to be more Professional,"Do let me begin...
1.For the admin of a professional network app, this app leaves a lot to be desired. All updates seem to create more problems than fixes. 
2. This app seems to not work properly after ever update. It almost seen this app is never tested after fixes and enhancements are made. Hello testers, do u exist?
3. While LinkedIn is a great networking tool and resource, this app has so many issues, that one should use caution if he or she thinks about downloading and using this app. 
4. Completely fire the entire team that supports the app and start fresh. It is quite obvious the current team is not doing their jobs. In this day and age, we can get better with more ambition and enthusiasm to honestly create a functional, realistic, and useful app.",1
2017-02-16 16:21:14,This app manipulates you into connecting with others,"There is such a serious level of manipulation going on with this app. You get emails saying so and so wants to connect with you. You press accept. You get launched into the app. Once in there they don't take you to that persons page. Instead they send you to a page asking do you want to connect with any of these other people. I say no, but then I can't find any evidence that it did connect me with the person from the email. I can't even find this person in fact. I have to look up his name. Then I find I'm not connected with him so it didn't even do what it was supposed to in the email. Linkdins use of your email is deplorable for so many additional reasons but I don't have the emotional energy to go into it.",1
2013-06-18 09:30:35,Great,"First, I love this app. I like it far better than the iPad app -- if I have both, I always check it on my phone. The updates page on the iPad app is just unusable...

As for the iPhone app, there is only one reason why this gets four stars instead of five: when you get a notification that there's a new comment in a group discussion, clicking on it takes you to the relevant page but WITHOUT the newest comment. So the most recent one you can ever see is the second most recent one.  

Other than that, the app is great, and I hope the iPad app gets pulled in this direction instead of vice versa.",4

For several weeks LinkedIn has notified us that the LinkedIn App will basically be terminated around March 20-21, 2016 & that you can still stay in touch with your network by clicking on the my network tab on the LinkedIn App. Have found many anniversary, birthday & update notices on LinkedIn Connections App that are not on the LinkedIn App. This needs to be fixed to make the LinkedIn App better& more complete.",3
2015-09-01 03:25:29,Can't stand it....,"I've been using LinkedIn for a bit now, and love the website (in desktop form). Apparently, I am assuming as of recently it won't let me go to just the LinkedIn website anymore through Safari, so I was left no other option but to download this app. This app layout is terrible, it is difficult to search jobs on here because it doesn't let you search the same way the desktop version does. It needs to be more organized, the layout doesn't show nearly as many postings as the desktop, and the job relevance is WAYYY off because of the lack of search options. Please fix this, I really love the site but if through the app is the only way I can view and use the site I will have to delete it due to its lack of inefficiency.",1
2014-10-11 05:02:40,Impotent futility,"You've been unemployed for months now you're desperate, you're looking for a job, you're tired of resubmitting the same online job applications over and over only to not be responded to... luckily LinkedIn comes along and saves all of your data so that way you can submit your resume with the click of a button. Ideally this would be the case but it seems that every legitimate job that also accepts LinkedIn profiles requires you to supplement the data with nearly 70% Of the same redundant information you input in your profile in the first place. Not only that it seems that the LinkedIn profiles that are submitted to these jobs go completely ignored. If you are looking for a job please don't waste your time with this app it is totally useless.",1
2013-04-18 23:29:06,There is one thing that drives me NUTS...,"...and that's when I launch click on a link in my email to accept an invite or some other action and I am asked to sign in -- unless I have the app.  If I have the app I can open it. Why just not open it from the get go? There has to be a way for LinkedIn to recognize the fact I already have the app installed and just open it. 

Another thing is that once I perform an action on one device all my other devices should see it's been done. That way if I accept an invite on my iPhone I won't see the option to accept it again on my iPad, laptop or desktop.  

Beyond that...very nice app that I use a lot and enjoy using.",3
2017-07-26 17:37:48,Excessive Prompts,"For some reason, when I log on it frequently treats the session as the first time I am opening or seeing the app. It will take me through a series of prompts to add more connections or interests. I have looked for a way to turn this off in settings and don't see it. Why do I have to go through 5-7 different screens just to open the app? I get that this is a ""first world problem,"" but it makes me not want to use the app at all. 

One other thing: I do not like the algorithm method of viewing a feed. I would rather see things in chronological order. At least Facebook lets me choose that option. I do not see that we have that capability in this app. Another reason I don't want to use it.",2
2017-07-13 16:11:18,Amazing app for business professionals,To me what LinkedIn has done with their platform is groundbreaking. Now with this app you can stay up to date in your professional network right at the tips of your fingers. I use it constantly. I am a working sales professional and it helps me stay up to date with all of the current news in my industry. I have even managed to connect with people who were once acquaintances and are now in my network. I prefer it much more over any platform. Keep it up LinkedIn!,5
2016-09-21 02:24:20,Does everything I need,"Although each and every app can be improved and I have a hard time giving ANYTHING 5 out of 5 stars, I   Will give LinkedIn 5 out of 5. It does everything I need including things I didn't think I needed.

Update on Feb 13th:

I hate intrusive apps that invade your privacy and do things without your authorization. This app and their new update just sent out 12 invitation requests to people I don't know or people whom I don't know well enough to connect. Very sad and very unprofessional LinkedIn. Only until someone accepted my invitation request did I realize what the app did. Got rid of this app as that was the last straw.",5
2015-12-05 01:21:37,New version is a step backwards,"The LinkedIn mobile apps have always suffered from lack of feature parity with the web experience and the previous iPad app has always lagged behind the iPhone version in capability and usability. 
About the only thing this update seems to have done was make the iPad and iPhone versions about the same in capability and feature set. And it hasn't marched further toward the web experience in the process. 
Couple of key misses...stats and comparisons to my connections and LinkedIn members in my company. I used to check that frequently. Another one...contact information. It's a lot harder to get to now. 
In my opinion, the mobile experience needs to mimic the web experience more closely. 
This update was a real disappointment.",1
2014-05-25 16:39:18,LinkedIn iPad app is unusable,"I've been very disappointed in the LinkedIn iOS app. Having used LinkedIn since 2006 I depend on it to manage my professional network. I am a paid subscriber. The app designers seem to have lost sight of why people use LinkedIn. Getting pushed random content is occasionally interesting but mostly just gets in the way. The core functionality, for example,of inviting someone to join your network with a personalized message has been lost. It just fires off a canned message to the person you are reaching out to, and damages your brand in the process. I have learned to never try to connect with someone new with the LinkedIn app because it makes me look bad. Use the web version til they remember why people use the service.",1
2013-09-04 17:03:36,A Couple of Small Improvements,"When sifting through ""People You May Know"" - once you select a profile, no matter how far down you scrolled, when returning back - you're always back at the top of the list against. It would be great if when selecting ""back"" in the iPad app that it would remember your place where you've scrolled to instead of resetting you to the top of the list.

Two. When choosing to invite someone to connect, an automated invitation is sent without any way to personalize the invitation with a note.

As I use the iPad as a tool at work as much as I do a laptop, it would be fantastic to continue improving upon this critical app.",3
2013-08-19 17:04:12,Updating profile via app,"When trying to save your IM under contact information, it will immediately vanish after returning to the view your profile page.  Please fix this bug, thanks!  

Also, I recommend that you add a filter option that allows Linkendin app users to find jobs that can be applied to via their phone or pad.  By doing this, it will help ease the troubles of those who only have their phone or pad with them.    

In addition, for companies looking to hire, it is recommended that they post jobs that can be applied to directly on LinkedIn instead of redirecting us to their company website and into their system.",3
2013-08-19 16:12:52,Terrible app!,"I use LinkedIn a lot On the desktop, but it's a shame they released this poorly conceived design for Apple. Many flaws and surprisingly confusing user interface and navigation. Just two examples: in group forum discussions there is no sort by date option so you've got an odd interleaving of old and new posts. Sometimes I can't even find a way to see older posts. Also, today I tried to accept an invitation but suddenly that option disappeared. I then tried to salvage the situation and send an invitation to the person who had invited me. But her profile showed her to be already connected to me as 1st. Then I went back to my connections and she was not there.  Searching on her showed her not to be connected. Huh? Often waaay sloooow too. Come on LI: fix this app!",1
2017-06-09 05:24:59,Please change the way photos are listed when accessing smartphone's photo library!,"The LinkedIn app is great - but despite repeated and detailed criticisms about how photos are arranged when accessing one's smartphone's photo library when posting a photo, nothing has changed.

It's mind boggling that LinkedIn chooses to have photos (at least on my iPhone 7 Plus iOS 10.3.2) listed BASED ON THE EMBEDDED ORIGINAL DATE OF CREATION of each photo, EVEN IF THAT PHOTO HAS BEEN MODIFIED - which makes it a headache, if not impossible sometimes (if it's several years old), to find original photos that have been modified and re-added to the photo library specifically to prepare a LinkedIn post - rather than BASED ON THE DATE IT WAS ADDED TO THE PHOTO LIBRARY, which by far most other social media apps are set to by default, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, LINE, etc., for a good reason.

Please consider this comment and review this issue, and change this obvious flaw!

Thank you,

I really like the new calendar tool which helps me to quickly see the background of the people who I'm meeting with on the spot. I was skeptical of the influencers feature just added but wound up reading several bios and articles as a result. 

My only ask is that when I receive email updates from LinkedIn and I click in the link, I would like to be taken to the ap and not my Internet browser which doesn't work as well with LinkedIn on the iPad.",5
2016-06-04 11:01:33,Continues To Be An Invaluable Networking Asset,"I see some complaints regarding this latest version of the LinkedIn mobile app for iOS. Totally disagree and as a longtime user of LinkedIn trust me when I say disagree. 

LinkedIn continues to provide me viable, substantive connections - and indeed I've had multiple large successful deals the trace their inception to this mobile app. The latest user interface, once you use it for a few weeks, is clearly superior and a positive evolution of the app - too many give the latest, substantial evolutionary upgrades about 12 hours before firing off a super negative review of the app. I've taken my time and can, the LinkedIn mobile application for iOS is my finest business app - by a large margin. 

I cannot recommend it highly enough. 

My only issue with LinkedIn itself is finding the time to interface with LinkedIn more...and this app helps solve that.",5
2015-12-03 20:31:50,Still looking for a few features,"While I'm sure that any major refresh of an apps UI will be met with critical reviews, a brief learning curve is to be expected.  What should be focused on by reviewers is (in my opinion) features first, functionality closely second, and aesthetics next.

I am still waiting for the mobile app to provide all of the profile editing features of he web-based interface of linked in.  Ex: reordering skills, reorganizing profile, editing recommendations, etc.  The new features are ""cute"" but not as fundamental as what is still missing.

The functionality and flow of the app has been good all along, and is equally good with the new version.

The refresh looks nice, but less branded then before (read: more generic).  The profile view looks amazing, though.  The rest is almost too clean in that the eye is not directed around and there is less familiar structure.

I think some tweaks would make this a 4-5 star product.  Not bad so far, LinkedIn.  Let's see what else you can do.",3

I also don't like that in the job search it automatically defaults to the app even when I'm trying to use the web browser. I'm not sure if that an app problem or not.

Most of all, job searching from a mobile phone is awful. There are not enough filters, no obvious ways to search for part time, virtual, or telecommute openings. 

Finally, I have no clue why its so hard to copy a link, a picture,or anything! Makes it hard to share with colleagues outside of linked in. Somehow this feels intentional...",2

Completely stupid ideas like removing the group pages and adding it to another app, never makes the program better. Using this app was suppose to be easier then using this program on a desktop computer, just as a mobile phone is suppose to be easier then a computer. Unfortunately this app makes it so impossibly difficult to use that it is easier to use a computer, no matter how out of the way that computer would be.",1

The first place I go to when hiring or wanting to get a clearer picture of a prospective customer. My best advice! If you are going to be on there don't go on halfway, learn how to use it and fill in as much relevant info as you can.

I have gotten nothing out of it - nothing. It is like Facebook, but they keep you trapped and it just seems like some sort of work-stalkers haven. I get creeped on by a bunch of gross middle aged dudes, and I'm a man. That's not cool. Linked in is a publicly traded company. Why? How do they benefit the ""public good""? It is shameless yet oh-so-shameful Wall Street greed, along with the rest of Silicon Valley. Startup, a series of funding, and the rich get richer by forcing these companies to go public. Wall Street banks, the investors, and the board of directors profit - not you. Oh, sorry, but I digest; the app is bloated - just like Reed Hoffman.",2

If I have been ignoring a suggestion for someone to add to my network for the past year, shouldn't the app notice and suggest someone else?

You do realize that this is the way of the future don't you? Soon this will be the primary access point to the network not a complimentary app... If it doesn't get considerably better I can envisage people leaving in their droves as it will only take one company to produce a similar tool that works on mobile and I, along with many others, will turn as quick as you like....",1

The ""homepage"" of the interface comes off as lazy or you just didn't know what to do with all the space, this is from a designers standpoint. I would also like to have the ability to like someone's comment in a group. It would help of the app played along a thin line between the website and an application, a lot of similar functions and more simplified but strategically laid out interface.",1
2013-05-31 00:33:37,How Do I Like LinkedIn?,"Return the older LinkedIn version- this new one stinks! Also, I would like feedback on questions and concerns. Twice I have initiated communication requesting help on two issues, and have yet to hear back. For example...

I am not thrilled with some of the language posted; I once commented on a user asking the word f_ _ _.   Come on now, this is not FaceBook. 

The articles are great and relevant to my background and profession. I do participate in discussions. LinkedIn used to have a delete & edit feature that  was very useful for spelling errors and such, but now it is more difficult to use. 

Other than that, I have connected with great professionals in my field, and reconnected with former managers and co-workers with whom I lost contact. 

Thank you LinkedIn, I enjoy the interaction. Simply return the older version, it is more dynamic than its current one, and I believe you will have more satisfied customers that will USE phone application.

Then, when I close it, there is still this massive yellow ad-like bar at the bottom of the screen that still says ""find new connections."" I understand, linkedIn is about connecting professionally, but this is so excessive, and so obnoxious that it makes me not want to open the app ever. In all different parts of the app, I am being aggressively coerced into finding new connections, and it is extremely uncomfortable.

I know, Lean, Agile MVPs that teach the company about customer demand are the strategy of the intelligent entrepreneur.

2013-05-22 15:01:20,Shallow,"For all the nagging that linkedIn does promoting this app, I assumed it offered more.  This app gives you very shallow, limited access to features that are easy to access on the web.  

For example, reading messages:  for some reason I can only read the most recent thread in messages?  How hard is it to show me all the threads, like mail clients do?

Put some effort into it LinkedIn, or at the very least STOP plastering those splash screens insisting I use the app every time I navigate to your site.  This makes me want to drop LinkedIn.",5
2012-10-08 04:32:48,No updating or editing?,"This app doesn't allow you to update or edit your profile. It's basic at best, and is honestly not worth downloading until the creators make some drastic improvements. 
I have one bone to pick with the website too...it gives you the option to upload your résumé, but instead of posting your résumé, the site ""extracts"" information from it and appears to merge that information with what you have already entered into your profile. Once you edit everything and save it, then go back to your profile page, NOTHING has been updated. 
Proposed solution: Have the ability to upload your résumé to your profile without extraction or merging. Just keep it the way it is! Provide a link to a PDF version or something.",1
2012-05-23 20:06:07,lacks flexibility to customize messages for connection invitations,"The app does not allow a user to customize the message being sent when requesting a connection. The default message is not very professional, and since this is used by professionals to connect with other professionals that seems absurd.  Another suggestion for the Web site:  it should also allow us to create several customized invitation messages, say 5 per account/profile, to be used in different situations and allow for further customization in each invitation.  This would make it a truly flexible and robust tool for professional communications.",3
2011-09-17 16:45:39,SO disappointed - Add favorites  & new connection section back in,"In the previous version, I used this app several times a day. Now that most of the functionality I used before is gone I completely ignore this app and it's such a shame. 

I had set up a great list of favorites (you could mark certain connections as favorites) and then by clicking one button you could view your ""favorites"" list and see only their shares through out the day. Perfect system for reading job shares (posts) from recruiters. I have 1000+ connections and now I have to read one long feed of shares from all connections. I give up after a screen or two. 

Also there was a section that listed new connections. It was great to view all new connections and there you could chose to mark them as a favorite or not before they blended into all your other connections.

If not adding favorites back to this app, can you at least add this functionality to the website? 

Everything great and useful about this app was trashed in this update. Now you have to jump around to 4 different sections that do nothing but let you read info.",1
2017-06-30 18:15:33,Great Tool,"LinkedIn is more than a job search. I hear negative connotations associated with LinkedIn all the time. ""It's good for recruiters and job searchers"" and that type of thing. However, LinkedIn is a great tool for reaching out to influencers in your industry, connecting and networking with people who share the same professional questions and concerns as you. I highly suggest that everyone create a LinkedIn profile. It is perfect for finding a job or simply connecting and learning from others in your field of work.",5
2017-03-31 13:46:11,"Almost never opened this app, but now …","I'm on it just about every day. Their latest iteration is a vast improvement over their earlier ones. Now, LinkedIn is looking a lot more like everyone's other favorite Social Media timesuck, Facebook. But I, for one, don't consider that a bad thing. I don't spend too much time of Facebook, anyway—mostly checking in to wish my friends happy birthdays and doing a quick read of the first page or so of postings. Now I can duplicate that quick check-in by using LinkedIn.",5
2017-01-22 15:07:07,Many issues with latest update,"As others have mentioned this version has many issues that greatly affect its usefulness. It does not update for days on end (currently mine hasn't updated for 5 days). It also assumes I don't have a profile set up and keeps encouraging me to complete one. Lastly the search function doesn't work at all- returning a 'no profile found' message. Quite surprising for an app as established and widely used as LinkedIn.
I do like the Facebook like quality allowing you to stay in touch with your field and quickly acquire relevant information for job hunting or development but unfortunately some folks are not too professional with their posts and I haven't discovered the way to edit my feeds just yet.",1
2015-12-13 16:33:41,LinkedIn feels threatened by Facebook,"In 2016, Facebook will roll out ""Facebook at Work"" to compete directly with LinkedIn.

Feeling threatened, LinkedIn rushed to update its user interface, in a desperate, fear-driven attempt to copy some features from trendy social media apps. LinkedIn's management is scared that users will drift to other social media. 

The latest result: a half-baked mess. The new user interface is confusing, ill conceived, and steeped in pop culture. In other words, at odds with what we all assumed was the core reason for LinkedIn's existence -- namely, an app/site for grown-up professionals.

The iPad version of the LinkedIn app displays only in Portrait mode, which obviously renders LinkedIn un-ergonomic if the iPad is paired with a keyboard accessory. Imagine having to rotate your head 90 degrees to the left, in order to read the screen while you're typing. A great way to develop neck strain.

Probably less widely known, LinkedIn is allowing itself to become a harbor for softcore porn posts, in the name of ""freedom of speech"". In other words, in a desperate attempt to compete for eyeballs.

Let's hope LinkedIn stops trying to be trendy, and grows up.",1
2015-07-24 01:13:21,Pulling My Hair Out Over Profile Editor,"I'm going to first start off by stating the positive quality that made this app review two stars instead of just one: It is very easy to input any information and see what is missing from your profile.

Great! It does its sole purpose, but only to a certain extent. Now here's the negative: The photo uploader makes it extremely difficult to crop photos. (Or even change them for that matter!) The photo cropping editor that automatically forces you to shrink down your photo is not actually cropping where the guidelines are.

Also, there should be an easier way to navigate back to the home screen without straining my thumb on the back button. I think I'm starting to build a callus.

As well as, having an option to ""opt out"" of the profile set-up tutorial. Every time I go into the app it has me add people I might know. I keep getting bombarded with the same people from my contact list that don't have an account they fully set-up yet (a.k.a. blank accounts). I am starting to assume this is a glitch.",2
2012-04-28 17:17:23,Finally....,"At long last, an app from LinkedIn that uses the iPad real estate effectively. Excellent and engaging interface.  There is a learning curve (hence some of the critical complaints.)  However, once I understood the layout, very easy to use.

As a heavy LinkedIn user, would like to see next enhancement bring in the advanced search capabilities available in the online browser version -- would make it even better.

Install froze up with no data like many of the comments.  Had to delete the old version and then reinstall the new version.  Worked great from then on.",4
2013-04-05 20:58:22,"Very poorly built; the app that ""makes you an over you can't refuse""","When I am reading on my iPhone or iPad and click on a LinkedIn link, instead of going to the mobile version of the site, I am taken to an intermediate page where I can choose to download this app, or say no thanks. In every single other company that does this, if you click no thanks, it just continues to the mobile version of the site. Not LinkedIn, no. The page flickers but remains on screen.  You literally cannot get past it if you do not want to download the app. This has occurred three or four times, different links, different days.  I resent being held hostage to download anyone's app. That's not good business. Good going, LinkedIn; now I simply don't click on your links at all.",1
2012-05-01 02:17:25,Not well thought-out,"Some things you can only do using the web interface. So you go to the web and the first thing that happens is you get a screen saying that you can download the app which of course you already have but which doesn't  work for what you are trying to do. Or you want to respond to an email from LinkedIn. The link will not cause the app to open, instead you ate sent to a the same browser screen telling you about the app that you already have. So even if you can do what you want to do with the the app, you have to close the browser and try to navigate to what you need in the all. The whole point of the app is for convenience and time saving, and this app is not very convenient and does not save time.",1
2017-07-19 01:34:24,"Professional, and easy to use","I certainly have adds crop up on occasion, though these are easy to dismiss.  As a social media, this is my preferred connection experience, as content is very relevant to my current interest in developing my career.  I'm really picky who I follow, though find a lot of great articles to draw inspiration from.  More often than not, I feel positive and refreshed from the good content.  Always eager to recommend to others, as this is an awesome tool to reach out, build connections, and help people out.",5
2016-09-22 16:09:17,Great & Efficient app,"This app is definitely helpful in the need to connect on the go. Anytime I need to see what's going on career wise I am able find out the latest news. Not any cons I know of. App updates right away when you update on the website from your laptop.

Job search now is a whole different story. First it doesn't find what I'm looking for when I search. Second it doesn't match me with the right hind I believe to actually fit me. Third none of the jobs I see pay well. When I do apply to some jobs to see what's it's about I really don't receive an response. I'm not sure I understand the whole thing.",3
2016-06-25 17:01:37,Great way to stay in touch,"I have been a Linkedin user for many years. I find it very useful to stay in touch with colleagues and share interesting articles or my own posts.  It is always a work in process to improve your profile.  For those of you disappointed in the job search feature, work on your value statement in your profile and the jobs will come to you.  Companies and recruiters are using LinkedIn, if you don't have a polished profile, you will be overlooked.",5
2016-01-20 23:23:58,Very Handy App,"I've recently found myself using the App more often than I do online at my PC, which shows me how useful and convenient it is.  One minor shortcoming is that I can't go back and check a list of those who've not responded to my Invitations to connect. Otherwise it has nearly everything the online version does.

Update:  I dropped one star from my review for the recent update. I find it much harder to find things that used to be easy to locate, especially my Contacts.  I also very much dislike that the Contacts are now alphabetized by FIRST name whereas the online/Web version is the more logical LAST name.",3
2015-12-07 22:00:57,"Update took away landscape, bring it back","please remember that people leverage your app on iPhone and iPads... on both platforms it is extremely useful to leverage landscape mode... I can't believe you took that away...larger phones and iPad Pro specifically lend themselves to landscape... please bring back ASAP.

also, you took away the ability to send to an external email address... it makes it basically useless...   I used to use it as a sales tool and HR tool to find and make connections... and then it would translate to actual business value when I could send an email to the connection's work email address.. instead of continuing to tie up their LinkedIn personal email address if that's what they had linked... please bring it back... ASAP...",1
2015-09-25 18:23:22,NOT Mobile Business Friendly....,"I'm using this app less and less.  There is very little management functionality that you can perform within the app.  If you are a Group Manager, there is no way that you manage your group within the app.  I contacted LinkedIn Support and I got the usual, ""we will submit it for consideration"".Users have been asking for this functionality since 2013 so apparently it is not critical at the LinkedIn think tank. Complete mobile functionality is critical for any business related app.  Unfortuntely this app, and LinkedIn, is become less relevant for business networking.  Marketing people apparently like it, employers on the other hand have told me that they get very little from LinkedIn other than intrusive emails.",1
2015-03-30 02:12:39,"Not impressed by LinkedIn's efforts to increase engagement, time on site","I would've thought LinkedIn's creators would have judged their members to be overall a smart bunch and not much impressed by all their algorythmic stuff - people's work anniversaries (since it depends on members updating profiles, half are wrong), the appeal to narcissism (who's viewing your profile? - I don't quite believe that so many of the same people have viewed my profile multiple times in such short periods), the rate-someone's-strength stuff, etc

Also, on their content play,they may have garnered some big names but I rarely have read such bland useless stuff",3
2014-05-23 04:06:26,Decent app. Horrible spam email invites.,"If you allow Linkedin to have access to your contacts or address book it will send out email spam invitations to every one. Not only that but it will send out two more ""reminder"" invitations. You have to go into your 'sent' email box and individually withdraw each invitation if you don't want the continuos spam. The withdraw process will take a minimum 1hr depending on how many contacts you have and it can be very embarrassing and damaging professionally. I had invite requests sent out to my management and it just wasn't a good look. If they address this problem then the app isn't too bad. Good for connecting professionally with people in similar industries.",2
2013-01-06 16:14:30,Can't believe how bad this is,"It's amazing that this app, focused on the business community, is so so poorly written.  The app crashes, freezes, gets out of synch and at best, is painfully slow.  I have deleted this app in disgust and frustration multiple times but because I am a paid online LinkedIn subscriber, I keep coming back and reinstalling the app hoping the issues are finally resolved.  How is it possible that the company has been so slow to recognize and inept at resolving the programming flaws of this app?? This reflects not just on the app but on the LinkedIn management team, which clearly does not have a handle on customer feedback, project and performance management.  With the world's business community as your customer, such repeated, chronic failure is unconscionable.",1
2010-01-28 21:27:21,Crashes & Annoyanaces,"UPDATE: With the new version, the persistant badge and repeated crash issues both appear to have been fixed, so Bravo! Features-wise, this app is a HUGE improvement over V. 2. I'd like to see Groups, Jobs, and Twitter updates make their way into the app, but this has definitely come a long way. 

I love LinkedIn, and I think, features-wise, iPhone app 3.0 is moving in the right direction. That being said, I have never encountered a more unstable app. It crashes when I attempt to do almost anything. I have only been able to get my list of ""connections"" to successfully load once. 

Seriously, it's not that hard. Look at Facebook; they get social media on the iPhone right!

Also, please fix my biggest frustration: the persistent ""new connections"" badge on the app icon. I know they're there, i've been notified, now give me a way to clear the freaking badge!!!",4
2011-08-16 17:20:18,Aug 16 update!,"I downloaded this app about a year ago and was not impressed by the feature it provide. I actually did not even use it! A few months later I quickly uninstalled it, after reading a new update to this App was published that changed everything about this App I rush over to the app store and downloaded the app. 

The updates to this have really made this application stand out from the competition, I actually want to use this app now! I Highly recommend it do yourself a favor and press install.",5
2017-08-19 11:44:10,Connecting with Industry colleagues,"I love this app! I have connected with professionals all over the world but especially my region. It has helped me build relationships with clients, teaming partners and potential talent. I love article app where I can write about things I'm involved with and excited about. I also really like how the app helps me stay connected with my network through endorsements, Birthday wishes and employment status. I have had online conversations with top industry leaders, cutting edge thinkers and people in the trenches who are working on implementing some of our coolest developments. I fly with this app!!!!",4
2016-04-29 03:09:03,Great app but....,"I've built several thousand contacts in my industry and frankly, less than a hundred are relevant. Make sure you put a professional photo if yourself and take the time to build a complete profile. In the beginning you're tempted to accept every invite for numbers sake. If they sell a product you don't want, reject the invite. Block your contacts so people don't raid your list and bombard your friends with spam. The premium option is pricey. Take the free trial and determine for yourself if it's worth it. I use LinkedIn daily, it's an important part of my toolkit.",4
2017-06-16 14:40:49,LinkedIn is the best Professional Networking App,"Definitely deleted FB and using LinkedIn now to get inspirational messages from business leaders and friends. I love using this app to showcase my skills and learn to become a professional within my career. Very relevant and factual articles. I can get lots of insight from here without the cute distracting animal videos I get on FB. They are essentially different apps, but I find that LinkedIn helps more when you are trying to build a professional rapport vs. personal page on FB.",5
2016-01-29 10:44:20,Professional Application,Professional app. ~ It has enabled me to connect with other professionals that I would not have had the opportunity to meet. There is a vast array of knowledge being shared that has enhanced my success. I have received many grant writing requests over the years. The application also can assist professionals looking for employment. I am very pleased with their customer service...very helpful. Truly a remarkable device. I recommend that you partake in the LinkedIn experience! You will not be disappointed.,5
2015-04-21 14:58:21,"Horrible performance, missing key features","For all the usefulness of LinkedIn as a service, the app — and the entire LinkedIn mobile experience — is a complete and frustrating failure. Really important features like seeing sent mail or other folders, are missing. And the app's performance and reliability are atrocious. My phone runs like a tiny pocket furnace when I'm on LinkedIn for more than 3 minutes, which might be seen as a feature during the cold winter months. Simple network requests can completely freeze the UI until the app is force-quit. Really, the best LinkedIn feature in mobile is the ability to toggle ""Desktop View"" to get any actual use.",2

That's very valuable for many fields..As a LinkedIn member since 2004. The current release is truly unusable. Swiping, re-org'ed UI - but no real product improvements. Lipstick on a pig. This is a classic case of responding to style trends, and forgetting that great products solve problems, remove barriers to opportunity. I used LinkedIn App daily, and now find it completely useless! PLEASE FIX IMMEDIATELY! even a rollback is better than waiting.. Next time, maybe a public beta??",1
2015-02-20 12:51:09,Great business connector but needs work,"LinkedIn is good but frustrating as well. I paid for premium service due to the ""Numerous"" anonymous"" views on my profile and linked in decision (at that time) not to show you every view. Premium service did not show me any more information than the basic service. Very disappointed. 
The last update improved my biggest complaint thank you ... Trying to open links or emails on discussions, it use  to make you to new app, install or sign in required, then the article is never found. Great improvement.",4

2015-05-12 01:39:56,Great for networking but weak in some areas,"As a tool for networking it has been stellar.  The mobile application is quirky with fair integration.  Could use some improvements on posting and application stability.  

The use as a tool for career search and development is less than optimal - even with advanced search capabilities.  

The premium service leaves much to be desired as visibility of who is looking at your profile and the metrics associated with how effective changes might be are totally missing.  You are paying to have an icon of indeterminable value on your profile.",4

However, the app is sorely lacking in functionality. The navigation is not at all intuitive and the search function barely works on the app. As a resource used frequently for networking at conferences and events, you would think that they would put a lot of effort into making the mobile app excellent, but if I can't even successfully search for the person I just met without pulling out my laptop or the desktop site on my phone? Where's the usefulness in that?",3
2013-10-21 18:41:32,Easy to use and great for connecting,"As I'm currently looking for work, LinkedIn has been incredibly helpful in doing research and connecting with people. I do wish they could be more flexible with the section titles, but I have otherwise had a grey experience. Many of the volunteer and professional organizations with whom I work are switching from Facebook pages to LinkedIn just for the added degree of professionalism. The app allows access to all of the features of the website that I use and is visually appealing.",5
2016-06-22 12:17:11,Lack of functionality compared to website,"Not really sure what this is good for. Complete lack of functionality compared to the website. I get notifications that are like ghosts - I open the app after I get a notification that ""Fred Bloggs is now a connection"" - and all I get is the home screen. No in-app notification, no view of ""Fred Bloggs'"" profile - nothing. I can't even view my new connections in the app. And it shows me events from months ago. 

Not really sure what they are paying people for over at LinkedIn, but it's obviously not to build a user-friendly, useful app. The most annoying part is how we're forced to use it as the desktop version isn't easily accessible from mobile devices. 

Disappointing.",1

Google+ looks pretty, but I've yet to find a use for it. LinkedIn, on the other hand, provides fascinating news stories you might have missed elsewhere - and the ability to connect with people who actually have something to say.

I used LinkedIn - primarily through the app - at least as much as, and now probably more than, Facebook. It is an essential part of my day, and a great way to keep in contact quickly and efficiently. 

I also greatly like the standalone LinkedIn Contacts app for iPhone - extremely useful.",5

However, you cannot view your previously sent messages or any of your archived messages. Job search function is basically unusable. There is no way to filter results by location, for example. You get results in no apparent order from all over the country. These limitations are unnecessary and I can't even see that they have anything to do with whether or not you upgrade to paid versions.

Can't read messages that are in my inbox. All that I can do is see my profile, updates, others that are direct connections and provide status updates. These are the very basic features of LinkedIn, and I would expect that at least some of the easier advanced features would be available (is it difficult to allow access to my inbox?). A lot will have to be put into an update before I regularly use this version.",2

Original review: I cannot paste from my phones clipboard into password fields. This is extremely annoying. I use a password manager— an app called Dashlane, it's amazing and I highly recommend it— but LinkedIn is the only app I've found which does not allow me to paste into password fields. My passwords are extremely long and complex for security reasons and this bug makes entering my password EXTREMELY difficult. So difficult I will simply not do what I'm trying to do until I can get my laptop and do it there. If this problem is not resolved soon, I will make it my mission to annoy Reid Hoffman and all of his employees until they do fix this. I will be relentless.",1
2014-09-11 23:30:19,Connections Plus!,"With the advanced communications now at your finger tips (literally), getting connected via hyper texting is now a reality. In the olden days 'Networking' required tools. Today, 'Networking' is still the norm but requires new tools. That's where computer and smart phones take the stage. While all that's true, computers & smart phones are helpless in getting you connected without a versatile program as ""LinkedIn."" Offering you the best way to connect is what ""LinkedIn"" does. If you are currently using it, you know what I mean. If you're not, try it! It works for you!",4
2016-05-09 02:15:06,Loving LinkedIn,"To me this is the best social app invented. LinkedIn does just that. Links you to professionals in any field, open opportunities not seen anywhere else, keeping up to date with your connections and making new ones. I recommend this app to everyone young and old. Sometimes I can't believe college students are not using it to make connections. I recently visited San Francisco and found a LinkedIn office building and was super excited and took a picture 😊 I love the app so it must be very cool to work for the company.",5
2016-01-20 18:56:57,New App Update concept is great but not working well at all!!,"I like what LinkedIn is trying to do with its latest drastic update by attempting to making it more user friendly but it was a drastic change in which users don't know where to find things as easily (such as, how to endorse without going to someone's profile). The idea of the instant messenger is great but it is the greatest problem of all! A lot of messages are delayed, or does not alert that they have you have one or in general very slow to respond. Hopefully these will be fixed in the very near future since many are considering (if not already) deactivating their accounts due to their frustration.",2
2015-04-14 11:28:34,Just okay,"Needs better editing capabilities available on web, such as contact, job application submit, and group settings editing. 

It would be nice to store a resume version or more so when you apply you can simple attach whichever version you want. Ditto cover letters. 

Also, if you ""Like"" or comment on a status update, you will receive notifications related to that update, until you delete your comment or ""Unlike"" it - even if you disable notifications. If there are too many comments and you can't find yours, you're doomed to receive updates from everyone else until Hell Freezes Over, or Linkedin fixes this.",2

However, it takes some input and contributions from its users in order for it to work for you.

2017-08-13 00:57:22,Why so randomness,"I have been Linkedin user for a long time and love this company. There's one thing I dislike about Linkedin and that's your feed.
Whenver I refresh feed on desktop or mobile, it randomizes the content. Sometime if I go to view any profile and come back to feed, it's already been refreshed. This feature frustrates me as a user and I would request you to change it as per facebook's feed, where the content is retained even if you go to another page by mistake.
I hope company reads this review and implements it. Thanks 🙏🏻",4
2013-11-14 11:16:51,Not worthy App Policies,"How is it possible you've  developed an app to allow people getting in touch with other people you don't know ""business and network wise"" but to do so your app requests subs to input the email of the contact you wanna add to, isn't awkward and contrary to all logic?, if I want to get in touch with someone I don't know, how am I supposed to have that person's email without knowing him/her?
Besides a ""your account has been restricted"" alert keeps popping up into screen with not apparent reason... when contacted you to review this I received none feedback, zero, ""nada""... 
You must definitely work towards better up both, customer care and customer satisfaction levels, because having this app it's just simply not worthy.",1
2013-07-03 21:20:40,Wish list,"I think the app is pretty good overall. I do wish they'd change a few things. I'd like to be able to filter my updates feed/change who I see updates from. Also, being able to see my groups and manage them from the app would be good.
The most important thing, though, would be to open the app when clicking links in email notifications. Sometimes it asks if I'd line to get the app, but I already have it. Many other services will open the app directly from my gmail app, but LinkedIn mobile site doesn't seem to recognize that I already have the app installed.",3
2015-12-12 17:28:46,Unable to download since new release,Let me start by saying I love LinkedIn. Unfortunately their iPad app is terrible. Even before the new release I thought the app was not well thought out for a typical user. A typical user like me wants to search for jobs but on the iPad app this functionality was very limited and frustrating. Since the release I am unable to download the app at all and it has nothing to do with space as I have a 64GB. I am surprised that a company like LinkedIn would produce an app of this caliber. Their desktop experience is really the only way to use this site. This really limits usability and opens the door for another site to sneak in. I will say their job app for iPhone is great. I wish they would release that for iPad.,1

Addition of LinkedIn Contacts even improve my rating and satisfaction level. Very much recommended app if You like to stay in touch with HH, Your pro network!",5
2014-03-13 18:00:04,Mines your personal data,"I am a paid user of LInkedIn but had to delete this app.  This app mines your address book and address data from your phone without authorization and maintains it on their database (which you cannot see) even after removing the addresses individually on their website. Check out the many complaints on this subject on their community web page.  I was getting prompts to connect with people ""That I May Know"" that could be found only on my phone, and some of them happened to be deceased! I did not want to subject my business networking to unauthorized data containing personal acquaintance information, so I reluctantly had to delete this app given that there was no way to stop this intrusion.",1
2013-08-26 13:42:26,App misses critical functionality,"A primary function I want for the app is to open group notifications I receive via email. Whether using the app or mobile browser, you only ever get the LinkedIn home page - never the group post you want.  Finding the group post via the app is near impossible.  I'm not interested in Facebook-style functionality for my professional network on the phone - I don't care about random new connections among colleagues or ridiculous new skills others report to have.  LinkedIn is leaving a huge gap here for a competitor to step in offering quality mobile functionality for professional networks - hope someone steps in.",2
2017-09-15 15:54:08,Excellent App. A Must-Have For Your Phone!,"I have been a member of LinkedIn and using the app for years now. It is a must-have for your business productivity arsenal allowing for wide exposure of yourself and your work skill sets. This app makes it incredibly easy to search for and connect with like-minded friends, associates, and business leaders to expand your connection portfolio. The app is very easy to navigate, locate connections, send correspondence, etc. I highly recommend this app. You too will agree.",5
2015-07-09 15:45:41,"Pointless Feature ""anonymous""","I have been a recruiter and in sales.  The whole point of social networking is to network.  The ""anonymous"" viewing of my profile doesn't do me any good but make me feel as if I'm being watched by a weirdo with no good intentions. 
We should have a choice to allow anonymous to view our profile.  Just like we have a choice to not accept anonymous phone calls. This is the right thing to do and we should have this option to allow or not allow anonymous users viewable access to our profiles.",4
2017-04-21 15:20:08,Great professional connections,I only started to use LinkedIn 8 months ago when I started my own business. I use Facebook for fun photos to keep up with family around the world. But when I started to focus on building up a strong professional network I turned to LinkedIn. It has been amazing. I keep up with all the latest research and read comments and perspectives relevant to my field. It has boosted my business and my self confidence at the same time,5
2016-10-27 13:47:23,Bad for messaging,"You're typing a long message to a colleague to congratulate or say hi how are you, but you need to click out for a moment to take a call or check another app. When you come back, the message is lost, now you have to type again.
Also, its still an annoying service that sends you ""this person wants to connect"" messages just to make you click to their app. Get it together people! 
By the way, please remove the automatic ""this person wants to connect"" field and make a personal message a priority, very impersonal.
Now you are owned by Microsoft, don't make your users fell like its just gonna go downhill from there like it always does.",2
2015-12-04 07:12:29,App shows different info than desktop: New App is terrible!,"This App is terrible! I made changes to my profile and it didn't change on the App. Considering this is an important tool for my job search, and I'm a premium member, you would think they would have an outstanding App. Most people (read recruiters) are mobile and conduct searches on their tablets and phones: my profile doesn't match the desktop site! Also, when you connect with someone you can't write them a note to introduce yourself. I work off my I Pad and dread using this App. UPDATE: Now, as of December, the new App is worse. I can't believe they could make it worse, but they did. Good lord..and to think we pay a premium for this junk.",1
2015-11-09 03:24:36,Connected with people I did not want to connect with,"So I just downloaded this on my new phone and the first thing this app does when I opened it and signed in was send a ton of invited to everyone on my contact list.  I was simply clicking the ""everyone"" link in an attempt to DE-select all those people then it automatically sent and invite to ALL of them.   No confirmation or anything!   Stupid! I'm tempted to delete my whole LinkedIn account over this, there are people that I unfortunately need to have in my contact list but would NEVER want to connect with them in any type of social network. No app for has ever operated like this regarding contact lists. Screw this app I will delete it once I know this review goes through.",1
2015-07-07 21:48:55,Annoying New Pop-up,"Whenever I start the app, I get a full-screen Pop-up prompting me to ""add connections"". The only obvious button is ""continue"", what grants permission for LinkedIn to invade my privacy by taking all of the Contacts data on my iPhone.

This is super-annoying, why does this prompt come up even after I have dismissed it in the past? I can't believe there's no way to turn this off. Ugh!

Previously the app worked fine and once I get this pop-up out of the way the app seems to work well. But it's always a bitter feeling when I open the app because I have to deal with the pop-up!",3
2014-01-14 03:11:23,Great App Looking for a Small Fix,"Its a great downsized version of the online program. It is simple, clear and delivers the basics well. If it were much more featured it would be harder to use and on a phone that is a big negative. The fix that us needed is a better connection to search engines. If you find someone listed through, say, a google search, it often requires you to sign back into the App when it is already open, and then frequently deletes the search so you have to type the search back in.  There must be a fix.",4
2015-05-07 04:10:32,I'm so confused...,"I'm confused about the purpose of this app. You would think it would function like the website would where you can edit your profile and establish your connections with ease. Instead, my updates fail after loading for a very long time. Maybe the purpose of this app is to frustrate the user into going to the full site to generate more online traffic?

In short, this app has a clumsy UI, and its profile management is severely lacking. I gave it two stars because you can at least receive updates to your connections' profiles.

My feedback for the developer: overhaul this app to function just like your website! Thanks!",2
2014-11-19 07:59:04,Great for professionals and future professions,"As a student at a university trying to make my way in the real world this app and social network is extremely helpful. 
I can connect with people to be able to find a job and create a larger network. I can figure out what interests me and read articles that are extremely informative about a future career. 

There is so much more I could say about this app and social network. Download the app and create your LinkedIn profile now! You won't regret it!",5
2014-07-12 08:21:52,emails and app don't connect,LinkedIn mobility frustrates me because I receive all my notifications via email on my phone but when I click on the email link it takes me to the mobile web version with an option to view the app instead of going there automatically. Then when you choose the view app option it goes to the home page instead of to the link you wanted to see from the email. There needs to be much better integration. Now also I cannot complete a download of my contacts. There are some big basic bugs that need to get fixed.,3
2014-07-08 15:05:54,"Still a few small sticking points, but good overall.","Great networking app. Unfortunately, when you edit any of your profile information for a position you hold/held, it announces to the world that you received a new job. This may hurt you in job prospects who can see your profile. The other option is to turn off notifications entirely. This also is not perfect. Having a checkbox to designate  ""this a new position"" would be helpful. That way, if the box is not check, the notification does not go out for a simple edit.",4
2013-07-21 16:31:23,I'm about to go postal!,"This was my favorite networking app EVER! I am a social media marketing exec. I insisted and aided all my clients in establishing accts. encouraged upgrades to premium acct etc. 
Over the last 2 months the app completely freezes when I try to share an article. I have followed all the ""help"" advice. Submitted a work ticket with a copy of all crash reports etc. ( no response)
Went to Verizon to make certain my phone had adequate memory Andy cache was clear. ( just another set of eyes) was given a green light for my device. 
This only happens during LinkedIn. I am a premium acct holder. The crash totally disables the phone that I must force a quit and hard stop and start. 
Please!!!! Address the issue. I can see from forums I am one of many!",1
2013-04-07 01:50:35,IPad App worthless,"Like others I much rather just use the Safari version of this app. Many of the features of linked in either don't work or aren't available for the iPad app. The problem is every time you try to advance on the Safari App you get an annoying pop up box saying get the App. It doesn't ever recognize I have the stupid thing, but don't want to use it because it doesn't offer the function I came to complete.

If you clicked no thanks and that was it, it wouldn't be annoying. But you have to click no at a minimum twice, every time you try to move off the page you are on. If this keeps up then I will just forget LinkedIn. If I wanted to get annoyed I would start a conversation with the wife... J/K",1
2015-12-06 02:16:20,"Change, can you handle it?","I like it. Perhaps the layout and functionality is more right brain now... I like how it shows my post reach front and center. The layout seems to be more geared towards connecting and relationships versus 'data' like who has viewed me and number of connections. It puts the content of others more front and center. 

On a side note, I think the rating of this new version is a great representation of how the workplace handles change. You people can't handle it! 😉",5
2015-12-02 05:48:25,Yay! App overhaul looking good,"Thank you for finally overhauling the app! Looking good so far.

Old review:
Conceptually, I really like LinkedIn. I think it's a great tool for keeping track of all the people you've met at work and school. However, both this app and the website are full of a ridiculous amount of bugs.  Come on LinkedIn - you've had almost a decade to get your act together.  You have a huge user base, name recognition- what gives?? Please hire some decent programmers to fix up your platform!",5
2015-10-29 23:53:36,Annoying introductory screens,"Every time the app updates, which seems pretty frequent, I am presented with the same introductory screens basically prompting to scan the contents of my phone to find any trace of an email address in which to offer connection suggestions. These screens take about 5 clicks of the skip button in order to get past to access the app. First of all, I don't particularly like the idea of scanning my contacts and email accounts for connections. Secondly, why would I want to do this every time you push an App Update. 

I have since deleted the app. The idea of a professional social network was appealing, but I have since come to realize how poorly implemented it is and can do without it",1
2015-04-26 22:17:46,A great way to network,"I wish Linked was around when I first started working. Most of those more senior contacts that I knew are not on LinkedIn. A few are and I have reconnected with many, as well as current contacts. It is a great tool for retaining contacts and your network. The groups, the job listings, the flexibility to put as much or as little about your current position makes it very easy to customize your profile to suit your privacy and networking concerns.",5
2015-02-15 23:36:13,For such a big name and purpose...,"This app is terrible. There is barely any consistency with the web version vs. mobile web version and this. You would think you can update things in one place then rely on the app to allow you to do the same. Not here. I mean really, not being able to delete updates you added online? I rarely write reviews for products but I'm a product manager who understands the need for consistency, especially for a product of such importance that reaches so many people. Not a good app at all. I only gave it two stars because it allows me to send messages and brows pretty fast. Other than that it's pretty bad. Consistency - lacking.",2
2015-01-12 09:45:37,Minimal feature base for LinkedIn,"It's ok. Ok. 
Still not updated for bigger screens - I'm not sure why not. I'd imagine they have tons of resources after they went public to invest in dev teams to put out at least a scaled app. No need to reinvent the wheel here. 

I'm a light user of LinkedIn. I have premium, I check it like once a day to connect or see what my network is up to - and that's it. (Actually I should probably cancel my subscription after now just realizing...) For this level of activity, the app is adequate. For recruiters and other power users, I'm not sure if it'd suffice. But it's free to use, so hey - just get it and give it a go.",3
2014-08-01 07:10:47,Still no profile editing for iPad,"Astounding that a company that can claim mobile expertise still has a completely outdated app for iPad this many years after releasing its first mobile app. STILL no ability to update ones profile from the iPad app. What's the point of even doing a native app, if all it does is allows for basic reading and browsing. The share capabilities are sub par and less than the mobile version, the profile editing is non existent, and the performance is still a memory hog and crashes the app, if you go too deep in the browsing. I guess linkedin is hoping people get tired of waiting for a good native app, and just go back to using a browser, so that they can finally give up and admit defeat.",1
2014-07-21 15:54:37,What happened to my LinkedIn ...ahhhh!,"LinkedIn is a vital part of my business. I've kept my network fresh and valuable for over a decade by excel. Then in 2003 Reid Hoffman convinced me he had a new vision and now 10 years later its better and a key instrument in my bag if tools. i get all the insight and important info at my finger tips. The only thing missing is my group editing ability. Add that and it's perfect. 

Only thing missing is the ability to manage my alumni group and ability to scan biz cards.",5
2017-03-21 18:04:53,Overall Pretty Good App,"I hardly have to use the desktop site.  I took off one star because of the incredibly annoying banners that pop up at the top of the screen to inform you that your invitation to a prospective connection is on its way.  They take forever to go away, and if I've shot off a handful of invitations it takes several minutes to be able to access the search bar at the top. Please correct this LinkedIn, I use that search bar frequently for different reasons.

Other than that, I love this app!",4

If one's first time accessing LI is through this app, they would certainly Not see any value in joining, let alone paying for a premium account or advertising.  This is where you make your money, so why lose customers by showcasing an extremely limited piece of eye candy? ...if you even want to call it that.  Hmmm.  Very disappointing from the leader in professional social media!  Take it down and get back to the drawing board.",1
2015-08-20 17:52:34,Great App!!,"I like LinkedIn as it is another way to connect to people professionally. It helps to have an alternative method of interaction though I still value face to face communications as well. LinkedIn helps because commuting is so challenging in our area. Sometimes when you have a quick question or need to briefly catch up, it is better to use LinkedIn and not interrupt professional associations with a phone call. LinkedIn also can easily keep you abreast of industry interests and discussions!",5
2016-03-18 17:18:37,Notifications are a hot mess,"The new format is confusing, but the biggest shortcoming is the notification ""function"". I have badges pop up with and without anything new appearing in the app and they often remain after I read the item that generated the notification. This has caused me to ignore the badges entirely...which would be fine except that LinkedIn's  email notifications are intermittent and lag far behind when an item shows up in the app...
Overall, this behavior causes me to miss messages, search for new content that doesn't exist and get confused as to which notes are really awaiting my response. Net result is that communication stalls, hiccups and fails.",2
2016-03-03 10:59:19,Not intuitive and easy to use,"LinkedIn design is definitely lacking. Simple things like notifications and network updates are difficult to find and act upon now. Same goes for reading linked articles (a majority). LinkedIn keeps making it difficult to copy posts or links to share them on other channels like Twitter. In fact I now like using the web version much more even though it's not much better when it comes to complexity.

LinkedIn is making a mess out of a simple 'read feed and respond' app. I consider myself a pretty savvy and Mobile first user, and have given the new design several weeks to get used to, but I'm still struggling to navigate. Something is truly off.",1
2014-02-12 14:29:35,Good almost great,"This current version is certainly an upgrade from the old. It is easy to navigate and all the bugs seem to be worked out so it's very user friendly. My only knock on it is that it does not include all the functions of the website. You cannot see, for example, interests or the ability to edit skills at the same level of flexibility as you can on the computer. These are minor details that wouldn't matter to most and even with these issues this app is among the all around best I have ever used.",4
2014-02-14 05:47:02,Not too bad,"The app does some of what it should, but in fields where there is a character limit (ie in a forum response) you may experience errors which give you no information about why 'the message could not be sent'. That's what character counters are for.  I don't particularly care for its navigation arrangement, but  I've become used to it in a tolerant sort of way. The thing to keep in mind is, LI is probably not terribly worried about the app. They know folks will tolerate enough to stay with the service. Plus LI makes use of mining their boatloads of data on the professional sphere (part of the reason it was founded).",3

I have found out with this app I am able to make better ties in the work community! Linking in with those even in other states whom may have the same idea as I, who might need some help in an area, myself needing advice or maybe one day one of my children needing a piece of advice and because of a connection I made..... that one person being able to give them the advice I may not be able to! I see others being able to work in one city for someone in another state!
This is absolutely a brilliant idea for those who take their work seriously. For those searching out what they may want in their life........this would help them as well!!!

As soon as I switched to my gmail account my ""People You May Know"" is flooded with every person I have ever sent a personal email to and even some I have not. I have never allowed LI to sync with my email. I have triple checked all settings and permissions. After researching and seeing other people with the issue it appears the app is the source of the problem. The apps built in permissions allow it to data mine your phone for contacts.

I wish I could use LinkedIn mobile app for reading business and economics news, but I have to turn to facebook instead because the experience is more enjoyable, although it also makes me see stuff that people post.

2015-10-03 03:18:56,Why are the connections so difficult??,I get 10-15 emails everyday about asking me to connect. It would be so much more user friendly if I could sign onto the website or App and connect with all of them at once or at least on one page. It takes too long to respond to each individual email. This may already be a function and I just can't figure it out?! But if that is the case it brings me to another point of the website and app not being very user friendly.

And why aren't the developers listening (or being told to listen) if this is the biggest complaint (given feedback below?) Hard to believe that this is an insurmountable coding issue. I'd be on LinkedIn more if it was more streamlined in this respect. Thanks.",3
2014-04-30 13:58:41,Latest update for iOS is bogus,"There is no camera feature allowing the user to add photos to status updates. 
I've been going back and forth with their support group and they seem to not know what they're doing.
At one point I was told, ""Thanks for contacting us. At this time we don't have this functionality available. However, I've sent your suggestion on to our product team for consideration. When many of our members ask for the same improvement, they try their best to get it done. However, due to the number of suggestions they receive, they usually don't provide a timeline.""

Great app.
One more thing which could do it even better: when trying to connect people from the app, add a simple text box ""notes"" under the ""+ connect"" sign  - so I can write a quick note - for instance where and when I met this person ...",5

2013-08-05 18:56:08,Useless and annoying,"I don't know why Linkedin has been so poor for last few years in developing interfaces with the mobile and tablet technologies. This iPad version, for example, is useless and huge,y annoying. To begin with, even after I read the messages on iPad, they still appear as unread when I open the site on laptop. There's no integration with the email; if I click on a LinkedIn request received on my email, it directs me to the PC site and doesn't direct to the app.
Recently, I'm not able to accept friend requests, send any msgs and do practically anything with the app. I'm uninstalling it today and thought I'll warn y ou before that.",2
2013-06-12 21:21:57,Not too bad,"The app is not that bad and it is clean in design. However, it is not as comprehensive as the website. For instance, it would've nice to be able to update my skills by searching for them and not just using common or related ones. It would also be nice if my email links for LinkedIn actually took me to the app rather than open a page in Safari.  It would also be nice if I could see everything that my online profile has. What's the point of having the information there if its not visible on the app, which many people use to stay up to date.",3
2012-05-06 01:54:20,Idea is good implementation needs work,"I can see you are trying to use the iPad real estate  more effectively, but implementation needs more work
1)  key information of interest wrt to co-LinkedIn members is lost in the confusion of ""all updates"".  
2) I find myself more annoyed than excited when I  move through the update window, so currently I go to my iPhone to get my updates since this interface is to the point, less is more.
3) When I update my profile the iPad version does not update my profile unless I log out first while the iPhone version which does not require this.  
4) Update of who has viewed my profile is not current compared to what I see on my iPhone. 
5) Ability  to quickly skip through my contact list based on last name would be very useful, something similar to iPhone version (alphabet on the side). 

Please continue to work to evolve the iPad app into something that in addition to looking good is truly designed  to convey information more effectively.",2

Also - The stupid push notifications are the WORST. It rings once like a phantom with nothing showing, and then rings again another minute later with what you were supposed to see the first time. Absolutely aggravating. 

If it wasn't for LinkedIn, I wouldn't have my current job. For that I'm grateful, but the functioning of the app needs a lot of work.",3

Version 9 takes away previous functionality like the ability to see your connection's contacts, which is the primary way to network and meet new people through existing connections. However, added is the ability to remove a connection.  Therefore you can take away connections but not build your network.  Seems like they are moving in the wrong direction to me.  Seriously looking at Spiceworks (IT industry) or Doximity (Healthcare) as new platforms to network since LinkedIn doesn't survey its members for advice and makes bad AppDev decisions like removing key functionality.",2
2015-12-26 19:44:34,What a miss step,"Sat down to load some of the apps I use most often on my new Christmas gift, iPad Mini using the new Logitech keyboard (which is wonderful I might add).  When I got to LinkedIn, I had to tilt my head to the left at a 90 degree angle because apparently they forgot that adaptive UI design includes both portrait and landscape orientations.  It got worse from there, the intuitive navigation has been replaced with a few buttons, which definitely looks cleaner, but makes finding anything you are used to navigating to a real big chore.  As a professional marketing person, I would suggest two words - test groups.  I certainly won't be using LinkedIn on my iPad.  Hope they fix these issues soon.",1
2012-07-21 12:39:49,links need to launch app when we already have it,"LinkedIn itself needs to figure out how to get its links to recognize apps we already have.  I have a LinkedIn account that I use frequently via browser, and I have the LinkedIn app, too, but it's ridiculous (and frustrating) that every time I'm on my iPad and click a LinkedIn link, it takes me to a promo page to ""get the LinkedIn app"" instead of recognizing that it's already installed and just following the link.  The net effect is that I can never follow LinkedIn notification links in email (browser or app-based, Gmail and Yahoo) or feature links on webpages on my mobile device.",2

I was really pleased with the UI on this app; however, I was disappointed when I found out I couldn't even edit the simplest information on my profile. I think Apps should be more than just sidekicks to a their websites. They should look to be an alternative way to access most, if not all of a websites information and functionality, and this unfortunately does not do that.",4

Its very simple to use, especially when editing your profile, making connections and corresponding through the messaging system. Most importantly, LinkedIn is great at recommending different connections and attracting recruiters to those that are open to opportunities.

2016-08-30 16:49:18,Lame service and grabage app,"I've been using LinedIn for many years but some time ago cancelled my subscription as the service provided became useless and significantly overpriced. The same with the application for iPhone.

I don’t see any useful updates of my supposedly “professional” network and instead I see only myriad of advertisements and news clips. And I really don’t need another news application or alternative to FaceBook. It looks like as a professional network LinkedIn is dead.

The app size is humongous – only the app alone consumes 167Mb! I have some games with a lot of bitmap graphics in them and they take significantly less space. Can’t even imagine what a junk spaghetti-code is used in LinkedIn app.",1
2016-03-04 17:23:56,Couldn't find list of my own connections,"I hate trashing things, and have never written a review before. But, LinkedIn was somewhat useful for me as basically a white pages professional directory.  Now it is barely useful as each time I have to figure out all over again how to find my own contacts. Turns out they are buried a few clicks away in a spot that is not at all intuitive. Why not have a direct link to them?  Aren't the connections themselves the main freaking point of this whole exercise?  Your app has gone from something I used sometimes to something I almost never touch because it is so frustrating.",2
2015-09-26 04:09:24,Poorly designed,"This app was almost impossible to navigate. When I logged in, it presented me with the option to add people even though I had already done that on computer and when I tried to skip it it instead sent invitations to everyone and I could not find a way to cancel them. I went to the help page on their website and it didn't match either the app or website and now I've just connected with everyone I didn't want to with my limited number of invitations (that limited number being 3000). After Facebook I would think a networking app would be easy design in at least a way that wasn't completely terrible but clearly that is not the case.",1
2014-05-20 03:01:45,Invasion of privacy,"I used to like LinkedIn – but that was before they decided to expand their reach. I now get at least two or three LinkedIn acceptances a week from so-called ""invites"" that I sent out – none of which is true! LinkedIn basically invades your mail server to find new addresses to invite to you. If you've ever given LinkedIn permission in the past to access your contacts, you are screwed forever. There is no way of stopping this from happening now – except for a class action lawsuit that has been filed against LinkedIn. It can be embarrassing, or downright harmful to business, when LinkedIn decides to invite anyone in your contact list – especially if they are the opposing party in a lawsuit. Beware!!",1

The app is very good and not glitchy, in over two years of use I have never had people bothering me or spamming me like I have had on three other major media platforms. Very good for professionals, job seekers, even retirees and the disabled to connect with others who don't wish to just post silly jokes and smoochie selfies but actually find work, reconnect with previous co-workers and get reviewed for work done.",5

I am in apollo beach Florida, but the system lists me as in Tampa bay, if I put in a search for a companies local office and they have 12 offices around tampa bay without opening each listing, and looking for clues it's impossible.
You may link with a friend that works around the country, so you look through his friends only to find people who are hundreds or even thousands of miles away.

2015-10-04 14:03:19,LinkedIn app not working well on iOS,"1. when typing a message and accidentally closing keyboard, the text disappears. I always have to sign in on laptop and write messages, reply to emails through web browser.
2. the app freezes for 2 minutes after startup. It could be caused by latest version or after upgrade to iOS 9. The app is trying to load scroll view, I think.
3. LinkedIn never leads to getting hired. I'm member for 4 years and despite being connected to 40 - 50 recruiters and in network of 5 millions or so, I was hired only when applying on job listing website. I had perhaps 100 to 200 direct contacts, but nothing leads to actual job. This network gets highly overrated.",1

The interface of this app is great and blends well with iOS 8/9, but you cannot edit your profile through the app... I end up having to go onto safari and use LinkedIn via the web because the app cannot address all of my needs. If this isn't fixed I am just going to delete the app and use the web, which is great, but if you're going to make an app, make it useful for things other than just checking the status of your profile.",3

For example, there's no way to see messages you've sent. The app is also sluggish to update at times and you need to refresh multiple times to get the most up to date information. 

Other times I'll get notifications from this app that make me think someone has requested me or sent me a message but it's really just a LinkedIn notification telling me they found people I may know. That's unnecessary and frankly obnoxious.",3

When I started using this for finding people that were a fit my network started growing and I realized how useful this app is for meeting qualified people. I'm really hoping that the capabilities from my desktop would transfer to the mobile device. Like some other reviews I have read, it has been consistently improving and I hope that continues.",3
2015-05-23 19:54:58,"Come on, add more features","The time has come for Linkedin to stop making us go to a computer to change any little thing. It is such a major pain. The apps let you do nothing but add a post or accept a connection. 
I personally can't stand linkedin, it is so pointless and unwieldy in so many ways, but I guess were stuck with the dinosaur in the room.
At least get with the 21st century and add more features in the app, such as hiding excessive posters in the newsfeed, being able to disconnect from a spammer.
Really the founders of linkedin should be counting their blessings daily that they got as far as they did with such a monumentally clumsy interface.",2
2012-11-01 18:35:05,Snarled my entire contacts list,"LinkedIn is quite possibly one of the most useful online social networking resources available for professionals - well designed, highly functional and a great value.  I have been a paid subscriber for years & highly recommend it often.  Based on that great experience, I downloaded the LinkedIn app for my iPhone.  Unfortunately - this LinkedIn app has made a complete hairball of my contacts.  Couldn't imagine a virus or a hacker could have done any worse.  Some examples… 

1. None of the linkedIn user photo's are with the right contacts - for example, male photo's are showing on female contacts
2. Many contacts now have other peoples emails and phone numbers in them

Most disappointing, I have reached out to LinkedIn customer service for help via their customer service contacts offered on their site and there has been zero response.  So at this point downloading this app has made my contacts near useless - very big problems that prior to downloading the LinkedIn app I did not have.  Proceed with caution.",1

There's no 'I already have the app'-option. This needs to be integrated. Also, why do I have to log in so much? My phone is password-protected. Having to type the password in every time is too much friction. I also hate that there's no password reminder within the app. The in-app functionality is annoyingly limited. Also, LinkedIn itself may need to disambiugate universities. Today I received a news bit about Washington U, the private school in St. Louis. I actually attended the U of Washington -- the land-grant institution with Seattle main campus. Pretty bad.",1
2012-02-27 22:53:28,"Great app, needs a few more tweaks","Overall, this is a great app and provides what many are looking for in terms of mobile LinkedIn functionality. However, as an avid user, I would love the ability to edit my profile (job descriptions, summary, etc) through my phone as well.

The app is easy to navigate. 

The only thing, though it's big to me, is I really wish you could update/post from your business page on the app. It is very frustrating having to always log on to my computer to post a daily article or post.",3

Thank goodness I still have the old version saved on my desktop computer. I was able to revert to the older version on my iPad. If you are reading this, do not succumb to the temptation to hit the update button. Leave it alone. The lesson learned here for me, is that I have turned off automatic updates for the App Store. This will never happen again.

When every time you open the app it tries to get you to send invites to everyone in your address book (not just those that already have linked in), asks you to rate the app just about every time you launch, and routinely makes you click through 4-5 pages to avoid becoming one of their little marketing spam bots I am really peeved. So I finally clicked yes to that annoying rate me display.

I get it, you want to be facebook, and you want to leverage all your users to recruit new users. But, no one wants to be that annoying friend that invites all their contacts to install and play Farmville.

Taken a step further, the app would like you to shell out for a subscription to access ""premium content"" give me a break. 

The app has mild utility (and I stress mild) as a networking app, that over leverages its users and is, by far, one of the most annoying apps I have ever installed (and that's to say nothing of the constant emails). Bah.",2

Try it, find your coworker and companies. Find a group, which shares their knowledge and sign up with these.
Private commends and photos are not welcome.
Share your knowledge and experience if there is a discussion going on, you like to join.

Well, LinkedIn takes this to a whole new level.  Not only do they obfuscate every URL and disable the ability to copy the URL to paste into a browser, when you click on the URL it takes you to LinkedIn's crappy built-in browser and the only sharing option is to share with your linkedIn connections.  God forbid I would want to bookmark and email myself this link.",2

It crashes on a daily basis. I have not experienced this with any other app. More frustrating, however, is having to use the full site on a daily basis, as the app (and often, even the mobile site) lacks a number of functions - recommendations, customizing a connection request message, modifying group settings, etc etc... Hopefully we'll see some improvements soon, as LinkedIn really is a great tool and the app has potential.",2

The ability to use LinkedIn Groups to create a platform for professionals to network and share job opportunities is a feature lacking which is ridiculous for a business networking platform!

Biggest miss by far is issues with messages...the app badge, the notification on ""Messaging"" itself in the app menu bar, and an email alert all tell me I have messages to view, yet when I actually click on ""Messaging"" in the app to read them, it always says ""No messages--yet!"" Say what? The only way to view messages is now by browser. The app is good for a news feed only at this point. To actually engage with anyone on LinkedIn, you might as well get on your laptop.",1

Seriously, for an iPad app it's subpar at this point in the app's life cycle that it does not have almost full desktop type features. I gave 2 stars just for the ease of use and decent (although the layout could be better). The app is almost pointless except that it's easier to read profiles and news on the iPad rather than iPhone.

Plagued with crashes and links to nowhere, this application is a far cry from what we would expect a business user to use. With unprofessional layouts and nonintuitive menus that require you to dive deep into the bowels of the application to check messages. Compared to the fluidity of the website this app is nothing short of a disappointment packaged with a ""can't get any worse"" interface.

2013-04-19 02:43:51,Great Resource,"I love using this app, it's so convenient on the go, being able to keep up with all of my information and job opportunities.  The biggest thing I would change is the ability to add and rearrange skills and expertise in not only the app, but the mobile site as well.  Another minor detail I'd change would be on the mobile site, when you select the full site view that it actually stays full site and doesn't go back to mobile the second you select an option.",4
2014-01-03 01:07:38,Ok but room for improvement,"Overall the app interface is much more seamless than the website, but you can't access all of the features presently available on the web. The full profile doesn't appear for people you are searching.  Also, I find it irritating than every time you click someone's post it then takes you to the web version and you have to log in again. But the good news is the photos are larger and easier to see on the iPad than on the web.  Keep tweaking it and hopefully it will improve!",3
2013-11-13 04:01:08,Great app for professionals on the go!,"Love this app! Works great on iPhone. It's great for quick checks and adding connections. This app, much like most social media apps has a very scaled down version of account settings (for security reasons) which I can accept, but can be a little frustrating because I still need to do a lot of major changes using a laptop or desktop browser. Besides this I think the developers did a fine job with the app interface.",5
2017-03-10 20:20:17,Easy to use,"I like the Linked In App for building my professional network. It's an easy way to connect with customers and colleagues across the world. I've been able to find and connect with potential customers so it has really been a useful tool. 

I'm not fond of the feed so much as I find it a bit cluttered with basically advertisements which overwhelm the posts that are about actual business that my friends and colleagues are posting. I wish there was a way to filter that out.",4
2012-11-30 04:54:32,Deleting this app,"The iPad app seems to do everything you don't want it to do. When I click messages, it takes me to the profile of the last person who messaged me. When I click to see who has a new job, it takes me to the profile of the first person who changed a role. The articles don't load. Not sure what's going on but would love to see these quirks fixed. My usage drastically reduced once Twitter removed the hashtag integration and w/the tablet app being barely functional it feels pointless to continue using LI. Stop trying to be Facebook, focus on what you do best - connecting professionals to their network.",2
2012-07-17 10:47:19,"Not glitchy, just inadequate","I haven't experienced any of the glitches mentioned by other reviewers, but I do feel that the app's design fails in some significant ways.  There is no way to show or access groups you belong to from the main page.  If a group doesn't have a recent discussion, you can't get to it.  There is no way to search for anything other than a person.  Want to look for a job posting?  Out of luck.  Want to find a thread about a specific subject?  Out of luck.  Want to locate a group and see who the members are?  Out of luck.  As it stands, it's a good tool for adding people to your network and not much else.",2
2016-10-12 12:46:45,I dig this app,"I've used this app quite a bit, as part of my military transition. It has been a big help and had a positive impact on my job search. I sincerely appreciate the fact that they give retiring military folks like me a one year Pro level membership for free. That is putting your money where your mouth is, and it means a lot to me. Love this app. One complaint is the messaging portion of the app. It's only a small part of the whole process, but it is still sticky, slow and finicky. Feels like talking to someone via email.",4
2016-04-27 20:33:36,One important change,"LinkedIn has helped me with my just starting web design career with networking.

The problem is when sending a friend request on mobile you do not get the option to send a message saying how you know this person. I have had many speakers come to my professional studies class who say ""please send a message with your request so that I can remember you, if you don't I might not hit accept"".
So I would say this is an essential addition you should add to the mobile app.",4
2016-05-26 00:38:20,Love this App!,"LinkedIn usage on this App is in many ways even more valuable then the desktop version. LI and its developers have ""nailed it"" with creation of this hugely convenient, user intuitive version of LinkedIn. As someone in the executive search business I can't live with out my iPhone and now I can't live without LinkedIn mobile. I can now reply to all I am in communications with in ""real time""...how can you put a price on that? One word describes this for me: invaluable'",5
2016-04-30 18:05:33,Just realized I'm on this app a lot,I remember once in a while jumping on the app to update something on my resume or accept a connect from someone I just met. Nowadays I find myself on it for the articles connecting with colleagues on their birthdays an promos. Work relationships/family are much different than personal ones there are epic battles you experienced with these people that can only be appreciated by them and not mixed in with personal friends and family.,5
2014-12-29 23:04:39,LinkedIn iOS,"I really am hooked on the LinkedIn mobile iOS version. I use it every day to post, network, and read updates. It has easy to use navigation. It did take a couple of times to remember where the share interaction shows up. Only on Home. Would like it elsewhere. The desktop version is just as good. Not necessary excited with the iPad app. Navigation is not as simple too follow and seems to have limited features.",5
2016-01-15 13:59:10,Way too annoying,"LinkedIn used to be a more serious social media. Now it has become a most annoying app with all the suggestions and ""say congrats"" and ""such and such liked this or that"" really??? WHO CARES? People are smart enough to go and search for the things they find valuable. I don't need LinkedIn to bombard me with crap, a useless feed I always ignore, job offers that have nothing to do with my career, and one more thing... If you aren't going to let me look who has seen my profile, WHY THE HELL do you need to show me how many people have seen it? Trying to lure me into paying a subscription? Forget it. I pay when I find value not when I sense someone is trying to get my $",1
2016-01-03 21:10:40,"CRASHING! Needs capability to view attachments(resumes, CVs)","First off, the app keeps crashing on my iPhone 5S running on the iOS 9.2; especially when I open my own profile. Additionally, to a majority of people, the resume or CV is the most important part of their LinkedIn profile (and also potential employers looking at a candidate). The attachments need to be able to be viewed using the mobile app... I just don't get why this hasn't been accomplished by the linkedin mobile application team yet.... It should be extremely simple to develop the platform.... Plus the whole app crashes now anyways so it's worthless. Fix these your competitor is creeping up on you faster than you think..",1
2015-12-10 12:20:47,Fix the update!,"Horrible App! The old app was better. Why don't new connections download to my address book? There is no setting for this like in the old app. According to the ""Help"" section this feature is available, but it's not! Also, how come I can no longer see my connections contact info when I go to their profile? Doesn't make any sense at all! This app is supposed to let me people connect and communicate in the professional world. Also, new connections don't show up anywhere at all. I only see a ""red badge"" alert but once I open up the app - POOF there's no other way to see how has connected with me or viewed my profile. FIX THIS APP! Everyone is having problems.",1
2015-03-09 00:56:47,Settings from web version need to work in app,"LinkedIn provides some settings to control your content - in the web version.  I prefer to see updates from companies and organizations, not dozens of ""Jill has 3 new connection"" messages. On the web, I do see mostly organizations.  On the app, those settings have no effect, and are not available. 

The newest implementation of the app highlights the ""social"" side so much that I see virtually no information from organizations.  If I wanted a Facebook account, I would have one. 

Please: give us options on the app so that we have a PROFESSIONAL site, not a parade of connection builders.",2
2014-12-13 06:59:23,More intuitive and user friendly,"Overall flow is better and easier to maneuver. Being a jobseeker, I use both the app and desktop version quite frequently. The app version has gotten much better and is only lacking understandable error descriptions. Also, there's not much direction for online assistance, when you do hit a snag. Thats a minor issue when weighed against the excellent professional networking experience provided.",5
2014-08-27 21:47:04,Setting the bar for networking apps,"LinkedIn has been setting the bar for networking apps since it's introduction. The updates and app layout have lent beautifully to my own functionality on the site without having to boot-up a laptop. With their latest format it's been even more fun and easy to use than other popular apps including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. LinkedIn is King--in my humble opinion--and they deserve the vast user-ship they've accrued...",5
2017-09-02 15:43:14,It All comes down to Relationships,"And LinkedIn is the best platform for your professional network. Not only it creates a space to introduce yourself and share your value and opinions, but also it creates such convenient and useful ways to expand your network and most of all, ways to stay connected. 

I consider LinkedIn as a very considerate and practical tool for modern day professionals to build and maintain relationships which is a foundation of your career life.",5
2013-11-02 10:46:20,Notifications are nice but...,"I pretty much only use the app in response to notifications received on other channels like email or when I am bored and see the badge count on the app creep up. Why?  Because finding people is just too cumbersome and the rest of information that it presents is not interesting to me.
That said, the app itself is done well enough and although a tad invasive I do like the way it has cross-linked contacts from my addressbook so now I know where these people work today

Overall 3 stars then. More a reflection of LinkedIn the service than the app",3
2012-05-26 20:52:38,Can't edit profile & no search...,"After LinkedIn being all over the news for being so successful and profitable, they have failed miserably with this app.  100% useless...  At least we didn't have to pay for it.  You CANNOT edit your own profile and you CANNOT search for anyone that you are not already linked to.  Trying to find a new contact that someone just referred you to?  Sorry, you CAN'T do that on this app!!  Do you want to edit your own profile?  Sorry, you cannot do that on this app!!

This is suppose to be a professional networking tool, not a useless app.  Get with it LinkedIn, and design an app that actually has a point, and not some half-assed piece of garbage.",1
2016-02-12 14:28:42,Great way to use LinkedIn on the go,"I have found the LinkedIn app to be a solid performer, able to accomplish the types of on-the-go tasks I want from a mobile app. 

My only suggestion and the reason for a 4-star rather than a 5-star review is the obscurity of adding a new contact. The ""let us access your contact list"" option is pushed so hard for this rather than simply allowing me to enter the name of an associate I wish to add to my network. LinkedIn is for business, not general social networking.",4
2016-02-03 15:28:15,New Version is Not Good,"I love LinkedIn and use it regularly. The old app was well set up and properly updated when new messages were read. This new app's layout is not very user friendly, which I can deal with. However I am constantly annoyed when my app doesn't update to reflect that I have already read the 9 messages I've gotten on LinkedIn over the past 3 days, on LinkedIn itself. So when I see the app icon saying it's got 9 messages waiting for me, and I open the app, and there's actually none, I usually just quit the app and forget about it.",3
2016-01-15 13:42:23,Misleading update notifications,"The update notifications on My Network tab are misleading.  I open my app to see a red indicator and think maybe I have a new connection request and it's just an update on someone's birthday or job anniversary? Silly and annoying.  Red indicators are for things you need to act upon. In the app, focus on messages and connection requests.  I'll find all the other updates if and when I have time to peruse my network feed.  I shouldn't have to feel like I have to go there just to clear the unimportant cards away so I can read my other feeds in peace, without a red flag hanging there distracting me.",2
2015-12-18 15:41:41,Losing Usefulness,"The usefulness of LinkedIn is declining. The app overloads you with ads for things it contains. Recent changes to groups have significantly devalued the primary benefit of using LI. Recent interface changes make it feel airy and things went missing. Moving from something solid in my routine toward another useless vaporware item cluttering my home page and inbox.

Update: 12/18 latest changes tremendously diminish already diminished functionality. Basically a news feed with lots of off-topic ads. Groups are destroyed. Pushing groups and pulse to independent apps complicated rather than improves. I'm not looking for more apps to do things this formerly did well. Reducing rating from 3 stars to 1.",1
2015-12-05 17:07:35,Basically useless now,"I really don't like this update. Too many things I actually used are gone. The picture block (new connections of connections), spell check is horrible, seeing all contacts you have in common not just the first ten, seeing all employees of a company, companies I follow or my connections follow, all groups I'm a part of and not just some - same for my contacts, the ability to see who is congratulating connections on promos and job changes, etc. instead of a direct instant message, NOT being able to see any of my connections connections!!!!  I admit the look is nice and clean but jeez the other stuff actually had value. It looks like I'm not the only one.",1
2015-09-17 20:48:15,Simple fixes,"If the Linked In people are listening, I need two simple fixes.   First, every time I get a note of a Linked In message on my iPad, and I click on it, it doesn't go straight to the application -- it takes me to the App store, where it checks to see if I need an update.   It's a pain, and if there's something I need to do to better mesh the app and my email, I wish I knew.

Second, I use linked in for the network but for recordkeeping and finding things later prefer email.   There is no easy way I've found to forward a linked in message to my email for archiving, etc.   Linked In  does a great service, but like Facebook, I'm not impressed with the ""walled garden"" in messaging.",1
2015-04-28 04:26:23,Notifications Are Always Showing A Day Off???,"Every time I receive a notification my profile has been viewed, it always says the previous day instead of today's date?? When I know for sure it was the same day? I experimented with the notifications with a friend's account? So, in return... Statistics are usually inaccurate for the day of and I receive delayed information sometimes. However, for basic searches and content relating to companies and people I am following... The app does help pass the time while I am waiting to go into a meeting, etc. On-going issues for me on my iPad app as well....",2
2012-08-10 21:13:53,Not designed for the correct use case,"If you think about what an ideal LinkedIn app would do, you can see it being useful for things like taking pictures of business cards at conferences and automatically adding contacts to your network along with notes. Or quickly reviewing who know know from a certain company when you're in a meeting discussing a potential client or partner or threat. The current app focuses too much on content, which is not LinkedIn's core value proposition. I spend at least 2 hours on LinkedIn every day, but less than 2 minutes of it is on the iPad. I'm a LinkedIn fan but a LinkedIn-app hater.",2
2012-06-18 12:41:37,delete this app,"The only mention of the password leaf was from media outlets. Linked In made no mention of it. No email to users explaining what happened, what it means to you,Mehta they did in response, what you should do. They just pretended it didn't happen. 

Now they are broadcasting your personal info without consent, and allowing other users to see who has viewed their profiles, which completely changes the user experience for the worse.  

Modern professionals need a networking site/app, but this can't be it.  Since it was created, I've always hated the interface, and wished someone would create a competitor that was worth a crap. a real opportunity for some developer out there.",1
2012-03-10 20:08:59,Clicking links from email to App dont work,"The new updates look good, but they take some time to get used to. But when reading LinkedIn emails from my device and clicking to go to the LinkedIn app. It routes me to a page asking me to install the app (which I already have)! This is extremely annoying when the particular article you want to read is not easily found (frustrating!!!) if you go to the app or log onto LinkedIn. Please fix this!!! I have a iPhone 4s but the same problem was happening on iPhone 3s, and my LinkedIn app has been updated as needed.",2
2011-08-29 13:32:01,NOW it is useful.,"Not sure whether the comments below are for an old version or what.  But this latest has group integration, a ""you may know"" feature with smarts (for the first time I actually DID want to invite some of the recommended people, not sure whether this uses my contact directory to improve recommendation order but it is better by far), readability, notifications, all much better.  This is actually usable on my iPhone!!!!!  GO TEAM!",5
2011-08-17 02:05:34,Great new look & feel but breaks Twitter sharing,"This update to the LinkedIn iPhone app is a major improvement to the look and feel of LinkedIn. It's by far one of the best looking social media apps available for the iPhone. 

However what limits this update from getting 4 stars or higher is the fact that this update seems to have removed the ability to also share a LinkedIn post with your Twitter account which I used extensively. Hopefully that was an oversight and not a purposeful omission that gets resolved quickly through another minor update.",3
2017-08-03 07:14:17,Very functional app and great program!,"I can do almost anything on this app! 

The only other things I wish I could do is log into another account on the same phone and post a photo & link at the same time. I have a personal and business account and I have to use the internet for the business account because my personal is on the app. When logging in/out of each one on the app, I receive errors.",5
2016-10-08 14:42:17,Uninstalled,LinkedIn is like the shoes they tell you you have to get but that don't actually have shoelaces or soles. I've never gotten a job there and mostly I just get marketing inspirational self-promotion and even a stalker. I kept pulse for a while but even that got tired and irrelevant. I kept the groups app (hate apps that make you download 4-6 other apps when they could figure out better options for switching between functions). LinkedIn will never change. But you have to list there as a professional dead see scroll type thing so you can say you tried finding a reason to use LinkedIn.,2
2016-05-07 21:41:27,Linked In keeps involving like a great company should,"Hi all,
I have been a member of Linked In for a while. This gives me the perspective on how it's product as grown and evolved.
I teach marketing and I always tell students companies must constantly evolve or some else will and take the business away from them.
I can sincerely say Linked In has been constantly in the right way and in the right directions and that is why it is the successful company that it is.",5
2015-12-17 03:58:41,"Five stars for the app in general, three starts for latest update","I love this app so much. I use LinkedIn 24/7 and it's one of my most used apps. I love all the little details about my profile and the home page. However, the latest update doesn't improve the app but it only changed how the app looked and i still can't view all the notifications, although i get many notifications but I can't see them all! 
Thank you!",5
2016-02-06 21:20:19,Reliable app… well reliably crashes,"First, I'd like to call out all the good things in the app. I really enjoy the messaging Application and I'm happy to see that LinkedIn has updated their messaging strategy.

Now the bad stuff. Every time I use the messaging app that I like, the application decides to crash. This is especially true if it tries to reload the homepage feed. Add to that the inability to find important parts of the application – like the invitations – and I'm left feeling very underwhelmed. I'm glad people enjoy the fact that the application was fixed for iPad, but in many ways it's worse than the previous application and I'm sort of stuck using it because there's nothing else.",1
2016-01-07 17:01:58,TERRIBLE APPLICATION !!,"The most recent, and past versions, of the LinkedIn app are by far the worst applications I have encountered in my ten years of Apple products use. I get the fact that they want you to sign up and pay for the ""pro,"" version, but give me a break. The app is constantly saying that there is no internet connection, not to mention the countless issues I have had through out the networking process. It would be nice if these bugs were fixed and i could accomplish the searches that I desire, then we would be getting somewhere. I was DEFINITELY NOT impressed with the older versions, and even more frustrated with the newer one. Aaaaaaahhhhhhh 😡😡😡😡😡😩😩😩😤😮😤😤😫😫😫😭😭😭",1
2014-09-13 16:39:19,Not Integrated with iPad,"Emails received from LinkedIn with links to LinkedIn articles, profiles, etc. never actually open your LinkIn app on the iPad. This is very frustrating for users that are hoping that the Email Notifications from LinkedIn would actually be useful. I am canceling email notifications, and will not pay for additional services from LinkedIn until this is fixed. There are many people with similar concerns for more than a year now. Just search the web and you will see this is not a user setup or configuration issue, but is a bug that has not been addressed by LinkedIn.",2
2015-12-10 11:46:25,Why can't we use 0 stars?,"See the HUGE difference in ratings between ""all versions"" and this current one? There used to be half again as many 5 stars as 1, now there are 10 times as many 1 stars. It not that we need to just get used to the new app, it is that it is terrible and unusable. 

I only started using the app a month before version 9 and was starting to get used to the layout and liked it. Now you turned one app into 7??? Job search, that's a different app... Groups, here download another app... I will be deleting this one, not downloading a bunch more.

2015-07-21 03:17:18,Innovative,Linked In has been a breakthrough in narrowing the search for the ever evolving work life.

This is horrible and might be a Harvard Business case review one day in MBA classes as an example of a company making a massive wrong decision and then not listening to their customer base.

This latest version/update is one of the worst I've experienced in quite a while from any app. Basically, the latest version is relatively useless with very limited features and has prompted me to delete it all together.  The portrait only viewing is ridiculous and I sincerely hope the developers will pay attention to what is being said on these reviews and go back to the original version. Maybe then I'll come back. Until then I'll stick with web access only. Thanks a lot LinkedIn for nothing! What were you guys thinking?",1
2012-11-01 18:49:42,Not bad- a goo alternative to the LinkedIn website,"The LinkedIn app is a good free application that members can use in lieu of the website. The only problem is that you can't look up companies using the normal search bar method. There's a ""search for people"" search bar that you can use to search for people, but you can't search for companies using that same bar.

The down side is klunky, slow UI that has been the case all along, with obviously no skills and interest in improving it. Sure, there's an app for that now, but it's still among the slowest user experiences of ALL web sites, period.

Too bad with all of the talent signed up here, LI can't find the talent to fix it ten years on. I have a VERY fast ISP, so that's why I know it's not me. 3 stars is a generous rating given the fails.",3
2015-06-23 22:55:14,What is expected from a free app,I think that this is a decent app for creating a virtual CV. You only get out of it what you put in regarding your professional history. People can look you up and you can do the same. Of course LinkedIn would like to generate revenue from their product so if you want a better interface and product offering you will need to upgrade your account. LinkedIn has been out for awhile now and I think that it's time for them to do something new in their industry. Let's see the next innovative service or product!,3

For instance, I attempted to join a group, however I received an error that I must leave one of the groups I'm in before I may join another. Unfortunately the functionality to leave a group is not available via the mobile app or mobile web site. This is one of the many tasks that are impossible without a computer. It's time for LinkedIn to realize that the mobile moment occurred years ago. Users expect and need to have full functionality via mobile. Until this is resolved it's a 1-star app.",1

So it ended up letting people I don't wanted to having my info and knowing I was on LinkedIn, knowing what I do. They I got emails from people I don't like to talk to WHAT THE...!!!!!!

Then I realized they are sending invite to people in your address book without your knowing on your behalf to get people to meet each others the problem here again is the same you might not necessarily want that every single of your contact know about linked in since it is supposed to be for pro use not like a facebook like webside.

Then they removed my pict from my profile because it wasn't a picture but a logo.....

2013-01-14 09:56:18,LEARN FROM ME...,"8000+ reviews and I have been reading all comments for 15 min- all one stars. So I figure...

This app makes one want to drive off a cliff like Thelma & Louise. At least when one darts off a cliff, one gets some speed which is more than I can say for this crap app, which one could liken to a turtle who has decided to ""slow down"" in life.

Did you know that the distance between the inside of your elbow and the crease of your wrist is the exact length of your foot? No foolin'... You know you are about to measure.

Now then... The users of LinkedIn just got more info from my stupid little review in 10 seconds than they got from this stupid website all year. True story. 

Did you also know that a site that gives you a ""message inbox"" can put a copy of YOUR INCOMING MESSAGE to THEIR INBOX? Stick to regular email. 

Now then. That's TWO PIECES of information you learned from me today... Which is more than you probably learned from LinkedIn in the last 3 years. Amen?

I should get a job as a standup comic. I am funny $&@%. 

Adios LinkedIn.",1
2012-09-08 19:48:14,All in one basket,Even though I used to use Facebook everyday or I should say every minute. That spot light has shifted towards LinkedIn. Why? The answer is simple. Because LinkedIn offers all in one service. With recent news to recruitment. One stop recommendation to directly connecting with recruiter. Simply the best. I hope the notion of being the best doesn't stop LinkedIn to try out something new for the future of professional terminal of human interaction!,5
2015-02-21 03:19:15,"Good Idea, but Very Very Poor Support; Zero Stars","Two weeks ago I made a very minor change to a recommendation I wrote for my physical trainer. My trainer approved the minor change, but the entire recommendation has nevertheless disappeared into LinkedIn limbo. After multiple emails and two weeks of elapsed time to LinkedIn support, there is zero progress. I asked two questions which still have not been answered: 
1. Once I have submitted the recommendation and my trainer has approved it, how long does it normally take LinkedIn to approve and post the recommendation?
2. Can the approval and posting process be expedited and quickly posted?
As a paying customer,I find this performance to be unacceptable.",1
2014-10-01 03:15:59,Buggy iPad activity feeds after iOS 8 update,"The feed is showing all sorts of weird things, like random contacts 'connecting' to other contacts who do not know each, and contacts supposedly ""joining"" another contact, as if the latter were a group.

I am not seeing these errors on the main website or, strangely, on the iPhone.  Tried reinstalling, to no avail.  Poor testing by the LinkedIn techies.  

Otherwise, the app continues to be kinda 'meh,' with limited functionality compared to the website.  Limits are to be expected, but basic features like updating one's profile should be on the app.",2
2014-07-29 19:37:30,Recent issue with sending invites to my contact list,"I recently sent a Linkedin  invite to a single individual however by accident I selected my entire contact list.  Now everyone is getting invites over and over without me doing anything.  I stopped logging in to Linkedin after this started and last night I shut off access to my contact list by LinkedIn from within Chrome.  I'm hoping this resolves the issue. Other than this, I've liked the app as far as keeping up-to-date with my business/professional friends.",3
2009-03-17 14:33:12,"Poor UX, flaky UI","I really don't see the point of this app. It crashes like crazy and has such limited functionality that other than tweeting out a status update, it's just a reader. The tap targets are not well baked either, which is where I find it to be crash-prone. There's no reason other than developer laziness why this app should be so useless. Perhaps LinkedIn doesn't take iPhone users seriously but quite a few of us work in the interactive/dev space so it's a huge gamble to offer up a toy in lieu of an app and expect that to fly.

Requests //
+ fix the flaky UI which freaks out if I go to one of the targets on the slider or try and post an update;

+ make this work more like LinkedIn does, add in better editing functionality for user profiles etc;

+ true search capability;

+ add in the ability to find and make connections which is the whole raison d'être of this service.

I like LinkedIn's UX on the web. I just need some serious attempt to being that to the iPhone. Thanks!",1
2015-08-12 20:12:15,Great app - one minor suggestion,"I love using LinkedIn. One suggestion: I'm wondering if you could add another level of ""Experience"" for users to be able to further differentiate between their work history? For example, your users who are recent graduates may have a number of part time jobs separate from internships and having the ability to group these in this way would be helpful in keeping the profile clean and easier to view by other users.",4
2017-09-20 14:51:48,LinkedIn is the worst for Privacy,"I want more control over what information is visible on my profile and I want the ability to deactivate temporarily. If I want to take a break from Linkedin, I should be able to do so without having to start from scratch with a brand new profile when I'm ready to come back. I know people have been asking for this option for years and yet they continue to ignore it. You're dealing with people's careers and professional lives here, there could be infinite reasons that someone would want to limit their visible information or completely take a break from LinkedIn for a while. It's really not asking a lot.",1

Importantly, LinkedIn is an excellent tool for those just beginning a career as well as those well established in their fields.",5
2017-02-14 11:29:13,Professional Career Search,"This app has helped connect me with a larger network of unique individuals. Sometimes, it's just a good way to look  for enlightening articles. I have even landed a good paying career through Linkedin because it narrowed down my skill levels and chose the right kind of jobs for me to look into. Over looked, but very good app to take time and create a portfolio on. This has helped cut time when applying sometimes.",5
2016-02-25 22:54:15,I expected so much more,"Lacks a lot of basic things that most other social media has. With all the hype and how vital LinkedIn has become I expected so much more. For one, where is the Facebook integration? There were people who I searched for and could not find until I synced my contacts. How many more connections am I missing that could be found through Facebook integration like that found on Instagram. Hopefully there are some updates coming. This app and even the website seem to be lacking some major features",3
2015-10-17 10:17:57,App messaging is terrible!!,"I usually don't write reviews but in this case I had to say that the LinkedIn app is terrible!!! About 50% of the time I try to to respond to a message in my inbox, I can't send my message out. It just says that it's failing to send and that there's a connection problem. As a result, I  have to go into my desktop version on my Chrome App and then access and send my LinkedIn message from there. I'm on full wifi bars here, so I know it's not a network wifi issue.

Can you guys please fix it? Either that or add an automatic defect tracker for when these problems occur so you can debug.

Thanks!",2
2015-05-10 23:08:19,Love it- one improvement,"Love this app! Use it everyday for much more than networking. I keep up with news on people and companies that matter to my business, read articles etc

Is there a way to ""favourite"" or ""save"" an article or piece of writing? I know you can ""like"" it but that's not what I want. Like just a section to favourite articles and content without the entire news feed knowing what you're liking (not always relevant to them, often none of their business)",4
2015-08-09 05:47:28,"Poor Messaging and No, I don't want to connect my contacts","For a service that is all about connecting the in-app-messaging is terrible. It constantly hangs up when sending and either just doesn't send or crashes the app. I have had several messages I have just given up on because I've had to retype it three times. It seems like the second it crosses a certain character count it loses its mind and short circuits. 

Also, I am tried of the screen take over every time I open the app asking me for access to my contacts. I have told it no 64x before. Stop asking. It's ridiculous.",2
2015-05-27 22:19:42,New Link website,"I have to say I have put it off for a long time as I also use Facebook which is great but I find that this is more intimate faster friendly I enjoy it and I've only just begun 😍
If you're not using it I would highly recommend it I think you'll really enjoy it again it's very fast smooth and the best thing is so many of my friends family stepdaughter's son are available and that means a lot to me👍🇺🇸",5
2014-07-28 10:25:31,Great for networking but App needs work.,"The concepts behind LinkedIn is great. Your networking and endorsements can be extensive and and valuable. 
You can ""subscribe"" to updates and advise from senior players in your field that really saves you from making mistakes and bad strategic career-moves. 
But...the app itself is clumsy! Why this cannot be addressed properly is beyond me. After using the app both on phone and pad for 2 years now, I can only conclude; the App needs a much awaited overhaul to be more intuitive for the user.",4
2015-02-12 16:33:35,Disappointing,"It seems to me that linked in is just another way to post your resume online. The majority of my connections are not professional (ie friends and family) who ""endorse"" me for skills they know nothing about. I get emails from LinkedIn begging me to sign in, update my profile, etc but the only professionals looking at my profile are not at all related to my career goals and only vaguely related to my work experience. And the groups I've joined are contaminated with posts that are either commercial (buy their product) or inappropriate (personal ads seeking employment). LinkedIn is not what it claims to be, at least for my profession. All I get is false hopes and a waste of time.",1
2015-02-06 01:31:44,Great app,LinkedIn is probably my most used app on the phone after email and news. I like it for its features and I will continue using it. The mobile version is easy to use and does what it is supposed to do. Left 1 star just because sometimes I get 'oops something is broken' error which does not get resolved quickly and  for the absence of some features available only on the web version.,5
2012-01-13 21:21:43,Getting where it needs to be,"The LinkedIn app is finally getting to where it needs to be. I used this version on a business trip and was able to search for new contacts I had met, send them invitations to connect and look up their Twitter handles so that I could connect with them there. I was also able to check my In Box and respond to a message. Once I had finished doing all this I realized how useful this app has become.",4
2013-08-01 12:40:46,Clumsy hard to navigate interface,"Getting the information you need quickly is difficult, if not impossible, in the app. Navigating the application is clumsy, especially with regards to messages and responding to invites with anything other than an accept. it needs to be more intuitive to get between core functions like messages, connection profiles, and news feeds.

On the upside, it doesn't crash nearly as often as other apps on the  iPad 1st generation. 

Overall, I usually use a browser to access my LinkedIn account. Plus I get more control over what cookies are used and not accepted.",2
2012-10-30 13:10:11,Generally a good app,"but the interface still needs to be cleaned up so if will make more sense. It's a bit wonky in how one searches for other users, for example, and apparently connection requests can't be customized when sent from here as they can be when sent from the web site. This doesn't have all the features of the LI site, but it's hard to tell which ones it has!

It would be simpler to log in if the app remembered username/email address so only one's password had to be entered each time.

No landscape mode is a major deficit, especially when reading an article displayed in gnat-sized type.",2
2012-06-27 00:16:32,The iPad app is horrible!,"This is one of the worst apps I've installed from a reputable company.  I had the iPhone app installed on my iPad before they released this and never had an issue.  Not only is the iPad app less functional than the IPhone app (inbox is non-intuitive, can't jump to contacts by letter, scrolling through them is painfully slow, even finding an invite requires you to tilt the screen to portrait orientation, etc.) which makes absolutely no sense, but the dang app crashes left and right, even after reinstalling.  I can't believe a publicly traded technology company would put out something so bad.  You waited long enough, at east wait until you get it right.",1
2016-01-06 20:47:26,LinkedIn for professionals,"It's a great starting point in your networking phase of marketing. You still need to reach out and connect, write and attach relevant articles, join relevant groups and in general, market yourself to your potential clients, employers and vendors. It should be mandatory for all graduating students to build their on screen personas. Connect to people who can improve your career. And learn things by reading some of the posts. Great for researching people and companies. And, if you do it right, get headhunted.",4
2017-01-22 15:06:42,Segregating the features into app ruined it for me,"Having to view 4 apps to get done all of the different tasks I need to do just kills LinkedIn for me now. So disappointed with this app. I also keep getting errors when trying to refresh my network on this app. I can't search for people not in my network if I don't go to the discover app and trying to look through jobs at a glance is painful!!! If the average user only uses 5 apps daily how you do expect your 4 to make the top 4 out of 5?! Short term. Please fix the network settings to stop the errors!! Long term. Tear down these app walls and bring the app back into one! It's 2017, no need for this segregation.",1
2016-04-03 23:17:59,"LinkedIn App is OK, sometimes annoying","I slightly prefer the full LinkedIn Web site. You can really struggle trying to navigate through the same information on this mobile application. What really lowers my opinion of the mobile is the incessant requests to Link to all my contacts stored on my phone. For quick tasks such as accepting Link request the app is fine. Also, the Web version is constantly being ""improved"" with often times mystery navigation added. Both the Web and mobile application are getting annoying to use. LinkedIn should fire their UI staff.",2
2015-09-30 17:53:55,Beware of email data mining,"LinkedIn is clearly using this mobile app to mine my gmail account. Today LinkedIn suggested I connect to someone in the ""people you may know"" area that I had recently emailed only once and I have no mutual LinkedIn connections with. To be clear, I have never allowed LinkedIn to connect to my gmail or retrieve my contacts. The only things that have access to my gmail (per gmail's security site) is iOS and my iPhone. So the only way LinkedIn could have suggested I connect with this person is if it is using this LinkedIn iPhone app to mine through my gmail. LinkedIn shows a blatant disregard for my privacy and I have lost all trust in them.",1
2013-05-21 11:40:17,"Timely, well-written","Software is ""what I do,"" from coding to deploying to training, and this app is great! I'd tweak a few things -- allow people to specify whether they want to stop a particular update from being published, allow stored resumes to be sent, modify accomplishments, but I owe a new job to LinkedIn mobile, and you can use it as an extension of your résumé. Use it in conjunction with other mobile apps and all you're contacts can merged and in the same place. It's just a concise, smart app! Thanks, LinkedIn!!",4
2014-10-04 23:33:58,Invite function broken,In the mobile app there was once a very handy way to invite people if you just met them and had their business card. This functionality has inexplicably disappeared. I have contacted LinkedIn support and have received no satisfactory answer to this problem. I have a big stack of business cards from recent meeting where I cannot add these people as connections. This function was probably the single most useful function in LinkedIn without it LinkedIn is nearly USELESS. I don't think anyone at LinkedIn is paying the slightest attention to this because I am not the only one complaining about this now busted feature.,1
2012-06-14 06:44:36,Linked,"The LinkedIn app does a good job at displaying news, which is one of my main app usage areas. I'd like to opt out of the calendar feature and don't know that it's possible...somewhat frustrating. Also, I have the most up-to-date version, but keep getting a ""something went wrong.."" message, so I haven't been able to post, email, or share any content this last week. I'm sure this will soon be repaired (?). 

Overall, it's primary functions serve their purpose - I'm happy.",4
2017-06-29 18:24:50,App works nicely,The application works nicely and I feel linked in is improving in content and usefulness. Articles by influencers are often well thought out and appropriate for a work social media environment.  The canned congrats and thank you messages are a little stiff but with time people will get a bit more creative. A couple years ago I thought there was no point being on linked in. Now I think the platform has a relevant future as the professional social platform.,4
2009-09-30 02:19:30,Careful with this app in Edge networks,"You MUST force the app to sign off (select it in settings) when you exit.I have OS 3.1, since the upgrade when this app is logged in, I am not able to receive phone calls OR get Visual Voicemail on the phone in Edge networks. Even if I am connected to a Wireless network, I am still unable to receive calls or notifications.Operation in 3G networks is spotty. I sometimes get calls and VM prompts, but usually not.I suspect this problem occurs with any application that keeps the network ""hot"" all the time. But this app is the one I traced my problem down to.",2
2016-10-27 12:28:01,Networking made easy,"I have had LinkedIn for several years. It is only been the last year that I have utilize this tool more. I think it's because the enhanced with me to the newsfeed, your profile, and connecting with others is seamless. The UI is very clean and intuitive, and I even like the additional coffee stickers in the messaging center. Great job, and thank you for making tool that makes networking easy.",5
2014-07-01 17:57:39,Excellent Professional App,"A must to have tool to maintain your Resume, Skills, Experiences, and past job positions update....!  This is base on your co-workers and anyone you have working in your field of expertise jobs...!  Also, this app will keep you update with news and new tecniques found in today's market and business for new jobs, new resume input, preparing for a speech or a meeting, a class, etc. In summary, if you are working you need this app period...!",5
2016-10-22 10:23:52,Problem with notifications,"I get banner/alert notifications on my home screen. For example, it will notify me that I have a new connection. However, when I open the app any click on the notifications icon on the menu bar, on occasion, the notification screen does not reflect the new connection (it's almost always outdated). If the app fails to load the notification the first time, it won't ever load the notification, it does not update or refresh the notifications feed. Why does it do that?",3
2016-08-18 21:42:36,Overall great app but why so BIG,"Fast, fluid, intuitive. Biggest complaints would be not being able to view a profile (or ANYthing for that matter) in a browser format instead if the app, I.e., ""view this profile in..."".  Second complaint would be not providing an option to customize a LinkedIn request message (or even giving you an ""are you sure you way to send?"" feature).
Recently, the app's size on iOS has ballooned to 150+mb -- bigger than Facebook. Come on - get your app developers to rein in this bloatware.",3
2016-02-12 12:51:55,Could be better,"Don't give me wrong, this is a great application for using LinkedIn on the go. My main issue with this app is the fact that whenever you click a LinkedIn email link, this program wants to hijack the web traffic by asking you if you want to open it in the app. Whenever you say yes, it will take you to your updates/news feed, no matter what. It won't take you to the message or profile link you clicked on; it only redirects you to the app, leaving you with a disjointed user experience.",3
2016-01-10 17:41:44,It's that bad,"I don't believe that I've ever reviewed an app that I own but the 'new' LinkedIn is bad enough to get me to type a few words. It's not just bad as in ""I'll have to learn some new features"" but rather it's bad as in ""I've been using the new app for several weeks and I still don't get what the heck happened!"" Every time I open it I cringe. It's not intuitive, it's not user friendly, and everything that was awesome about the app before is now hidden, changed for the worse, or simply gone. It's one useful feature is that opening the new LinkedIn on my phone serves as a stark reminder  to me to get on my laptop if I want to effectively use LinkedIn in any manner.",1
2015-08-10 21:53:02,Decent--stop asking for contacts,"LinkedIn is great for networking and job searching. I've misty enjoyed the app. 

However, my biggest gripe is the app's insistence to access my contacts to ""find out who you know on LinkedIn."" I always hit cancel and never intend to give the app access. This should be remembered by the app; I should not have to remind it every few times that I don't want it to access contacts. 

Developers, please make this prompt disappear after canceling or say no the first time, or provide a setting to turn off this prompt.",3
2015-02-11 21:26:07,Constant sign in,"Once I get into the app it's fine, better than it used to be—but it's getting increasingly difficult to open the thing on a regular basis. It seems like it loses my login almost every day I get a notification to open it. I turned off background app refresh but it's  still happening. This wouldn't be as bad if it used touch ID but for people that don't have touch ID it would still be a problem. This behavior doesn't make me feel more secure using the app, it just makes me irritated and use the phone app less.",3
2015-01-06 04:30:27,Functions badly needed,"Great app compared to using linkedin online. However, you need to make it easier to delete contacts both on the website version as well as the iPad application. The function is severely complicated on the website version and it does not exist on the iPad and iPhone versions. You also need to add a ""Report"" button so that we can report fake profiles of African fraud gangs spreading messages like ""share your contacts as I have US$ 400 million that I want to split with you, but send me $2000 to send those 400 million to you"".",3
2014-08-08 03:06:26,Too many issues with tracking messages and invites,"Why this app can't get it together is beyond me. The inability to see on the mobile app that you have already messaged someone, invited them to connect or see your own message history is frustrating to say the least. 

Also has a severe flaw in wording of inviting new connections. I deplore the wording, ""since you are a person I trust, I would like to connect"". I use LinkedIn for business not to have friendships and relationships. 

So far standard feedback from God knows where says, ""we are aware of problems, but don't have a timetable to address""",2
2017-09-01 17:33:17,Being truly connected,"When you love your career and you exceed at it, sometimes it's not enough. You know what you have done but no one else does. LinkedIn lets everyone know what you know. It helps you build networks with people, companies, jobs, & careers. It's a living Resume that keeps you relevant and gives you access at your fingertips. I am so thankful I had a LinkedIn account and the LinkedIn app.",5
2013-12-23 12:40:16,Simple is not always better - any other choice?,"Unfortunately, after using LinkedIn through a browser, there are many - too many - differences and the app is significantly less robust.  Never mind the periodic crashes. The app just doesn't offer up as much as the site and what it does offer is unintuitive with tasks being less easy to execute than on the web.

In addition, every time you use the app, you have to re-enter your credentials as it empties the userid & pwd fields for sign in - with no way to control your settings .

How did they ever get this far - oh that's right, no real alternative...",2
2013-07-20 13:25:38,iPad version doesn't allow u to update ur profile,"Really?  Yes.  You HAVE to use an iPhone or a PC, you can not update any profile info on your iPad.  Boutelle, now that you've joined them, could you inject some of your brilliance into their iPad dev team?  I had to FIND my laptop to update my profile.  I thought PC's were dead.  Thankfully mine wasn't.  The experience diffs btwn the ipad, iPhone and pc versions of the app are dramatic.  Product strategy: don't ever do the same thing in the three products, exact use the branding.   Could you guys please spend some of that capital for your only value-delivery channels (your products)?",2

Million - to sign up; however, I think the App leaves much to be desired.

The flow could be better... My contacts, notifications - could work better, moving from window to window is not fluid. I think a home interface that lets you navigate where you want to go to is a better layout. Opening with news is not where I want to go on my app... Online is good, but in my app I want to go to my page and contacts... Not news stories.",2
2011-12-09 21:03:04,Last version was better,"It's a small change, but I don't like it. The navigation button used to be large and right in the center. Now it is tiny and in the far upper left corner. Yes, there is a new search tool, but couldn't this search bar be integrated into the old design?  I've downgraded my rating and am switching back to the previous version if I can.  Hopefully the developers will switch this back in a future release. Otherwise, the app has some very nice design features.",3
2014-08-13 18:31:42,Could be improved,The concept of the app website is great but the content is slim. It needs to be beefed up to make it more of a go to site or app. The app isn't user friendly and could do with being reworked. I do like the connectivity and ability to network with other professionals. I also think the yearly or monthly fee is very steep for the amount of content. I do like the app and have made a few connections but not sure if it is a viable source to use for gaining new employment.,4

The layout is weird and convoluted and there is always a constant notification icon within the app–whether it's to let you know about news updates or ""ghost"" messages–that is irritating. Since the most recent update, the app closes as soon as you open it.

Until the app is completely remade to be more user-friendly and these bugs are fixed (and seeing as how you have designers ON LinkedIn, maybe tap a few of them on the shoulder for help), I'll stick to just using LinkedIn on my laptop.",1
2015-08-27 03:31:45,Poorly designed App,"LinkedIn for the iPad is a really poorly designed application with missing functionality and lots of bugs.  For example, the App shows wrong info, which appear correct on the desktop and iPhone versions and there is no way to correct it.  It is actually frustrating to use. Using LinkedIn across the iPhone, iPad and desktop is very different and you have to remember where things are and what doesn't work where.  They should've kept one interface and preserved the same user experience across all devices.  What a missed opportunity!!",2
2015-01-14 05:10:06,"Good social media site, app could use improvements","The social media side of LinkedIn is no doubt very professional and effective. However, there are small little quirks and nuances about the app and how it functions in relation to what it does upon interacting with it. Like when your ""connection"" is accepted you want to see their profile...instead it shows you a list of potential people who you might want to connect with. The connection is not clickable till you do a search. Quite annoying. Otherwise the site is good.",3

And when I go to click on the link in my phone it takes me to the website login page where I am also given a choice to go to the app. But if I click on that choice to go to the app I just end up on the generic home of the app. What I would like is a link directly from those emails that I receive to the highlighted content within the app on my iPhone.",4
2015-07-23 01:04:38,Good App - Mobile and desktop sync and messaging,"Good app. Great to have on p1. Had some suggestions on improving the mobile messaging. Doesn't save drafts when I occassionally lose connection and lose my draft messages and have to start over. Messages on mobile don't always appear on the desktop. 

Also, accepting LinkedIn invites off email on mobile don't always appear on the desktop version. 

Not complaining. Good app. Messaging is one area for improvement.",4
2013-04-07 17:05:33,App designed by people who don't use it,"Definitely a sub-par app. As a social space, the LinkedIn app does nothing to make a user return, stay or even use it. User experience is extremely poor. 

One example? Regular update emails will for instance prompt you to accept an invite to connect. Clicking on accept sends you to a ""get the app!"" page then the App Store, even if you already have the app! Apparently they have so little confidence in their product that they didn't even imagine you might actually already have the app...

Skip this app and just use LinkedIn from your computer.",2
2012-11-02 02:13:53,Overall great app,"LinkedIn's app and web experiences are both pretty excellent and improving monthly. 

I feel like they are doing all the right things to get me engaged with their site and groups. And the user experience is solid in both channels.

Probably my only complaint would be some issues with the email functionality if replies via the app. I often get errors or it seems to not send or lose emails. Looking at an interface where emails are grouped (both sent and received) by topic (sort of like iPhone email does it / MS Outlook).",3
2017-07-19 14:29:22,Finally added the feature I requested!,"Now I'm able to see what/who I have in common with someone who requests to connect with me (or anyone else, for that matter). Just wish it didn't ask me to download their job-seeking app every time I click on the link to view jobs they think I might be interested in. It does show me the jobs in the current app after I click no thanks.",5
2017-04-20 17:44:36,Great app!,"Millions of connections in your pocket. LinkedIn is a social engineering marvel for the workforce. Just wish it didn't keep asking me to share my gmail or yahoo contacts. Just let people find each other organically. If you offer value, they will come. There is no need to force-load contacts. The app itself is extremely easy to use and has gotten really efficient over the years. Thank you.",5
2016-09-17 22:07:20,Use Daily for Must-Do Activites,"I run through all the suggestions made in this app once daily to make sure I'm active with my connections. It's easy and all you have to remember to do is customize the suggested messages to avoid being like a bot. I suggest this app to clients as a way to make sure they do the minimum activity needed daily. It doesn't replace desktop use, but it's a great place to start and to stay active with ease!",5
2016-06-23 07:49:10,Gospel lyrics creator,LinkedIn is the best place to build a network of people that believe in what each other does and it is even greater when you see people you never thought would come into LinkedIn. I can use just about anyone that is in a business or profession that is in here. They all give me inspiration to write different types of lyrics from there stories. LinkedIn is just awesome and wonderful.,5
2016-01-19 10:36:28,"""For Professionals""but New Version is Dumbed Down","I used to use this app a lot more. 

The user interface on the new version is overly simplistic and eliminates a lot of useful functionality. I don't really understand the logic of that decision. I have more control over my Facebook account trough their app, and LinkedIn is supposedly for professionals (who, you would assume, could navigate a little bit more complex yet function-rich environment). Instead they decided to dumb the whole thing down to be like Twitter. 

Hopefully they'll change it back, because until then I won't be using it nearly as much.",2
2015-12-28 03:18:06,Not fun anymore,"I've given this app a few weeks of use, hoping I would see and understand how it's ""improved"". While things look a little more organized than before and overall look and feel has improved, I just don't enjoy using the app as much anymore:
1.  Crashing is more frequent and responsiveness in screen changes are slower. 
2.  LinkedIn does not support apps like Flipboard anymore (i.e. I cannot share a LinkedIn post directly from Flipboard without the app crashing). This was a wonderful feature. Now I have to copy and paste. 
3.  Ads...too many ads in the feed. Dilutes and weakens the power of posts and shares to the point where I just ignore the feed. 

I used to look at this app once an hour or more during the day, especially in the couple of career transitions I've had. I've relied on it heavily for career insight for years. Now I'm ready to delete it and stick to the website. Not a fan.",2
2015-12-06 08:58:26,Ridiculously Poor Experience,It takes a lot for me to write a bad review for something but LinkedIn have really done it this time. Notifications are all over the place across several pages. I can't see more than 10 people in the 'People who viewed me also viewed' section. It used to be 50. The feed is an incoherent mess and the 'My Network' interface is horrendous. The profile page is pretty bad too. I understand that there is a learning curve when it comes to apps being redesigned but this is unacceptable especially being a LinkedIn premium member and dishing out $50+ per month. I'm probably going to cut away my subscription.,1
2015-09-16 13:33:01,"Not bad, plenty room to Improve","I really like this app, I use it quite regularly. My main issue is that it isn't user friendly. The app refreshes automotive often. If I am browsing the homepage & click a link, then click back to the home page, it takes me back to the top of my feed instead of allowing me to continue where I left off. Also, big killer, I can't view sent messages on the app! It's very annoying to not have a conversation thread. Please, if nothing else, add a 'Sent' messages box to the messages menu.",3
2013-11-19 11:42:33,"Lovin' it, but I need a little update","Great App! I really enjoy the business side of connecting via LinkedIn with friends & professionals. It's nice to see the linkage with companies, groups, articles, etc. 

However, I'd like to be able to print articles from the app (on my iPad mini) & maybe even be able to save / copy the pictures & diagrams that are embedded to the articles.

Thanks for a job well done & to the future improvements!!!",5
2014-12-30 18:20:11,Almost worthless for Groups,"Basic features like checking messages, viewing status, finding friends, etc. works fine. However, I belong to a number of groups and navigating through a long thread is possible. I can't even figure put the order in mobile. And I don't seem to be able to like a response, only the thread. Since group chatter is the most frequent reason I use the App, I've stopped using it. I wait until I'm at my laptop, which kind of takes the mobile out of mobile, doesn't it?",3
2012-03-01 15:02:35,Good but could use a few things,"The app is really clean and I like how it's set up. I can't figure out if you can edit your work experience on the app so if you can it should be easier to find. Editing your profile at all is not easily explained. Also I think it would be really great if there was the ""bump"" function. If you come across someone who has an iPhone and the LinkedIn app you could ""bump"" iPhones and connect that way.",4
2013-01-06 04:20:30,Very Close,"While I'm a fan of the overall UI, the UX needs a little more work. The app itself is fine for the most part, but when a user has the ""Download Connections"" feature enabled, it replaces the homepage of a current contact (or sets the homepage of a new contact) as linkedin://#profile/[Profile Number] instead of the homepage that the contact gave in their profile info, and I'd like to have the ability to disconnect from someone from the app.

Other than that small (but extremely irritating) issue, the app is great!",3
2012-06-17 13:46:07,Dead-end/loop when clicking links in L.I. Email updates,"When I get LinkedIn email updates, and click links in the email, you get stuck in a loop and can't get to you LinkedIn acct. example: click a person to see their updated profile or click link to get full details of a group discussion, then safari opens, tells me to get the app or no thanks. If I click the app, it takes me to app store and indicates it is ALREADY installed, then dead end. If I click "" no thanks"", then I see the in logo and the spinning wheel forever and again dead end. What's the point of the app if its not compatible with clicking links in emails. PS. I'm on iPhone 4s if it's a device glitch.",1
2012-01-07 07:40:23,Great app!,"Linked in actually has a great interface with iPhone. The app is very useful and works well with connecting to other social media and sharing items within the app. The only beef i have is that you cant edit your profile from the app, i.e. add experience, education, ect; but as far as extras go, and UI, best linked in app. And this is coming from an avid webOS and windows mobile user!",5
2017-07-20 17:25:17,As I See It,"Twice I have subscribed to a paid version of Linkedin, this time after a system overhaul. For the second time I find no value in the paid service. As other reviewers have stated, irrelevant messages pop up that I never opted in for -- and can't seem to opt out of. Additionally, 98% of the job listings I receive are for volunteer positions. IMO those are not ""job"" listings, and I do not need to pay a fee to find a place to serve my community.
It is always nice to stay connected, but I can do that without the subscription fee.",3
2017-06-01 14:58:39,WEAK POOR SUBSTITUTE FOR DESKTOP,"UPDATE. As of June2017 this app is poorly written, far below the usability of its desktop counterpart. I got this app as soon as it came out and it continues to disappoint. Very basic. I was hoping it would be equally as flexible, especially on the iPad, as the desktop version via a browser. One would think that with the increased real estate of the iPad Pro or phablets that LinkedIn would be tempted to up their game. LinkedIn has obviously not thought it is worth the effort to make it a serious contender for the role that competes with the desktop version. It continues to lack the options of its big brother. The iPhone version is equally disappointing.",1
2017-02-10 19:48:10,Convenient networking on the run,"The UIs are clean, robust, and navigation friendly. Important settings are easy to access. I like that i can add my phone's emoji's when posting updates and when sending congrats & quick messages to my network. I still use the Web version for major profile edits and article writing, but for day-to-day networking and reading the LinkedIn app for IOS is where it's at. 🤘🏼👌🏼🤙🏼",5
2016-08-17 14:00:20,Stay out of my way!,"I admit it: I am writing this review to express rage. 

I rarely use this app.  Every time I try, however, I am subjected to screen after screen of LinkedIn jamming itself down my throat.  No! I don't want to let you connect to my contacts!  No! I don't want to tell you all of my interests!  Just open and let me use the friggin app!

Having a ""Better Networking"" wizard available and even prominently featured in the app is a good idea.  But shoving my nose in it when I just want to open the app to check something has finally motivated me to delete the thing from my phone altogether.",2
2016-04-27 11:56:51,Sometimes better than the Desktop!,"This is a great app. It offers a slightly different perspective on my LinkedIn network from the desktop version. I sometime see thing in here I would have missed from the regular website.

I recently moved from Windows Phone and the app difference is night and day. This has great functionality and integration. Finally, I have what I was looking for before.",5
2016-03-02 11:16:19,Very Disappointed,"I've been a daily user of prior release of the app for many years. I didn't even know about updated version. 
Was looking forward to new updates and features after loading....
The app is just a train wreck! 
Overall, I would say that it looks unprofessional and is not a user friendly. Navigation is difficult especially if you are looking for features from last version! 
I am extremely disappointed in the app. It was something that I leveraged for business contacts and idea sharing. I will probably end up deleting the app and using website, if that's even still possible.",1
2016-02-24 21:59:32,Decent but overpriced.,"Linked in is a great networking tool. It's a a terrific resource to find folks in your industry and share professional news and information. 

That being said, the newly implemented restrictions for non-paying users has made it somewhat frustrating. And the pricing to pay for it, incredibly hard to swallow. Linked in is becoming less and less valuable to non-paying users, who, by the way, are the connections the paying users want to have access to.  

I also wish there was better functionality when reviewing notifications. There is a way, but it's not an easy one, to see new connections listed by how new they are. This option should be available when clicking on the notifications icon on the toolbar. 

Bottom line, decent app, but you are going to price yourself right out of business, Linked In.",3
2016-02-17 19:04:07,Thanks but no thanks,"While this used to be a useful way to manage my network, the newest version is not easy to use in any way. Between dialogs that have to be dismissed every single time you launch the app, and the utter lack of a help section or even a link to support/feedback within the app itself, you are left with a confusing mess of sneaky ways to try to harvest your contacts email addresses, and very little actual LinkedIn content. 

This used to be the go to method for me to manage LinkedIn, but the current version is about to get uninstalled from my phone.",2
2015-02-09 13:56:37,Great app and communication tool,"I think this is a great tool for all of the intended uses. It would be great to see additional enhancements and added features but I would not want to see it get too clunky and contain things that are not pertinent to professional contacts and relationships. 

So far so good. I have taken advantage of past relationships by hiring staff and keeping up with various networks of individuals. This has opened up new doors as well.",5
2014-04-23 18:18:50,No editing,"This site is a great site but on the iPad it lacks essentials. I cannot figure out how to edit my profile for here, change pictures, or anything else revolving around my profile. It's good if I just wanted to browse I guess but not being able to change my picture, upload pictures, change my profile around and those kinds of things are why I'm contemplating on whether or not this is a waste of memory on the iPad. I did try googling a solution and apparently there was a response from 2013 that they were working on fixing that so I know it's not just me. Regular computer is going to be my source for this site",1
2013-08-01 02:55:17,Annoying interface with mail,"No major complaints about the app itself once you're in. My beef is when you receive an email from LinkedIn and you click, say, on a connection, you are taken to a screen touting the marvels of the LinkedIn app for iPad.  Guess what? I'm on an iPad - which I assume you know since you're suggesting that I ""get the app"" - AND I have the app!! Why don't you know this? Why doesn't the app open when I click the hyperlink to my connection?  Makes having the app pointless about half the time.",3
2013-06-01 07:39:14,Masterful update and very impressive restructuring,"I enjoyed the old Linkedin iPhone app, but I really felt that there were some lag times with loading of pages, and that the way to view news and other content was a little clunky...this new update changes ALL of that, and I believe this same level of sophistication needs to be transplanted to the iPad as well. Kudos Linkedin mobile team on a job well done!",5
2012-04-26 16:44:18,Holy Crap!  LinkedIn just became AMAZING!,"At first, I really wanted a LinkedIn app for my iPad.  After awhile, I just stopped using the service.  They had an iPhone app, but I've never been into smartphones.  The iPad? It's essentially my left hand.

Then this came out.  I don't remember the site actually being a destination beyond Facebook-style activity.  I've been on today more than I visited the site in March!  It's perfect.  It's better than anything I was expecting!",5
2010-11-16 14:57:30,Would Like to Access Groups,"I have been using this app for about a year and it works fine, but it would be really nice if I could check updates and stuff from my groups. Just being able to  post updates, check others' updates, and other basic functions like that just isn't enough. So for the next update, would you please consider adding a way to access groups?",4
2017-04-13 05:55:11,Professional Facebook,"This is the professional Facebook, Instagram, Twitter all in one! LinkedIn lets me view the news I want to see and learn by scrolling through my news feed instead of waste time like the other social media ads. Along with the educational articles it also provides me with connections that I can grow throughout my college and full time employment after college.",5
2015-11-19 09:16:01,Autoredirecting users to App Store,"This review is based on the simple fact that LinkedIn does not respect users. When I visit LinkedIn on my phone, it automatically redirects me to the App Store. That is disrespecting users! My intent is to visit the LinkedIn website, so why is my intent intentionally subverted to get me to install their stupid app? First rule of UX design: respect user intent, don't force them to do something they don't intend to do.

I have no desire to reinstall the LinkedIn app and thus provide them with the opportunity to 'integrate' with my phone. App Store redirects should ONLY be done with the consent of the user.

My desire to use LinkedIn diminishes with each passing experience with their systems.",1
2013-05-31 11:21:10,I like the new UI,"I am a business user and find the app really powerful. My main features are connecting with clients and prospecting, and LinkedIn does this well. The news feature is good also. I like getting alerts when a new contact is inviting me to connect and seeing when someone has viewed my profile enables me to better identify prospects. The new navigation does this well. There is some delay between reading a message and having it reflect on the app.",4
2015-09-17 15:10:44,Doesn't work with iOS 9 on iPad,"Unfortunately this is LinkedIns worst applications across their product line. The iPhone app is great, as is their desktop website. But the iPad version is just badly designed from a UX/UI perspective and as of yesterday's iOS 9 release, the app doesn't even load any information and seems to be frozen. It reminds me of eBays first application 4 years ago, and since then eBay has had 3 major design overalls for the better. It's time for LinkedIn to stop ignoring this application. I know LinkedIn can make a better product than this and hopefully they'll hear us asking for a product that can deliver a great experience.",1
2015-05-23 01:03:23,Crashes & openness,"1) Commenting on a post is difficult because the space provided is small and it doesn't scroll properly if a comment is a little longer. After trying multiple times to make a comment and review it, the app crashed out!

2) Make it easier to open articles in Chrome and other browsers. I hate using the app to read articles because you are trying to restrict me to residing in your app. It doesn't work that well and it is obvious that you are trying to prevent sharing/browsing through other means rather than thinking about the UX.",2
2015-05-12 04:00:13,More than a let down,"This app lacks critical functions like abilities to manage contacts, edit and remove posts- which I find are frequently incorrect outside of my attempts. Sharing a post is not as simple as hitting share. The app introduced new levels of possible mistakes. Want to stalk a coworker go right ahead the app tells everyone who you are viewing you've creeper their page. How's that for privacy. Let's say your job hunting and you view a potential employers profile, like magic now everyone in your current management with the app will see this on their news feed. Thank you awkward. Seriously misconceved. 1 star is generous.",1
2015-01-31 17:53:33,Gotta love LinkedIn,"OMG! I just love LinkedIn. I have met so many great companies and have done quite a lot of business just by dropping an email and introducing myself and let them know my skills and that if they ever need any future projects that could use my expertise that I am always available 24/7. It's just that simple. And I always follow up with a quick email reminder. It works every time.

2013-12-10 20:25:36,The WORST,"This app is terrible.  When I logged in the the upgraded version is went through the whole scam to try to get me to recruit new members for them.  There was a button that said ""invite all contacts"" that appeared to be illuminated and I tried to unselect by tapping on it and it instead invited every person in my address book.  Like, including people that gmail saved because we were on the same email chain a couple of times or contacts I am not in touch with.  I am seriously irked with LinkedIn right now.  I wish they weren't always trying to trick me into do doing their job of recruiting members... This was certainly a sneaky way to do it!",1
2013-10-04 18:13:57,A Great App for Travelers!,"We recently retired, and are doing a lot of traveling; an upcoming trip will take us around the country.  We like this app because, no matter where we are, we can easily get a handle on what the weather is likely to be at our next destination.  Further, we have found it to be relatively accurate, especially for today and the next few days.  A great app - we highly recommend it!",5
2013-07-07 19:56:29,Hit or miss on every platform,"I'm a new LinkedIn user. With this in mind, my concern is every platform I've tried - browser, this iPhone app, and the iPad app, all have different issues. The iPhone app is more responsive than the iPad one, but some features (e.g. Connecting to someone who is not a 2nd/3rd degree connection already) don't work the same as on other platforms. Also notifications don't seem to be working for me on iPhone the same as on iPad. Altogether not bad, but nothing like the polish of some other first party social media apps, like Twitter.",3
2009-04-10 15:02:54,Nice upgrade from the beta,"The LinkedIn iPhone application is a useful way to update your status, list your contacts and invite others to Linked in. The interface is simple but powerful. You can view updates on the folks within your network. Searching is easy and includes; keyword, name, company and title. The queries are saved to a list for easy access later. Easy to use and useful. A worthwhile download.",4
2013-02-17 20:40:51,Constantly Improving,"While there are quite a few improvements that could be made, for me LinkedIn has been the most progressive social/work medium App. I am very interested in the knowing what industry specialist are sharing. I also appreciate the move towards effective organization of peer knowledge with daily updates and group highlights. The better groups seem to work like virtual guilds, inviting while not intrusive.",5
2012-03-08 13:18:23,Perfect for LinkedIn on the go,"I am a rather active LinkedIn user & I love this app! The UI is clever and easy to use. The app works perfectly for me (no errors or crashes) & unlike some other reviewers, I've never considered updating my profile from my phone- so I don't feel like it is missing anything. 

Thanks for a great app! 
P.S. thanks for keeping CardMunch alive also. I use that app every week also.",5
2017-04-07 09:41:08,Recent Updates Improves UX,"The mobile app is now my primary way of accessing LinkedIn. The recent updates and segmentation of job search and other features have streamlined the experience. It's easier to navigate, and keep updated on your network. One problem, if you toggle out of the app when you return it sends you back to your feed. As twitter does now, you should be able to toggle back and return to where you left off.",4
2016-04-25 17:40:17,Getting to fb usability soon,"I love keeping work and private life separate, this does that.  
The apps notifications seem off sometimes reporting even after viewed, clicked responded.
Separations do not seem logical and receiving invitations but not being able to message the person what it is regarding is annoying, but I am sure they will be fixed in time.  All in all a good app, on the iphone much better than through safari for most things",4
2016-08-18 13:56:54,LinkedIn is great!,"The app is efficient, effective and offers comprehensive information. The data is readily attained. The utility of the app is excellent. User friendly. Social networking on a professional platform. I would lIke for LinkedIn to monitor more the content. Some shared information is inappropriate. Lewd. This is not a dating website. As such, activity to influence 'meeting' on LinkedIn is not conducive to the average professional seeking to interact with like minded professionals.",5
2016-07-21 04:19:32,Opportunities for growth and new job opportunities.,"I have been on Linkin for a couple years now and after losing my job, I never would have thought the app would be essential in helping me find my next opportunity, but that is exactly what happened.

2016-04-27 12:51:13,"Perfect App, should lower prices on premium accounts","There's just not another app like LinkedIn, so professional, so different, so amazing. Best app if you're looking for professional advice and tips. It's the right place to look for info about companies and career jobs.

2015-06-14 06:35:08,Love the mobile app & mobile notifications!,"This is the only app I allow to update my phone. A great way to reach out to professionals in your career field, and network.

Some people get lucky with job searches, but networking and keeping in touch on a professional platform is where LinkedIn and the app have really helped me!",5
2016-01-14 16:02:30,New connections post it view is bad,"I use this all the time for work & business and connections however with this new view especially new connection requests is hard to find because the Post-it's are mixed up with ""say congratulations"" so you don't know if you're eliminating someone who wants to make a connection or someone who LinkedIn wants you to congratulate  for being in a new job for 47 years

This new update simply tried to do too much there's so many new additions that it almost makes you want to shut it down and go to another program like a Rolodex",2
2015-10-15 05:40:30,Mediocre at best - 2.5 stars,"Search in the mobile app is very limited. The app overall is a mediocre effort and could be so much better. Looking people up, finding contact info etc. are table stakes but oh so badly executed in the app. Get the basics right. Too bad LinkedIn doesn't have a serious competitor or we'd be seeing a much better product. Now they even started restricting the number of searches you can perform to upsell you to their paid product. Oh wait, even with the $30 a month my searches are restricted. Ripe for disruption. Can't wait for someone to provide an alternative here.",2
2015-08-30 22:36:31,Chief Cook and Bottle Washer,"I find Linked In both helpful and presuming far too much regarding my privacy. 

The management at LinkedIn that approved these apps are absolute jerks.  They make assumptions that  are clearly good for LinkedIn but make the app frustrating to use unless you go along with their theft of personal information. 

The management at LinkedIn get away with this theft because they a *great idea for networking* and they were first to market. The good news is that another app will come along soon that respects people's privacy and works just as well for networking.  I'm already looking forward to jettisoning LinkedIn from my networking toolkit. 

The fact that I had to enter a title in order to submit this review is a perfect example of what is wrong with LinkedIn.  Fortunately, their software is too stupid to recognize a junk title, so I still maintain that privacy.",3
2015-03-10 16:48:01,Bugs and too restrictive,"LI is a good business networking Social Media but has issues too: - quirky bugs, - iPad users cannot publish pieces directly and must use other means, - very slow Customer Service Responses, - very slow Tech Support, - expensive plans that are not as easily understood. We want to upgrade but cannot get questions answered. 
I would give 5 stars if they loosen up quirky restrictions. Its all about networking yet they put you through much too meet and connect.",4
2011-08-18 02:23:05,Better,"Like the new UI. But why can't I add some people to my network from the app? When I go to add the same person from the web page it doesn't require me to know the email address. For some people it works, I assume they allow there email address to be used or have it published while others don't, and all thats ok, but the web page let's me send a message within the LinkedIn network not using an outside email, let the app do this too please.",4
2014-11-16 01:56:12,Invaluable Tool for Professionals,"LinkedIn has become progressively more instrumental in providing strong connections within my work life. I am quite pleased by the recommendation system, as it allows those who can vouch for your professional skills to voluntarily provide credibility to my resume. 

The app is simply the icing on an already delicious cake. Those who need on the go professional networking should download this app right now.",5
2014-11-04 19:13:37,Just enough,"The IOS version of LinkedIn provides just enough messaging and notification to do what I need (communicating with potential employers and ex-coworkers). Given a choice I would use their very polished browser interface on my laptop, but often that isn't immediately possible.  The app has gotten steadily better over time so I look forward to what they do with it in the future.",5
2014-09-07 16:10:13,Missing a lot,"With an app like this you should almost never have to go back to the linkdin website and yet i find over and over missing capabilities like just being able to edit you profile, add skills, or remove connections. Now i have to fiddle with the app for 5 minutes trying to find some obfuscated way to do these kind of things and then finally give up and go to the main site. How is that helpful? Divert your attention from making it look pretty to making it functional.",3
2013-05-14 13:37:39,Apple- please improve:,"The app itself works great, but apple should synch the links received via email on phone, to give option of open directly on app vs safari.  every time I get an email from one of my groups and try to click the link to read it, it takes me to safari and asks for user id and password. It should either (a) take me directly to app instead of safari or (b) give me the option of opening in app when the link goes to safari. This makes me use the app much, much less. 
Thanks!",3

Numerous instances of deleting messages, only to have them reappear (if you can even get them to delete in the first place).  App frequently shows the indicator for a number of notifications, but when you open it, there are no notifications evident.  When you do find notifications, you look through them, but frequently can't get the app to recognize that you have already looked at them so have to put up with the stale circled number showing up on the app icon.

2011-11-20 18:17:23,Can't edit your profile?,The app functions nicely but things move at a very fast rate these days making it imperative that you make it so you can edit your LinkedIn profile on the go. I'll give it 3 stars for functionality but I don't always want to sit down at a computer to edit things. My career is centered around doing 3d art on computers for long hours. When I'm not working I'd like to be on the go doing things and I like to edit my profiles and check my updates for all of my online accounts elsewhere.,3
2017-07-13 17:57:07,"Very user friendly, just needs translation feature.",I use the LinkedIn app almost daily and I live how user friendly it is and how LinkedIn keeps improving the user experience.  The one thing I wish it did have us a language translation feature.  I have global connections and often cannot read posts from my foreign colleagues if they post in their native language.  I would definitely rate it a 5 if the app had this capability.,4
2010-08-17 11:26:14,Unable to view recommendations!,"As much as I enjoy using this App to browse my contacts, the complete inability to review the recommendations of potential candidates (or even write them) makes the app almost worthless for any useful tasks.

This wouldn't be so frustrating if I was able to navigate the main site from my iPhone without having to deal with a ""human verification"" checkpoint every hour of inactivity.

Hopefully an update or two will make this program valuable again.",3
2010-01-12 22:54:37,Have we got their attention yet about the problem with this app?,"I'm okay with the app though I like Facebook's much better. What I'm not okay with is that the latest update dumps out most of the time, making it essentially worthless until they fix this. What I'm not okay with is that they don't have the courtesy to acknowledge the problem in their description above by saying they're working on a fix. Bottom Line: Don't bother downloading this until they say in the above description that they released a stable fix to the problem. 1 star until they acknowledge the problem and fix it.",1

2016-04-08 12:55:07,Still good... Was great!,I am a loyal LinkedIn fan. My use of the app has evolved over time as my professional needs have evolved. I have been pleased with how the app has grown and kept pace with improvements that have enhanced my experience with each update. Recent updates have not met the high expectations I have for an app that has a monthly subscription for certain benefits that are no longer easily discernible from basic features and some that that are difficult to access. Updates need to be revisited.,3
2015-12-24 07:51:37,Ruined!,"The one-star reviewers are right. LinkedIn is ruined! Wondered why I had to re-login after the most recent update. Finally did as my ""messages"" counter was creeping up. WTH happened? No messages. My profile and pic are gone. I thought my connections were gone. Finally found them and was relieved for a second, until I watched all of them (except one) disappear before my eyes! Thought I was losing my mind until I arrived at the reviews. Thank you users! I am with you...will delete this app from my phone shortly. The saddest part is, seeing the positive five-star reviews and imagining the LI employees who were bullied into writing them. Pathetic.",1
2015-12-13 18:00:35,I do not like this redesign!,"Ever have the feeling that someone ""just doesn't get you"", or that realization that you are not the ""target customer"" for a previously preferred brand?  That describes how this new LinkedIn app makes me feel.  It prioritizes stuff I just don't care about -- like notifying me it's the birthday of a former colleague, then forcing me to interact with it to clear the notification. Yuck! Meanwhile, I can't find things I used to check daily. The whole UX is a tremendous downgrade -- sorry, I'm sure you worked hard on it, but what was clear is now confusing, and worse, its off-putting.  I wish I could go back to the old LinkedIn app. I feel sad.",1

Try it, you will love it.",5
2012-11-19 15:03:20,Lacks Key Functionality,"This app lacks many of the key functions you would expect to be present on a larger, more robust device.  Simplistic in nature, the user can search through connections, browse profiles, request connections, and that's about it.

In my mind, especially on the iPad, the user should be ale to edit their profile, browse through their clubs and organizations, and have functionality more resembling the website.

If all you want is to view profiles, then this app will work perfectly for you. If you want more, you should just get on a computer.",2
2012-10-31 21:01:43,It,"I like the interface on the iPad but i can't find how to see my sent messages and sent/accepted invitations. Seems like fairly basic functionality. I also think it's strange that for now, you can edit your profie only on the iPhone part of the app; the iPad with its larger screen real estate would seem to be the easier implementation. Like some other reviewers, would love to have the Jobs and Companies you follow feature enabled on the iPad.

Also, one bug: I can't swipe up fully on the screen in landscape mode.",3

That the app world and the browser world at least wave to each other as they go to serve the information requested.
This app is not that.

It is a cultivated, classy, representative of the LinkedIn brand. It is another part of the whole; making it easier to get the LinkedIn universe into my hands and the hands of all the professionals who need to make it part of their everyday. 

This is the best kind of app: one that takes the purpose and intention of the original site and content, and makes it available, more accessible, and the exact right size!",5
2016-11-01 19:53:06,UX could be improved,"My main complaint with the app and the service in general is a user experience one. Almost every time I open the app, I'm interrupted and prompted to walk through the series of start screens that want me connect with more people, add my phone number, follow content, etc. As a user, I feel interrupted and overridden by practices that do more to help LinkedIn than to help me. LinkedIn is a promising resource for job hunting and managing professional contacts, but I find its relentless attempts to remain relevant to be intrusive.",3
2016-10-05 10:49:20,Upgrade is too expensive,"This is a good app and I enjoy checking it out once in a while. I'd love to upgrade the app and give the company a little bit of funds and receive some of the upgrade benefits,  but the ""premium"" version is over priced .  A jump from FREE to $60 a month is ridiculous. I'm surprised the company didn't go with a $10 a month instead, I would have been happy to pay that. Most companies do not pay for their employees to have this app so it's out of pocket for the average joe and I just don't utilize it enough to warrant spending $60 every month for it.",2
2016-08-23 02:04:41,Excellent Professional Networking App,"If you want to connect, share, message, prospect and expand your network, LinkedIn Professional Networking app has to be at the top of your list.

Now if only I can make my network of connections to listen and act to more of what I have to say 😀",4
2016-01-19 04:22:41,buggy notification,"Overall the app is okay although I really don't like the weirdly awkward new update where the notifications pile up and you swipe through them. 

Biggest issue (why I'm writing the review) is because for weeks I've been getting the notification of 1 new mail/message, but when I open messages and refresh there's nothing new. Every day, 2-3 times, 1 new mail/message, but there's nothing new there. It's obnoxious.",4

But now, as there's no job search in Linkedin app, i will not spend that much anymore. On the other hand, when i check jobs on Linkedin Jobs, i can see the recruiters but i cannot add them to my contacts list. This is ridiculous. I was doing all things at one application, but doing them in two now.

The new update removed all of the useful data presentation about your network, your views, who is interested in you, and other information pertinent to networking and job searching. 

This is now just a very spammed up app that seems strangely parallel to Facebook that has lost 90% of the function of the desktop website and seems to frequently want to add more contacts to the LinkedIn network. I miss the old functionality.",2

Loss of supposedly unneeded functionality?! Brilliant! Kudos to the hipster UI team for taking what was a decent app and completely killing it with this useless and worthless update.

2) who viewed me?....well, every time I click to see who has viewed me, nothing appears. Is that supposed to even work? 
3) clunky...slow. Buggy...etc!

Too soon to tell if any functionality has been added or lost. Seems that a few things are now missing, or effectively hidden under a ""new"" way of doing things.

My advice to the LinkedIn developers is to take small steps, and avoid long leaps. The new interface, despite some interesting features is almost completely foreign to the last, and leaves the dedicated user in a foreign place which may be an uncomfortable one.",2
2012-12-29 19:27:43,Use the non mobile website,"This app seems like a work in progress. Terribly buggy. Definitely build your profile from a computer because there are better options and customizable tags where as the app is very limited in forms, tags, and stability. Ok for browsing jobs and searching for connections but I suspect that the indexing is poor and would also be better online. All I can see this app is useful for is keeping up on the notifications but LinkedIn uses and abuses the automailer function so I doubt this will tell you anything your email hasn't already.

2013-07-15 03:45:47,Like it,"Several major issues I had with previous versions have been fixed in this version. Only one remains: opening links on the app is usually painful, HTML rendering sometimes takes forever. The app should have a ""Reader"" option enabled by default.

It makes you jump through a bunch of hoops before you can get to your home page, and even then it pushes you to install more LinkedIn apps and provide more information.  I feel like I'm being interrogated and then forced to try to find things in the flipping tiles and crap that is Windows 8.  If they keep shoving crap down my throat and providing worse and even worse interfaces, I'll have to close my account.

2015-12-24 22:00:27,Failure,"This has probably become one of the worse apps EVER!  That, on top of the fact you can no longer filter the postings (so you have to page through all the inane postings before seeing what the people you are actually linked to are doing) makes LinkedIn, unfortunately, one step away from being deleted from my iPad and out of my life.  I used to like LinkedIn because it was NOT one of those stupid social media sites/apps, but now they've given in to social pressure and money, so that it's nothing more than a Facebook/blog site for professionals.

2014-02-19 17:20:48,Useless app,"When you receive emails from linkedin groups, clicking a link doesn't go to the app directly. It goes to a web browser and asks you to login to view content. That negates the point of having the app. Secondly, when you click 'connect' with someone, it doesn't let you edit the message. It sends the default message which makes me look like an idiot, especially if the connection is just an acquaintance. Finally, I have never heard of anyone who got hired through linkedin making it an useless app by all definitions.",2
2013-08-02 15:36:44,Pretty but limited.,Overall the app is sleek and has a great look and feel. However there is limited functionality (like managing endorsements) on the app vs. the webpage and I think this is a flaw. One should have as much profile editing capability on the app as on the site (maybe sans deleting your account). I also agree that it's annoying when I follow a notification link from an email it takes me to the iPhone browser and not the app itself. Would give this 4/5 with improvements.,3
2013-01-10 11:08:47,not worth the space on my iPhone,"I use LinkedIn regularly, but am deleting the iPhone app & only accessing it from a PC until they get a better App Developer.  News stories show up as a thumbnail on one screen, but when you navigate to read the article, they're gone.   Email messages, contacts & other communication tools don't refresh or won't reopen a second time.  No way to update profile, find new connections, or to use the tool socially.  This is a prime example of a company taking a web application & thinking it will work on a smartphone - without considering the varied use-case of a mobile user!",1
2012-09-03 16:25:40,Almost does it all,"I like the app, it works more fluidly than the computer version, however there are a couple of features that I wish it had- or made more prominent if I'm blind and just not seeing them. The first feature is the ability to customize your connection request, personal notes are so much better than the general ""I'd like to add you to my network."" The second feature that is missing is the ability to recommend someone. Other than that, I like the app.",3
2012-08-22 16:15:47,"Love it, but what happened to the Calendar","I generally love this app, but all of a sudden, it stopped showing my calendar in the Updates section. I have toggled the calendar on/off, refreshed, logged out and in, closed the app and restarted and even uninstalled the app and reinstalled. It also has access to Locations. It's driving me insane.

Also, please allow the ability to edit profile, pic, etc. and have the profile appear as it appears on e web page- for example, I moved my summary below my experience section but it still shows summary first in the iPad app.",2

Please try again later."" At what point is it going to be fixed? I keep waiting, but nothing has happened yet. Meanwhile, I look rude, because it's been over a week and I haven't responded to this message yet. Please fix the messaging feature soon. The site is great, but the whole point of having an app is for immediate access to the site; if that doesn't work, the app is pointless.",2
2017-03-30 22:26:59,Excellent,"First off it's very rare to run into any bugs, I'm still a college student so I have practically no job experience, so my options are very limited, but if you have job experience I highly recommend this app. I've been at my current part-time job for nearly a year and I applied on linked in, every now and than they'll have some practical part-time jobs.",5

Some of the burger menu items don't load. Example; The Pulse fails or just lands on a blank page, no content. Hoping all the updates might include a fix for this soon!

2016-11-02 00:28:10,I love this app for so many reasons,"I have used the LinkedIn app for years now. I feel very connected and up to date on the movers and shakers.  It's a great way to learn about new products, make new connections, reconnect with someone you met at a conference and much more.  I enjoy reading the publishings and interacting with subject matter experts, I potentially otherwise wouldn't have had the opportunity to do so.",5
2015-07-16 10:20:19,Ok but......,"Really this is a great app. The problems I have encountered would be going and looking at a notification such as a request to connect or message. Once viewed and I leave the app then return later they still appear as not viewed. The situation is resolved if I log into a PC and look at them, but sometimes when traveling that is not an option. Again not a critical flaw, just more annoying than anything.",4
2016-09-19 01:28:01,A fantastic resource for networking and careers,Linkedin is the premier source for professional networking and career search. The information available on the site is spot on as an aid in the pursuit of the next opportunity. The career listing is detail filled and in many instances you have the ability to apply with your linkedin profile.  I really am unable to say all the positives that is linkedin.,5

I have never been more frustrated with LI then I have these past few months with what you've touted as a big deal mobile app upgrade.  It's become unintuitive and impossible to find info easily and quickly.  It seems to be the case from mobile to the web site overall.  I'm not feeling the connections, I'm seeing updates which are not relevant and push info I do not need.  I'm considering dumping my $80/mo subscription now.  Big step backwards.",2
2015-10-07 19:39:43,Needs some work,I love LinkedIn and the opportunities it provides a young professional to connect to other professionals in my field. I do find that when looking at posts I am unable to open in browser or use other sharing options. When I press the share button my only option is to cancel. This may be a small glitch in the grand scheme of things but it disrupts my ability to read content from other like minded professionals and receive feedback. Please fix.,3
2015-07-13 14:32:31,Great but there's room for improvement,"I love LinkedIn. I use it every day and it's become an indispensable tool to connect with other professionals in my field. The only complaint I have is that work samples are not viewable from this app, only from the desktop version. So many people just use the app and and as a result miss out on viewing quality work samples from potential candidates. I hope this gets fixed sometime in the near future.",4
2015-03-06 08:38:00,Fixable Annoyance,"Please fix the new connection bug. Whenever someone accepts my invitation to connect, I get a notification. When I view my notifications, and press on their name, I expect some kind of option to view their profile. But instead I get a page asking me if I want to find more connections. At that point I have to go searching for them in the search bar which is annoying!

Please fix this. Otherwise the app is swell!",4
2014-04-14 13:52:45,Needs better email integration,"I use this app quite a bit. It's the best for professional networking. The biggest improvement I would suggest, however, is better integrating the app with the email newsletters. When I click on a link from one of my groups, it should take me directly to that in the app instead of taking me to the ""home page"" of LinkedIn and then having to manually navigate to the group or article.",4
2014-07-22 21:45:59,Somewhat functional. Changes need to be made.,"I want to say at the start that I am a fan of LinkedIn and its role in enabling professionals to connect and communicate. This app as it stands, needs a simple, but serious improvement. 

When I was viewing a person's profile and pressed the ""connect"" button, the generic invitation message was sent instead of allowing me to customize the message as I would expect. This reflects poorly on my part, because someone who uses LinkedIn regularly would instantly know the difference and be more likely to ignore a generic invitation.

I truly hope the developers read this review because connecting through custom messages is a basic functionality feature all LinkedIn applications should have. 

I will have to just use the website, because this app lost some of my confidence.",3

2013-01-08 04:28:32,Great resource and reference,"Provides a great way to take a quick look at profiles, search for people the moment you think of them, or catch up an various bits of tech/professional news. As long as you're not looking for it to replace the amount detail given to the website, I think this is a good tool. It should be easier to identify/add people through the search function though (level off connection, invitation).",4
2013-10-01 06:37:29,Lack of functionality,"I'm typically happy with the apps I use, but I had to write a review to point out how horribly designed this app is. LinkedIn service is great, but this app cuts it off at the knees and ruins the entire experience. Just opening it to read and delete a LinkedIn message is cumbersome, confusing, and annoying. There's a serious lack of optimization to the iPad screen size (iPhone version is ok, not great). But the worst is how little you can do in the app, almost everything (including basic settings changes) requires a full browser. There's just so much potential for this app, it's depressing to see it go to waste!",1

2013-02-19 05:37:36,LinkedIn iPad App needs work,"There are few social media apps where I find myself quickly befuddled as to how to find what I'm looking for - whether a posting, update, or invitation.  This has been my experience with the LinkedIn app.  I'm a fairly patient person, willing to page through ephemera to find what it is that I'm looking for, but on more than one occasion, I find myself signing out of LinkedIn until I'm at a desktop or on my iPhone rather than attempt to navigate via my iPad.  It's really a mess, particularly when it comes to trying to find particular contact updates that aren't among the very latest postings.",1
2011-08-16 13:08:54,It all comes to the surface!,"What an amazing rewrite and update! So much more usable and accessible. Fantastic improvement to the interface (especially enjoyed the brief intro). All the various features and functions are no longer buried. Thank you!

My only suggestion (unless I missed something) is that we have the ability to edit our profiles within the app, and to able to attach photos within the written updates. 

Great job.",4
2012-09-14 16:02:38,Counterproductive,"Yesterday I attended a LinkedIn training workshop sponsored by my local chamber of commerce.  The instruction was great, the discussion were lively, and I left the workshop feeling very confident in my ability to use this program.
Unfortunately,  I tried to use LinkedIn on my iPad, the layout and format  were so different from what I learned in the workshop I struggled with it for at least two hours and finally gave up.  
LinkedIn, please make up your mind.  Are you making a tool that can be used by professionals easily and efficiently or are you trying to meet some other agenda?",2
2012-07-31 11:43:32,Very disappointed,"When attempting to access a link to either comment on a discussion board or review a job, the app hangs. Even though I have the app installed on my iPhone 4s it continually asked me if I want to download it again. I have also encountered many issues with now trying to access the non-mobile version after installing the mobile version. 
True to other comments you can not update your profile with this app.  In my opinion, the creators of the app need to re-look at how the end-user may need to use the app.  Tech support has not been of any help either.  I would NOT recommend this app!",1
2012-07-28 05:07:22,So-so,"I very much want to give this app an excellent review. It has a beautiful, intuitive interface – far superior, for example, to Facebook's. However, this app crashes much too often. For example: whenever I'm reading comments in a group, and try to hit the back button, without fail – crash!

I can also find no way to manage my group as administrator, which is frustrating...

Still, fix the bugs, add that one missing feature :-) – and it becomes a four or even a five-star app…",3
2012-05-24 22:44:54,"Good Interface, Functionality Needs Improvement","As far as the interface of the app goes, it's a very clean interface that is simple to navigate. The biggest thing lacking from the app is the ability to edit anything. The website is clustered and difficult to use, but it's the only way to update anything.

Otherwise than that, I'm on LinkedIn everyday. Thank you",4
2016-10-14 17:49:48,Searching for Contacts by Location Needed,I really like the recents redesigns and upgrades you have made to the app but one problem I keep finding is that I don't have a way on how to find my contacts within my network by location thru mobile app and allow me to create a temporary list to message. This is critical for those who travel and want to leverage their network the most by being in another city.,4
2015-05-05 16:10:10,Most efficient networking app,I've been impressed with the options this app has available for free and premium users.

I don't care if my other contacts like it or forward it, once I've seen something one time and made a decision on what to do with it, I never want to see it again. I spend 90% of my time on Linked In deleting the same stuff over and over. 8-10 times a day for weeks and weeks. You need to stop the madness. One delete and please let me never see it again.",2

2015-01-01 17:25:11,Very Disappointed,"I downloaded this app to help me stay connected on my phone. Unfortunately, immediately after downloading this app I discovered it had also installed malware. Every time I opened a page in Safari, it immediately directed me to the App Store to download Kim Kardashian's app instead of opening my desired website. After I uninstalled this, I could visit any site in Safari. Heads up LinkedIn- don't include a virus or malware in your programs. I was very disappointed that such a seemingly reputable company would include this in their app- knowingly or not, LinkedIn, you should test things like this before you release anything.",1
2014-06-26 20:59:38,LinkedIn Ipad apps are beta versions... at best,"A few major flaws:
1)  Cannot edit profile on my nice big Ipad screen/keyboard but can on my tiny little Iphone? Are you kidding?
2) The jobs app works like an alpha version (how it got beyond beta testing in it's current state is beyond me!) and it almost worthless. Page displays are not scaled correctly making it impossible to do anything with job postings that show up on the ipad.

In my opinion, LinkedIn would be better off not releasing some of these apps until they are truly ready to be used in a meaningful way.",2
2014-04-29 04:00:54,Linked In,"App had been improving greatly in the last two releases.  However, I just found out LinkedIn will start to support photo sharing. Welcome to the new Facebook. Pathetic. What else isn't fixed. 

Lack of Andriod or iOS integration when clicking on or following external links in emails.  This action opens a browser and asks for login credentials. I would really like for this action to open the app (if installed) on my phone or tablet. Maybe this constitutes a feature request, but this would help earn higher marks from me.

The photo thing just ruins it in any event.",2
2014-03-29 14:00:56,So Sneaky!!  BE CAREFUL!!,"So Sneaky!! BE CAREFUL!!!

At every turn, Linked-In is trying to trick you into allowing them access to your entire address book so they can send then relentless spam to connect with you. 

I know so many people who have been tricked into this and have had their careers or relationships negatively impacted. I've heard of emails to ex-girlfriends/ex-boyfriends, the CEO of their company, former clients, etc. which all appear to be personal invitations to connect. They don't stop - people often receive multiple requests that make it look like you're desperate to connect with them. 

Be very careful when using Linked-In. They cleverly camouflage these address book requests as log-in screens or continuations of log-in screens. Read the fine print before hitting the ""Continue"" button or providing your email address and password as these are often traps for Linked-In to be granted access to download all of your contacts and begin spamming them all!!",1

If you try to edit your summary, the current text isn't copied into the text edit field, so unless you write out your entire summary again along with the changes, whatever you do type in there will overwrite what's there. And to make it worse, you can't even select and copy the current text to paste it in the field to edit. So that feature is pretty much useless.",3

I have no recollection of signing up for this yet I am baraged with emails.  When I hit the unsubscribe link it requires me to sign in to unsubscribe.  It accepts my email and password but then requires me to match a text picture to continue.  I match it every time yet it says it does not match.  Please make the bad men stop.  All I want you to do linkedIn is go the f!&k away!!!!  Why are you immune from the requirement to have a simple unsubscribe.  Now I have gone from simply wanting to unsubscribe from emails to having a personal vendetta against your company!!!,1
2015-12-06 18:56:20,New update,"Initially I thought, the new version is bad. As I continue to use it, it is better particularly the home news feed.

I like LinkedIn, but the app is absolutely terrible. So many features are trying to load when the app first starts (including a heinously annoying popup promo box about their new contacts feature) that it often crashes before it can fully start up. 

The process of checking the inbox is hindered by the interface. I have several clicks and screen reloads before I can return to the new messages list, and it's confusing how the lines are blurring between a connection request and an actual message.

Either the chief developer is incompetent, or someone above that position who doesn't know diddly about UI is forcing the process on the development team and screwing up the results.",3

Weird? Yes but they should be exposed.

Loving LinkedIn very much!!",5
2016-04-15 19:09:12,Love the new version !!,"I never used LinkedIn before because their Ux was not very great. I use to struggle my way around the app and website. This new app changed my vision ! I use it all the time now.

2015-06-26 02:02:13,LinkedIn Web Services are Terrible,"As an FYI to all the non-geeks, the reasons that you need to wait 45-90 seconds to complete most actions in the LinkedIn iOS app are due to their own systems (their API's and Web Services). An application / service that depends as much on mobile usage should ideally invest in bolstering their mobile functionality, but my assumption is that their budgets aren't prioritized in that way. Desktop, NOT mobile web, works ok, but anything that has .m or .mobile is virtually non-functional. 

I could be catty and say that they're prioritizing advertising tech over core user functionality, but that seems obvious. :-)",1
2015-05-28 13:14:34,LinkedIn is awesome-app still not so much,"It would be great if the app was linked to the update emails linkedin sends out. On my pc if I get an update email I click the link and it takes me there. On the app when I click the email link it takes me to the linked in login screen and then into my profile. I don't expect full functionality in an app- they're really just for checking updates and such. But taking care of this would get 5 stars.
Overall the app is good for checking status, but not really useful as a professional tool.",2
2015-04-10 20:57:30,App needs to fix bugs,"I thoroughly enjoy using LinkedIn, but the app needs some serious bug fixes. The badge notifications always show one higher than the number of notifications I have when I open the app, notifications are slow to go away once you've viewed the info, and I've sent more than one message from the iOS app that never made it to the recipient. Trying to follow a message thread on mobile or online is a feat. They really need to fix messaging.",3
2014-12-07 02:41:28,"Too Clumsy, Kinda Frusturating","LinkedIN has a number of things that annoy me. First off, if you use it to post a job opening, the only way you can look at those jobs is from the profile that your company is linked to... So other employees cannot see the people's resumes without getting on your LinkedIn profile.

If someone connects to you, you have to view their profile in order to make the notification disappear. 

Overall the experience could be better.",3

2014-12-03 22:01:47,Need simplification,Although I find this app very useful sometimes I think it lacks of simplicity. I believe categories forms of communication and menu items are somewhat on organized and sometimes difficult to navigate within this application although it is still useful and I think that there are some tweaks that would help such as easy navigation from the original LinkedIn app to the job LinkedIn app.,4
2013-02-02 04:56:00,Not ready for prime time,"Lots of problems with mobile version. App is installed but if you get an e mail for an invite etc and select it, it goes to a screen that asks if you want to download the already installed app. If you say No Thanks it launches the Linked In website but just goes into and endless loop of a turning gear. Not by any means intuitive, you need to guess where thing are, shows a number of notifications when you have none and the list goes on. Either badly programmed or badly tested or both. In need of a major overhaul to have value.",2
2012-06-18 10:31:28,Does what it describes but that's it,"From this app, you can view your profile, your connections, non-connections, messages, and groups. This part is done very well and very user friendly. However, one of the main functions I'd use the app for is to update and edit my profile, which cannot be done from the app.  It crashes a lot and when I really get to clicking around the links and news feed I'm greeted with a ""something went wrong"" message at which point I have to manually close down, end, and restart the application.",2
2012-01-28 18:24:31,Horrible email integration on iPhone,"You need to fix it so that when you click on an article on your iPhone emailed to you from LinkedIn it detects the app and interacts with it instead of safari and it keeps asking you to install the app! 
When it takes you to Safari it's super buggy and it doesn't let you even log in. The keyboard disappears almost immediately each time you try to type a single character. Grrrrrrrr so FRUSTRATING! :(",3
2017-05-24 22:17:05,Premium required to send a message??,"There are quite a few features that are obstructed by not purchasing the (expensive) premium membership that's overly advertised and I've accepted those nuances, however requiring premium membership to SEND A MESSAGE is absolutely ridiculous for a professional networking site. I understand some of the extra features requiring premium membership, but sending a message to ANYONE, whether you are connected or not, should remain free. I can't wait until you get some competition.",2
2017-03-22 00:38:21,Top Social Network These Days,"Years ago Facebook took over for MySpace as the more sophisticated social network but now that it's all spam videos and people endlessly complaining those of us looking for interesting topics, thoughtful ideas, and professional conversations can engage with each other on LinkedIn.  A breath of fresh air and a continuous tool for productive learning.",5
2017-03-03 16:29:46,Terrible Look for iPad,"I like the idea of the platform for professional sharing and connecting, but it looks and feels terrible on my iPad. I prefer to use LinkedIn on my iPad where I can easily read and digest articles and put thought into comments and writings. It looks good on my phone, but I don't like to use LinkedIn on my phone. As one of the largest social platforms out there that obviously actually has a business plan and income, it is really disappointing that the developers cannot build an app that works and looks great on both iPad and iPhone.",2
2016-03-03 06:17:47,Everything & more,"I can stay up to date with every contact re: their updates and send congrats, birthday wishes, and anniversaries the day of their status being updated. This app gives me notifications that prove I am able to remain in constant contact that keeps me close to each important contact I have worked so hard to make and maintain.",5
2015-09-10 08:37:25,Horrible for updating,"It's been at least three years since I logged into LinkedIn and I'm trying to update my profile. I own an iPad and I went to the LinkedIn site and it will not let me edit.  So I came to the app store to download the LinkedIn app. Even worse. If there are editing options then it's not very intuitive. I've searched all over the app and I don't see a way to edit my profile.  I'm pretty computer savvy so this is ridiculous that it should be so much trouble to update the company I work for, at this point I'm just going to delete my linked in account altogether if I can even do that.",1
2015-06-20 14:37:40,Professional Networking,"This app is a powerful for keeping track of Professional contacts in every industry world wide.  Quickly connect, communicate, and update with individual members, or organizations, at the touch of a button while on the go.  This is definitely a must have app for any professional wanting to network.  Very user friendly, stable app.",5
2015-04-08 12:53:07,A bit clunky,"I like using linked in on Safari better because it seems more responsive. I get many mails from linked in so when I follow a link from a mail, I sometimes go to the app while other times I go to the website. I enjoy the website more because of the speed, but I think both need improvement. 

The app can be a bit confusing at times. There are a few features that the app cannot control while you can do it through safari.",3
2015-03-08 21:42:12,Megster,"I loved LinkedIn now. Their app has improved over the past couple of years. I was not impressed with it when I first downloaded the app.  However, now I used it more and more now to be in the know in my field. Also like the fact that it does list the people who work where you work too. I gave it a 3 star because people are able to see my resume, but I still haven't been able to directly find a job on here. There's still room for improvements.",3
2014-07-03 15:55:23,LinkedIn is an excellent networking tool,"I have been using LinkedIn for years and find it to be an excellent networking tool for professionals. It helps me find former colleagues and new prospects. I have even been offered jobs through various recruiters. On another note, I am always amazed by some reviews. Why would someone harshly rate and publicly criticize a  business based on trivial matters? Can't sign on!  Really!",5
2011-09-11 18:57:18,These people who complain either have a different app or don't know how to use it?,The best app I have on my phone-I can do everything I see other people complain they can't do. Just be curious and try touching different parts of your screen to see what might come up because you can do almost everything you have available from your computer.,5
2013-12-26 19:37:10,Lacking,"Mainly, it lacks a lot of features from the website, but it's also broken.  I'm here to vent after receiving a job message.  I had written about 2 paragraphs when all of a sudden some ad type thing asking me questions popped on the screen.  I had to repeatedly press ""skip"" to get rid of it.  When it was gone so was the response I wrote.  I tried to recover it, but even worse, I somehow managed to delete the message to me so and now I can't recover that to even respond again!  What a pain.  Also it's really annoying that messages between the website and the app show up as RE: Re: RE: Re: RE:",1
2013-04-19 00:51:10,Meh,"Have used the updated LinkedIn app now for a day or so. I have used the LinkedIn web tool heavily for years and the app frequently since it came out. So I feel I have a good base of experience with the tools to judge them. Frankly, not impressed with the updated app. In my opinion minimal updates could have been done on the prior version and I'd have given 5 stars. The new version seems busy with too much going on within some screens. 

Maybe the next version will earn a better rating.",3
2012-01-31 15:46:14,Cant update your profile?  Really?,"The app is good for browsing contacts, and it's fast. However not being able to update your profile is a bit inconvenient for me as I am in sales and hardly ever at my regular computer. Also it says I have 2 notifications and I can't seem to find them. It is very limited on what you can do with it. My app on my old blackberry worked better then the one on my brand new iPhone 4s which is really irritating. Hopefully there will be an update soon.",2
2017-08-12 22:15:30,Gotta love those hamburgers!!,"I have the S-model Tesla now and my wife is on the reservation list for the Model-3.  We are still as excited today as when we added her name to the long list over a year ago. Using the hamburger analogy, the burgers keep getting better and the first served will have all the trimmings - just tell them if you want ketchup or mustard.  They all have the special sauce.",5
2016-09-09 10:42:47,Best App,"I have been a part of LinkedIn for a better part of five years. His app has helped to me keep up to date with information not easily accessible in the mainstream media. I have been able to connect with other professionals, both from the military and private sector. I also use the LinkedIn Jobs and Group apps. It is nice to see folks taking care of us.

Very Respectfully,
G.G.",5
2017-07-24 05:05:58,Closes randomly very often,For some reason this app just closes even after phone reboot and app reboot this is especially annoying when applying through app for a job or in the middle of messaging a prospective employer I figured for a app with a platform this enormous a bug like this would not be prevalent especially running on a brand new iPhone but seems to be a very bad defect of the app forcing me to give 1 star would give less if possible for the lack of effort by the apps producer to maintain the working status of such a widely used application thumbs down to the makers and the team assigned to maintain app,1
2015-12-08 01:29:22,"Big update, getting better","Huge update and I think I like it so far, but it's still not as robust as the web version. It's getting there!
I use LinkedIn Tags but they aren't anywhere to be found in the app. Tagging should be simple; open the connection and in the options, include 'tag' function. Or, have a 'select' function to select multiple connections, and then a 'tag multiple' function.",4
2016-08-18 03:10:00,Must have app,"LinkedIn is sooooo helpful and literally the best thing to have. Whether you're trying to start your career, as I am, or a professional with hard in the business, LinkedIn is a must have. The app is super easy to use and it guides you along the way. It also provides you with so many opportunities to learn and grow. This app is helping me so much and I'm so grateful for it!",5
2016-04-18 01:53:12,App is now stuck on a linked article,"I apparently made a mistake when clicking on an article a colleague sent me to read via message. Once the link opened, I got stuck on it. There's no navigation bar, back button, or anyway to get out of the circle. I tried linking through to the sender's profile and searching for my own profile, thinking I could eventually get back to the homepage that way. No luck, and a search for Homepage only returns businesses named Homepage or something like it. I guess I'll be using LinkedIn a lot less now.",2
2013-10-15 18:59:26,LinkedIn - IPad / iPhone,"I am a pretty dedicated LinkedIn member. I really enjoy the platform in general. I use my iPhone almost exclusively for ""endorsement management"". The iPad for reading LinkedIn content. For facilitating my group I use my desktop computer & MacBook Air. It would be nice if LinkedIn could develop one interface that worked across all platforms consistently - not very likely from a realistic and pragmatic perspective. I do appreciate that they appear to be trying!",4
2015-12-03 13:02:32,Update Disappointing,"When I went to open the app this morning on my iPad, I could not believe it was not formatted for a tablet.  The User Interface is extremely broken and far from user friendly.  The old format was PERFECT.  It was easy to navigate and all the options were laid out at the top of the page.  Account settings - I cannot even find those now and the menu segregates all the information.  I deleted it. It  is horrible and as part of an app development team, I am floored you released this.  If you change the web version, you will lose me all together.",1
2015-04-29 12:52:50,From somewhat adequate to maximum uselessness.,The LinkedIn app has always been iffy at best. Even simple things were unavailable or ridiculously difficult to find. Recently they added a fantastic new layer of annoyance and frustration.  It's a social mobile app. It's primary purpose is to allow me to quickly check the status of my network. Instead I get a 5 page request to plug LinkedIn in to every single aspect of my digital life every time I open the app. Today I got hit with it a second time in one session.  That's how you get your app deleted.,2
2014-12-05 04:18:32,Just right...,"I had heard of LinkedIn for quite some time before I began using it. I find it to be an excellent way to connect with colleagues as well as meeting new people in your field, or in my case fields.

I've received many new business opportunities and have grown my network substantially. I really enjoy the app and am very excited that I finally came to see what it was all about!",5
2014-06-05 00:28:05,"Connected, for a fee.","Generally a good service.  I've found it useful, but I think they need to quit hounding me for premium membership.  Yet another platform to have to keep track of and monitor the content of.  General lay out is good, content seems relevant.  The ""endorsed"" part is a bit of a joke.  People endorse each other on everything in exchange for getting themselves endorsed.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE PREMIUM MEMBERSHIP.",5
2014-03-01 17:12:55,"Finally, I think this app works well","I am one of the original members of linked in from the early 2000s. It is been a frustrating journey, but now this app works quite well. 
I much prefer LinkedIn over Facebook or any other social media apps. 
I like stories of animals and other human interest things, but I much prefer spending my time with things that have significance.",5
2013-04-19 00:16:55,IPhone app not friendly to LI rules,Overall the app is helpful. There are some needed improvements. LinkedIn advocates for invitations to be personalized with a message to potential connections however; the feature is not available on the iPhone app. As a LIR user I was able to show that the declines were all from the iPhone as I use the personalized invite feature religiously via the standard site. Endorsements are annoying and irrelevant.,4
2017-06-29 12:30:57,Works as I would hope,"I really like the phone app for LinkedIn.  I like that I can surf jobs, attach a PDF res or port to a message, message system works well for me too.  There is always room for improvement and I look forward to where this goes.  My only qualms, and it's not a program problem, but it's that users tend to post things I'd expect on Facebook, and not a professional app used to promote you field and profession.",4
2012-09-13 02:44:09,"Limited functionality, far from intelligent","I check email mostly from my mobile device and when I get an email from Linked In, tend to click on it. That takes me to the non-functional mobile Linked In site so I installed this app. Problem is it's implemented very poorly. It not only does not launch automatically when I click on a link in their email, it is not even smart enough to pull up the link I clicked on once I launch the app manually. Linked In engineers will do well to take a look at Quora's app and implement atleast the basic features that make the Quora app so seamless and a joy to use.",1
2017-09-07 16:41:54,Love It,The LinkedIn mobile app makes my life so much easier. I use LinkedIn much more frequently from my phone and I find that the app is not restricting in what it allows you to do vs. what must be done from a computer. I never have any problems or glitches and I appreciate the helpful notifications. Definitely would recommend downloading.,5
2017-09-02 22:01:02,Great Networking tool,This app has allowed me to connect with hundreds of like minded skilled professionals locally as well as nation wide. I was contacted by several recruiters just hours after updating my profile. The updates are well thought out and make using the app better each time. I would have given more than 5 stars had it been possible!!!,5
2017-07-14 12:49:32,Great business tool,"This app helps me to keep up to date on all business related topics that are in the wheel house of my choosing. Dependable interface. Navigation is a breeze.

The only knock I have is that the site is not very intuitive when it comes to finding all the articles I have saved for future reference. This is minor though.",5
2017-03-30 13:36:32,Artist,"LinkedIn seems to be one of those companies that is setting the bar for solid apps. I like the ease of use and the amount of notifications seems just right, not too many like some apps that won't leave you alone. Keep up the good work! LinkedIn remains the best network for successful professionals and those looking for opportunity and achievement.",5
2017-03-16 00:42:26,LinkedIn job spot,I hightly dislike where you put the LinkedIn jobs locations. You replaced it with the profile button and I always click that thinking I go to profile and it opens a new app. I use the LinkedIn job app frequently I don't see the need to switch between the to from the main LinkedIn app. Please go back to the way it was. Thanks!,5
2016-08-18 11:13:30,Satisfied app user,"I really enjoy using this app. I like the level of professionalism that is maintained though we get a few posts that I deem may be for other social networks overall LinkedIn is very professional and networks business minded people together to keep informed on upcoming events, news, history, and ways to get involved in any profession. Keep up the good work:)",5
2016-05-03 22:33:12,Facebook For Professionals,"This app, like the desktop version is a great way to gain and maintain contact with industry professionals whom one might not like to have access to one's drunken political Facebook posts. 

I repeatedly connect with people here whom I don't know personally but who do the same thing that I do, or work in related trades, and I find great value in that.

I have seen numerous peoples' problems commented on by some very smart people, to good effect.

I don't know how good this is for landing a job, but I see that industry headhunters are viewing my profile regularly. That's got to be good, right?

Zero downside to this app.  If you work for a living this is a good social media networking tool to have in your pocket.",5
2016-05-31 09:59:07,Can no longer view Companies I'm following,"Why did you remove the function to view the list of companies followed? This had been available in the app for many, many years. This is an important function for job searches. I used it daily to view new job postings at my target companies and search for contacts there. 
While I can search for each company individually, it is now a more tedious process. 
Also, many posts in the feed are 3+ weeks old and completely outdated. Sorry I updated the app.",2
2016-05-03 03:31:09,Great App with one suggestion,"I love having access from anywhere at anytime. I'm always on it, especially now that I am job hunting. I also have the LinkedIn Jobs app. One improvement I would recommend is to include the premium features that come with the job seeker paid membership (i.e. Salary estimates for job postings, HR contacts for the jobs, etc) on the mobile version in addition to the full desktop version.",4
2016-02-25 11:41:16,Why are features absent in iPad version?,"Overall, the app works well. One of my favorite features available in the iPhone version of the app is the ""how you rank"" functionality. I have yet to discover how to access this in the iPad version, so if it exists, then the UI is not intuitive. I use the app over the website for speed and convenience. Having to dig for the one feature I want to see is counterproductive.",4
2015-12-28 03:35:27,Used to be a good mobile app,"Was a great app on my iPad for some time.  Recent changes have been troublesome.  After re-installing, it now only works in portrait mode.  Definitely a step backwards for mobile apps.  Someone fell asleep at the wheel with the latest version...gave it two stars only because the desktop version has not been ruined (yet).  Hope the mobile app gets fixed sooner than later,",4
2016-01-02 08:22:38,FB Wannabe!,"LinkedIn was a great forum for professional networking but has quickly succumbed to peer pressure, Facebook and other social media. It used to be easy to find job postings, business contacts, and professional papers but now it has become flooded with recipes, personal stories, unrelated humanitarian stories, holiday wishes, and other information overload which plagues other social mediums. It is becoming exceedingly difficult to find what I am looking for. 

LinkedIn has become a victim of users who are apparently more interested in winning popularity contests than establishing and maintaining true professional contacts.",1
2014-08-16 20:11:51,Why I knock it 1 star...,"Only because of what I've read about it not being iPad friendly (I mean, c'mon). But LinkedIn is a great networking tool that allows me to do what I need to do when I'm on the go. As someone who is in sales, I'll say that I've never used it for prospecting efforts or otherwise important career decisions while not on a desktop... Frankly, I don't know of a single social media / networking channel that doesn't have flaws on mobile devices.",4
2015-12-12 02:13:32,Long time user,"If you do not give me an option to return to the previous version of the mobile app, I will delete LinkedIn from my device. It frustrates me.  I am not interested in seeing what you think I want to see, or what you think I need, or what you think I might be interested in, and I do not feel like clicking the ""convenient"" (not) button to unfollow the idiotic stuff that fills my screen.  It is a mobile app, not the end all, be all, you want. If I want to be entertained or waste my time, I will log onto Facebook.  How do I get the previous version back?  The click is ticking!!!! Pitiful!",1
2015-11-14 21:09:59,Simply Put - No!,"Was a great app! Used it every day several times a day, to stay up-to-date on the stories that I wanted to stay up-to-date on. This new version is absolutely terrible! They force-feed you things that they believe you want to be shown. If I wanted that kind of new source, I would just go to any of the hundreds of other News aggregator's that were out there. This one was different and has been my go to source for a while now. Looks like I will have to start my search all over again. Thanks, LinkedIn for ruining a wonderful app and making a very loyal user base ticked off.",1
2015-10-01 07:03:08,Cannot update profile,"This should be a top priority...if u use an iPad for research functionality, unfortunately the LinkedIn app for iPad has disappointed many.  They still have yet to make this available even though it's a very well known problem.  This almost makes this app even more dull as I have not had any luck in establishing a ""work connection"" to a new place of employment through this type of solicitation/networking...user friendliness to those hiring and making a legitimacy in these areas could vastly empower your users...",2
2015-08-22 21:57:26,LinkedIn,"The easiest, most relaxed way to contact, or connect with other professionals in your field & associated fields without the need to have an associate introduce you.

I think this has been a great app. & have used it for many years.",5
2015-04-09 18:48:06,Must Have This App!,If engaged in business this app is a must have. Having the ability to search almost anywhere for any person you may meeting gives great advantages. You understand where you share common background or contacts. These seemingly simple glimpses of a contacts background info will prove invaluable. LinkedIn = Business!,5
2015-03-17 14:08:16,Much better guys,"Much more useful functions. I'm very happy with it. 

One thing that people do wrong on LinkedIn is not interacting and engaging. A quick ""Congrats"" to someone on their work anniversary is a nice gesture. ""Like"" someone's article. They worked hard on it! This app lets me do that on the go and that helps me get more views to my profile, more useful connections and ultimately more business interactions.",5
2015-02-06 16:15:44,iPad app lacks features,"I've found the iPad app to be nearly useless. It lacks an incredible amount of the basic functionality that even the iPhone app has. Of course, for the advanced features of LinkedIn you'll need to be on the computer, but as far as apps go, for some reason the iPhone app is far superior to this iPad version. Essentially all that is available on iPad is viewing other profiles. Can't even do simple things like edit your profile or view sent messages. Desperately needs more functionality.",2
2014-07-13 18:26:11,Great for networking!,"This is a necessary ap for those in the business world. You can connect with people, groups, companies and find jobs. It is very helpful! 
I gave it 4/5 stars because the mobile ap will not let you know if your job application has been viewed, and the website online will. Other than that is is great! 
Highly recommend it to anyone in school, looking for a job, or in business!",4
2014-07-31 14:07:33,Poor update and flawed triggers,"LinkedIn is great and all, but you would think my notifications via email would match my app. Also, half the time I can't make the app badge disappear. The worst problem really is that if I click on a link in my email or anywhere else on my ipad, it opens safari and then begs me to download the app I already have. Can't that open in the app? I've even had it give me that notification while using the in app browser! Sure, the new update looks cool but there are hopefully lots more on their way.",2
2014-01-30 14:33:18,Only one issue for me,"I use LinkedIn all day long and am amazed by how far they have taken their site and service. This app works very well for me, I have no major negative issues. My one feature request is when inviting to connect with someone it would allow you to customize the message. Currently it just sends the invite with the generic LI message which is bad form IMO (I like to add a sentence about how I know that person or such).",4
2014-03-21 16:00:02,5 Stars All The Way,I have to give the app 5 stars! I've had 4 job offers within the past week and being that my comp at home broke I wouldn't have found out about them without the app. The app works just as good as the full site with a few limitations here and there but all-in-all the key sections are still right at your fingertips! Keep it up LinkedIn!,5
2014-02-26 00:15:56,LinkedIn abandons the iPad 1,"Unfortunately, with this version LinkedIn has officially abandoned the iPad 1.  While the latest version was already not available to iPad 1 users due to iOS limitations, those users were still able to use the latest compatible version.  However, with the release of this new version, iPad 1-compatible versions are no longer supported.

This is disappointing, because other apps are still supported, and I'm not going to buy a new iPad just so I can use LinkedIn on it.  I will continue to use LinkedIn on my computer, but it will be less a part of my life.",1
2014-01-05 21:50:59,"Good mobile version, but upload and refresh speed is a little slow","Although its not as streamline as website, neither is it supposed to completely replace the site. For on the go news, updates, notifications and messages it works pretty well.  The refresh speed is on the slow side though, and that's the only thing that's keeping it from being super accessible",4
2014-01-22 14:23:52,Top rated,I'm in the top 98% of viewed profiles.  This app has helped me network at the tip of my fingers.  I received many offers through linked in and now I'm working on my own.  Love linked in and I recommend it to everyone.  1 wish?  Being able to delete people from linked in through the app or delete feature for anything posted incorrectly.  Thanks!,5
2014-01-14 02:01:28,Outstanding method to fine a career or learn about opportunities,I have used this app to help strengthen my knowledge and provide support to interested companies. I really enjoyed having recruiters and company managers be able to view a picture profile and information including see who you are connected to. I welcome anyone to view my profile and thank linkedin for your assistance.,5
2013-01-16 02:13:12,Decent app w serious weaknesses,"While a major improvement over earlier versions, friendly interface and ease of use, the weakness persist from very startup. App integration is faulty and not recognised from email link unless passes thru App Store-this is most frustrating. Think connection sharing and contact details access missed out. Fix those and it's a super app. A Facebook for serious and pure professionals for business related interaction.",4
2017-03-02 07:35:57,Very Handy,"I love using this app and find it very useful. Overall I find it easy to use and to update my information. My only gripe is with LinkedIn's overall general decline in user privacy. I don't like that people can see posts that I like, comment on, etc... it's basically turned into a Facebook. But overall for the purposes of quickly updating my profile, finding a job and playing, it does the job.",4
2011-04-22 19:23:21,No groups!,"Not that useful of an app, as yet. I can see my connections...and that's nice. But I'm constantly reminded of how this app falls short whenever I get a LinkedIn email regarding a group topic I'm following...tap the hyperlink...redirects me to a page that asks me if I want to ""get the LinkedIn"" app (which I already have)...and then no ability to look at your groups with the app. Just not that useful without that or the ability to do advance searches like on the website.",3

I guess they just don't know how to use their phone or the app. Has worked 100% glitch free for me. In some ways it is better than the website. Sleek design everything you need right at your finger tips. You'd be stupid not to get this app.,5
2016-11-01 22:43:40,Really useful,"With the desktop version of LinkedIn, I typically looked at my feed when I wanted to add to or change my profile. But the app does so much more; the feed gives me just enough information that I enjoy a daily check-in. I really appreciate the prompts that serve as a tickler file to send a congratulatory note on work anniversaries, new jobs, and promotions.",5
2016-10-05 09:48:15,Invaluable app for job seekers,"After getting downsized from a large company and finding a very hard time finding a job to support my family of five kids, I turned on LinkedIn and building my profile, connecting with people, and after two long years I've landed a job, a good job that will provide for my family.  Great app!  Thank you very much!!",5
2016-08-03 21:50:01,More than function,"We very seldom hear that something as useful or as under appreciated as an app can be more than functional. The LinkedIn mobile application is just that though. It alerts me when I need to refocus on connections, jobs contact appointments, etc... I love it because it has amalgamated into the everyday part of my professional life.",5
2016-04-22 19:41:13,Awesome app why so negative reviews,"I really love this app and was surprise how many bad reviews, I honestly think there are too many people who just can't move on, tech changes including UI, I feel like the User interface and flow are very well thought out, I am a software architect myself not related with linked in but used this awesome app to find my dream job. Anyways great job guys !",5
2015-08-13 01:28:49,Fantastic Application,LinkedIn is a professional app that makes it easy to connect with other professionals. It helped me form a network with folks that were in my phone but not connected on a professional level. Very easy and useful tool in these days and times when no one stays in the same job through the years.,5
2016-03-22 17:59:43,Giving up on using app & back 2 desktop,"Biggest issue: Cannot InMail from the app since update. Every time I try to InMail someone I get a prompt message ""You already have a subscription..."" Which is clearly irrelevant.

Keeps popping up annoying messeges about installing other LinkedIn apps, which interfere with my work and discourage me from using this app az well.

App Design has become so complicated that nothing is in its intuitive place anymore. I am using this app less and less and doing most of my usage on the desktop version.",2
2016-01-27 19:52:29,Glitches abound,"They still have some work to do on the mobile app. Very annoying to write a post only to find out that 1 it won't load and 2 the draft was not saved. 

ARGH!!!! Don't waste your time trying to write more than a short statement otherwise you may end up totally frustrated. 

Another glitch - when trying to post a share or comment from a web browser to LinkedIn the app does not auto load. So you still need to log in over the web and lose any of the functionality of the app.",2
2015-12-11 17:50:19,Portrait-only orientation adds to pathetic interface,"I *despise* apps that force me to use a portrait orientation.  Don't these developers ever work with an iPad in a case, on their laps or an airline tray table?  Completely unacceptable and totally absurd in today's world. 

Add to that a generally miserable interface with a ""feed"" that force-feeds you what they want you to see instead of the ability to permanently adjust to a ""most recent"" view and other horrifyingly bad UI decisions and this is a misfire at best and a total fail at worst.

It must be nice being the only game in town, LinkedIn. If there was any competition at all I'd jump to it in a heartbeat.",1

2015-03-04 03:04:33,Fine except the hidden profiles,"LinkedIn has its uses, but I still have a bone with them letting people look at profiles anonymously.  I have found stalkers that actually create fake profiles to link with me to get my contacts.  So I finally had to not allow my contacts to be seen.  Why can't LinkedIn take complaints about stalkers and not allow people to view your profile as anonymous.  Sure, the response will be that recruiters or companies interested in you may not want to be seen, but why is that not my choice?",2
2014-12-01 20:53:55,Not as useful as I'd hoped....,"The app shows abreviated version of profiles. This can be useful when you want a very quick preview of someone's professional background while on the road. However, the app is extremely limited. It doesn't allow users to review sent invitations or emails--only received. The search function is weak and there's no advanced search. There's no ipad version which is a bummer. The app doesn't allow responsive graphics from the desktop version. I hope there will be advanced improvements.",2

If you don't have this App your letting yourself down!!,5
2014-06-12 18:41:03,Job descriptions,"Why can't I review a job description after I have already applied? This is really annoying for someone like myself, who wants to review the job requirements after getting a call back for an interview-especially after having applied to multiple job postings. It helps with the interview process, and allows potential employees to remember certain things the employer is looking for in a candidate. It shouldn't be sealed up like it is after you have applied. 
FIX THIS!",3
2013-12-24 19:38:01,What's the point of this app?,"I get weekly job updates to my email.. I click on one and it takes me to the home page of the app instead of the job. I'm browsing online or on Facebook and click on something on LinkedIn and it takes me to the home page if the app. Can't change my profile. Can't effectively search for people.

This app needs to communicate better with the website and other sites or its basically useless unless the only reason you use it is to check your LinkedIn messages.",2
2013-09-03 02:11:42,iPad App not much use for premium acct,"I have a premium light account but the iPad app still only shows five random users who viewed my profile. I have to use Safari to access LinkedIn & deal with the annoying pop up reminding me to get the app even though I have it downloaded. Apple knows this because I go to App Store & my option is to open app. Please LinkedIn improve the interface with iPad so I can use it. If you can get the app to work right on the iPhone certainly you can on the iPad, right? App is useless, can't see sent messages. LinkedIn staff never responds to help area on website either.",1
2010-03-25 01:02:47,"Looks very useful, could be better","Although it still needs a few features (for eample put a new photo on your profile), from what I can see, it has many useful features already, and they work. The ""in person"" feature was very handy just now in adding someone to my contact list.  I might put this on the front page.",4
2012-11-03 14:56:10,So many things need changing,"UPDATE:  This company is ridiculous.  They added profile editing for the iPhone, but not the iPad???  I stand by my original review.  This app is not worth the space it takes up on the iPad.  Don't bother with it.

---------------

1. Needs profile updating
2. Needs a search for companies, not just people
3. Need to be able to join new groups
4. Need to be able to follow companies
5. Needs to present updates in a way that is less visually overwhelming and easier to follow
7. Needs an option to attach links to status updates, so I don't have to email the article to my computer to share it properly
8. The Safari site needs to stop begging me to download an app I already have any time I click on a LinkedIn link.

The app is slightly better on the iPhone than the iPad, but it's not worth downloading to your iPad at all.",2
2012-09-20 11:40:24,No complaints,"I honestly think the app is much better than the site. I'm the type of guy that usually gives the web-site the benefit of the doubt but after a few attempts trying the application I ended ip changing my mind.     

I find myself leaning on the app mostly because the ease of use. I truly like this app and if you use linkedin you would too.",5
2011-11-21 17:05:33,LinkedIn's New Look,"Wow! I opened up the LinkedIn app for the first time in a few weeks on my
iPhone and was amazed at how awesome the new look is! It's sleek an modern, and very well laid out and organized. It's a lot more user friendly because of smoother transitions and more organized clumps of information: you have your News Feed, Profile, Groups, and so much more! Keep up the good work, developers!",5
2011-08-12 15:46:08,Doesn't find new contacts,"This app would be great to have. If it worked properly. Any time you look up people that aren't your contacts already, the app freezes under the ""contact not found"" screen, completely unable to accomplish the only task Linkedin still stands for today: connecting professionals. 

It works do bad some times it doesn't even find the contact you already have. Also I wish there were more filters to look people up, amongst my existing contacts. But those filters don't seem to work on the web version of LinkedIn either, so hey......... 

Wake up?",1
2013-11-17 04:58:38,Could be a little better,"Job search is kinda different it should search for the city you type in and search surrounding cities close by first then work it's way out that would probably be very helpful to those who search for jobs, also if you invited 350 people to LinkedIn the. You didn't read b4 you hit the button I've had to stop myself several times already",4
2016-07-14 03:23:00,Prettier but dumber,"Please bring back profile rankings, alphabetized connections lists, and notifications of connections' new connections.

The interface still needs work - mostly with speed/stability. Too often, loading a list/profile freezes the app for at least a few seconds. The app has also crashed occasionally - for example, after I loaded a certain number of profiles on the People You May Know list.

Finally, profile editing functionality and settings availability are still too limited compared to the desktop site.",1
2016-04-04 00:04:02,Give it a try,"For everyone stressed out from constantly running into fake job sites and the fact that almost all applications are online now, this is a way to streamline the chaos.

Take the time you spend on facebook and apply it here, where you can make your life better.",5
2016-02-25 14:23:41,STILL finding itself,"1. I look forward to the day when it will find an identity and a user interface and simply tweak it to make it better instead of changing everything every time leadership changes its socks.
2. It hasn't quite figured out how to make money. So the layers of service to users come at pretty high prices when they should be free.
3. I don't visit pages of 'friends' and others because Linked In tells the names of visitors. 
4. It is still the biggest name in the space. Worth joining for that reason alone.",2
2016-02-12 12:29:15,Needs to be as smooth Connections,"With the retiring of Connections in less than a month LinkedIn needs to be as smooth and usable as Connections.  Maintaining updated and able to respond to changes and events in ones Network is what makes LinkedIn more than just an online resume. Taking note of a connection's work anniversary, birthday, updates etc. and congratulating them in a smooth user experience is essential to maintaining a healthy network.",3
2015-12-14 02:33:06,Bad UI,"I'm sorry, LinkedIn, but your app has become pretty useless to me. Before it wasn't perfect, but now it's a total pain.

The user interface is hard to use and it's hard to find where the functionalities that I use most are located. Also having to swipe through notifications individually is a chore, especially since I don't care about most of them.

I now only open the app the get rid of the little red number that shows up for unread notifications. Will uninstall if it does not improve or at least revert.",2
2015-06-09 16:42:41,LinkedIn for iPad,"Although the look and feel of the iPad app is better than the iPhone app, it lacks a great deal of detail and power that the LinkedIn website provides. My biggest gripe is that the iPad app does not show the Premium features if you are a Premium user. Even the iPhone app has some basic premium functionality in that arena. Add those features and I'd be a happy customer, however I'll going to stick with the website sticky link on my iPad in the meantime.",3
2015-05-10 18:33:21,Opportunity to not only network but to learn now to.,"I believe people are so caught up with networking and not seeing how to do it correctly.
What LinkedIn provides is to see what other people do and learn from them.
People with great careers are great at networking.
Of course, it's also a chance for you to endorse you friends and coworkers' skill sets too. A great way to appreciate them!",5
2015-02-26 00:38:58,Awesome B2B Must Have!,"I coach and train serious sales and business professionals. I have seen first hand the positive revenue generating impact that LinkedIn has produced. Simply said - if you're in Business to Business - you HAVE to not only be on, but more importantly need to know how to use this tool. 

That said, it would be great if the tablet App would better emulate the laptop/browser version of LinkedIn.",5
2015-01-02 04:41:01,Engineer / Program Manager,"Linked seems to be pretty good for displaying my experience, however it's been over a year that I have been looking for a job & have not received a phone call from a LinkedIn reference. I have been on a few interviews (through a recruiter & a friend) unfortunately, I was either over qualified or not a good fit, but LinkedIn doesn't seem to be the medium by which I've been contacted. I have also submitted my resume to several companies (i.e. Facebook, Tesla, Kaiser, etc.) via LinkedIn & it doesn't appear to be useful.",2
2014-12-28 02:01:14,Good way track down contacts,"I have been a passive user of LinkedIn but have found it very useful to find old colleagues and friends. However their email leaves quite a bit to be appreciated. It is often unclear whether I replied or received something, and when. The endorsements are also clunky, as they have no definition or related background associated. Consequently I have been endorsed for IT skills instead of physical security related skills due to colleagues misunderstanding of meanings.",3
2014-11-21 02:01:48,Logout problems,"The linkedin app has always been one I've used often. However, in the past month or so the app logs me out every day or two. As I keep different passwords for each application, I have to look up the password to use linkedin. Usually I will just skip it instead. I use it about once a week instead of daily as a result. Please fix this so it stays logged in on the iPhone. I would give this 5 stars again with this feature restored. 
Thanks!",3
2014-10-16 11:37:21,LinkedIn doesn’t connect with Safari,"Trying to use LinkedIn App on iPhone 5 and never NEVER connects with Safari—telling me “Sign In Failed — Oops, please check your email address and password.  OK”

Well folks, it’s not OK and it basically doesn’t WORK…..pass on it.

AND ONCE again, version 8.0.2 is the same as 7.1.5 version There is NO connecting to Safari linkedin website with an iPhone6 through this app….when, if ever, will linkedin get it right.  Funny thing is that the iPad version logs me in AND connects with links in email….all these FAIL with iPhone version, no matter WHAT update version they have put out.",1
2014-01-20 20:32:47,Great app - NEEDS one more thing...,"I've been using this app since I made an account on the site. I use it nearly 2-3 times a week and there is something this app still needs. The option to remove connections. Occasionally, I find that a connection I once made no longer benefits me or the relationship has faded and I no longer converse with that person professionally. I would love to remove connections without accessing the desktop site. Easily 5 stars if this happens.",3
2013-10-28 13:37:58,Modification,"I am using iPhone 4s and this app is so great except of one point, when I receive emails from LinkedIn groups, Or when I want to open a link received by email. I wish these links can open immediately in the App instead of Safari browser, I hope that you can add this option to make the App more useful.
Thank you very much",5
2013-10-03 18:12:32,Resourceful App,"There are days when I check LinkedIn as much as Facebook. This app has a nice interface now, and it's particularly useful as a news feed - where I can read industry articles from my network and groups. 

The next step would be for LinkedIn share buttons to penetrate most news outlets, apps, and websites so that I can share my own thought pieces on LinkedIn directly from my mobile phone.",4
2017-08-31 22:34:38,Helps the user to be more knowledgeable,"I feel like LinkedIn helps the user to be more aware of opportunities and career information rather than directly getting employers to notice you. If you want employers to notice you then you have to ""work"" the network. They aren't going to notice you unless you contact them, have a great profile, and reach out to people outside of the app and on the site.",4
2013-07-12 11:52:05,Does everything I need!,"I use linked in daily for recruiting, marketing, job advertising, competitive intel, and researching companies and their staff- not to mention the content. In business articles, groups, etc. FYI - You can learn much by who viewed your profile.  I have no idea why others have rated this app less than 5 stars. It is my most used app beside email.",5
2013-07-10 18:08:47,Entertainer,This is a great APP. I think the negative reviews I read must be from non iPhone users. Not one problem. I have increased my connections from 30 to over 200 in 24 hours and new connections just keep coming. With the APP I was able to invite my whole address book with 2 clicks. 1 for subscribers and 1 for subscribers. And the APP does so much more. I am amazed. Thank you LinkedIn.,5
2013-06-02 00:53:44,Very mediocre,"This app is frustrating and inefficient to use. Falling WAY behind behind other social platforms, LinkedIn's app hardly makes it easy to use. Switching back and forth between messages, notifications, profiles, and posts is silly and takes up too much time. As big as they have come to be, it's kind of disappointing that their app is so mediocre. Professionals use their iPads and iPhones for business all the time so they are really losing out on potential mobile connectivity between users. I'd use it more on the go if it weren't such a pain to navigate and use easily.",1
2013-05-01 02:42:58,What happened?,The previous versions of this app were much better. BIG COMPLAINT is that  in v6.0 for some reason they no longer show you the actual total of your own contacts anymore. Why would they hide that... from you? Thats a very important feature. It also no longer seems to show you the amount of contacts on anyone else's profiles. If these numbers are still there its very hard to find them so it's  bad design either way. Also much less intuitive feed. They neutered what was a decent and highly usable tool. Big step in the wrong direction guys.,1
2013-04-20 03:24:53,Usability Issues,"Amazing how you guys do a ""complete redesign"" but the People You Know feature has the same usability problem as I stated below in my review months ago on the prior design.

Look, a redesign is not defined by changing colors and button shapes.

As the main feature I use this app for, I won't change the 1 star rating until you fix this feature.

Here's a suggestion.  Get rid of the buttons. Instead, use a swipe left to delete the person from the list and a swipe right to invite them.

Also, instead of making us take action on the 99 of 100 people we don't know, provide a mass delete option.

From my first review:

The People You Know page is terrible. The Invite and I don't know buttons are close to each other, you can easily invite someone you don't know. And, there is no way to mass delete so you have manually delete 99 out of 100 in the list. Huge waste of time.",1
2012-12-29 08:06:54,Getting better,"I remember when this app was pretty bad, so maybe my review is skewed. I see LinkedIn as the new (but old) and invaluable networking tool on the scene. I'm glad it has gotten better and hope to see more improvement on the refreshing to erase notifications. Also, it's a little too layered when using it--you have to click more than once on different pages to get to an article that piqued your interest. 

Overall it's getting less clunky! 3 stars!",3
2012-11-15 11:27:52,"Issues, issues, issues ;-(","Loved it when I first downloaded it, but every time I try to connect with someone I get this ridiculous ""oops...something went wrong, try again later"" error message.

2012-09-25 03:19:23,Please fix calendar!!,"This is a great app and the calendar feature was one of the best things I've ever seen developed!  Unfortunately between recent updates and the upgrade to iOS 6, the calendar feature is struggling to pull in accurate profile info. Even profiles for first level connections are only showing up as email addresses rather than pulling the user's profile. It was working fine for a while but only recently have I seen problems with pulling in correct profiles. Please fix and I'll raise rating to 5 stars!!!",2
2012-07-16 23:46:28,"Pretty, but a pain!","New version:  Same problems as before now with new issues.  Seeing jobs in the Jobs section is fine, but now you have to see 50 jobs to find 1 update!  Irritating!

Before:  Try to connect, but it asks for their email addy.  Try to comment in groups, but there's always an error message.  Can't update simple profile items like where I work.  If you do most of it on your computer, I'm sure the app would be fine to just refer to.  Don't do just the app or the air will color with frustration!!!",2
2012-05-15 09:34:12,Really slick and polished app,"I haven't quite used this enough to know if I can do everything that I want with it, but it's looking good so far. It's a very polished app, good-looking and easy to navigate. I generally ignore my update feed when viewed in a browser, but it actually looks interesting here, presented in a magazine-like fashion, and at the risk of sounding narcissistic, I like the way my profile looks.",5
2016-10-26 17:43:00,Great access! But could use a new feature!,"I love the app, but would really appreciate the software developers/engineers designing a LinkedIn publishing app within the main one or a separate one altogether (akin to messenger for fb)

LinkedIn removes the need for business cards. Just ask ""Are you on LinkedIn?"" Then connect with them to continue the conversation later on.

2013-09-21 12:52:15,Great example of what an app shouldn't be...,"This app will consistently disappoint you...  You will receive email updates related to your network, but don't try accessing anything from the email hyperlink...  You will just be informed to install the app, or log-in.  Well, it is installed, and I am logged in...   Then, try to do the most common functions of the full solution...  No, go back to the internet to do that...  What's the point of having the app if you can't easily access it from the email updates, and when you do log in, you can't do anything?  Awesome example of pointless app!",1
2012-04-01 13:59:15,Just a little bit more,"Great app. Pairs really well with their newly acquired CardMunch app for connecting with new people. Obviously, they need an iPad version, but the most annoying thing to me is that my daily digest emails won't open in the app. I just get a screen in safari wondering if I want the app, and a perpetual loading screen if I do. I do want the app though, that's why I got it already. If this coding were fixed, I'd be a happy camper. Thanks guys",4
2013-05-16 13:43:00,Bad app,"I installed this app on my ipad because every time I tried to log in from my email to accept an invitation the app installation page would pop up. However, I never could find out how to accept pending invitations and you really couldn't do anything but view your profile and can't edit it. I just deleted it.  Don't waste your time. This is the first bad review I have ever written about an app.  I really like LinkedIn but hate the app and wouldn't use it if this was the only option...so unless they totally overhaul the app....in the words of Taylor Swift... we are never getting back together, LIKE EVER!",1
2013-05-06 14:54:07,Annoying,"Updated review - new interface is like a bad version of the Facebook newsfeed - if it's even possible to be worse; no menu navigation.  Completely useless.  Will get better functionality using my Etch-A-Sketch.

Old review - 

Why is it that app developers assume that users want their preferences reset or ignored after each update?  While this app works OK, it resets notification preferences to ""ON"" even after I have disabled them.  And these preferences do not reflect preferences set by a user when accessing LinkedIn from a web browser on their computer.  So I am forced to turn them off after each update - and perhaps more often than that.  In addition, this app still does not offer iPad native display resolution - which may not matter anyway, as I am close to deleting this app in any case.

Hopefully LinkedIn will realize that the Facebook model of disregarding user preferences is a bad idea.",1
2013-04-19 00:01:13,April update,"Were is the improvement
The proceeding mobil app was smooth 
The four icon launch or the icon to launch photos and logo of the people i might know , jobs my own groups and companies I'm following all had a crisp easy feel to it. Now everything is all back and fourth side to side up and down.
Ill give it a whirl after all I'm not a premium subscriber.

Maybe the highly skilled developers should implement features on par with the likes of cloudon and dropbox. After all the pc is being replaced mobil. 

Currently my biggest struggles are creating written work such as updated resume and sharing it without the integrity of content being lost in copy and past mode. What i create on my phone needs to read like i visualize it on the mobil screen and linked in could be my go to app.",3
2013-02-03 17:41:42,Poster child for useless big name apps,The linked in app looks more like a college programming class exercise rather than something from a company trying to be the premiere social app for professionals. I use and like LinkedIn on the web; I am even a paying subscriber as LinkedIn truly delivers value to professionals. The linked in app however is simply a view into my account with VERY little other functionality. I would expect a single developer could create the entire app in a college semester (and I am padding the schedule). The app is stable and does not crash; but since it really does not do anything......,1
2012-10-23 01:07:00,"Annoying, not functional","Why they tried to make this look like Flipboard or Zite, I don't know.   They failed at it anyway.  Why do they think I want a completely different experience on my iPad than on my desktop?  Why can't I tap on and expand the Who's Viewed My Profile list without opening an individual's profile?  Very limited profile editing and endorsement managing, too.  Just a poor reflection of desktop LinkedIn.  Also, following a company doesn't work at all, fails every time (not to mention that it always suggests that I follow my employer, whom I have followed for years).",1
2012-07-04 13:08:35,Does not open email in app,"I deleted this app because it's useless, limited, and does not open up LinkedIn emails in the app. 

I get daily LinkedIn emails and when I click on links it opens up safari instead of the app and then it does not even load. So I can't ever open up a linked in email that has links included.  In addition, the app can't do anything on it anyways. It won't let you access over half the stuff, so u have to resort to the computer to get and check stuff.  

I gave it 3 months time and the updates never fixed anything, so I deleted it once and for all.",1
2012-03-06 22:28:44,Love this app!,"I'm happy to stay in touch with all my connections on the go. It's very easy to use and navigate. You out to download it today! Easy to read, reply and create new messages and check out the groups updates. Easy to find people you know and with one touch on your screen send an invite to connect! Yay!",5
2012-02-01 17:01:00,Impressive,"This app is well written. It has ergonomic layout that puts Facebook to  shame. I especially like the Linked In button which collapses the layout into 4 panes that host each of the most common areas of linked in. I was surprised at how fast it was. With it being free, there is nothing to complain about. I am happy I downloaded it.",5
2012-02-21 20:01:33,A pretty good app,"This does a great job of capturing the important parts of the website and it is great or networking. The only things I would change is allow people to edit their profile on smartphones and also when sending an invite to make a connection, make it so the person's name shows in the invitation instead of having to enter it yourself. Make those changes and I'll change my rating to 5 stars.",3
2012-01-04 03:20:09,Flashy - could be more usable,"The last big overhaul changed the interface significantly and not all better. It is pretty but harder to find your way around. 
I don't like the fact that you cannot set preferences for badges and notifications. I understand some want to see them all the time, but I want to be able to switch them off. I'll give it a little longer but if it keeps irritating me I'll delete it.",3
2014-10-09 04:20:36,Quick and improved,This app has improved greatly since the first version. I was just able to send a message to someone very quickly and was able to find them in less than two seconds. I like to be able to zip in and out. I have not tried applying for jobs on it yet but it has most of the features of the website very accessible.,4
2011-02-07 13:46:25,A year later and the experience is just as bad.,"I just downloaded this app. I get email updates for my Linkedin account, but I thought the app would be good to use. I tried using this app a year ago and it was horrible. It crashed all the time, and it would not update reliably. I figured that after a year they would have the bugs worked out.

Nope.

It just crashes after I try to sign in. I have tried resetting my device. Sorry Linkedin. You just lost my support. I will stick to Facebook for networking, because their app works.",1
2017-09-05 13:58:48,Intrusive,"I downloaded this app in order to respond to connection requests without entering login info in a browser. What I got is constant notification badges when nothing is actually happening--even when the app is closed--just to trick the user to engaging with the app. Thing is, I want notifications on connection requests, and you can set preferences to a degree, but every time I turn something off, I get a notification I can't turn off about NOTHING (e.g. There are people I might know in my network...not notification-worthy).",2
2017-08-19 12:21:55,Best Business App to stay Connected!,"I have to admit I am addicted to the LinkedIn APP! Love how easy it is to post pictures, write a blog, and now videos! LinkedIn has increased my business 1,000% by being connected to people around the world. Great place to keep updated on business news, when people are switching companies and providing recommendations. Love LinkedIn!",5
2017-05-10 22:26:46,Great Product,"LinkedIn makes keeping up with your professional network more manageable.  It allows you to stay in touch with your peers professional progress and allows to stay in contact during those key Proffesional milestones (job change, promotion, work anniversary etc...) This is really a priceless tool.  Keep amazing us with new functionalities.",5
2016-01-02 15:48:22,Star deducted for group experience,I'm confident I will be able to bump my rating up to 4 for future versions. I'm a little frustrated that I can't send reminders to connections I invited to a private group. I pretty sure my invite is sitting in the full inbox of my connections unread. It would be helpful to be able to send reminders easily or at least know whether the invite has been viewed. The workaround of reaching out to each connection separately after the first invite is not as streamlined as I would expect from LinkedIn.,2
2015-12-28 17:50:48,Linked in recruiter w/free trial,Total scam. Shocking linked would sink to petty tactics of unscrupulous advertising/marketing companies where they bait you with a free trial an then once they have the money it's very confusing an almost impossible to cancel. It's not what they represent it to be. You end up getting tons of job offers but are not able to recruit anyone. There is nobody to train you how it works or you would have understood how limited it was and canceled during the free trial. They make even trying to cancel super difficult. Basically once they got your initial trial payment your toast. DONT DO IT.  Total waste of money.,1
2015-12-27 04:32:19,Garbage App,"Arrogance and ignorance are the 2 factors controlling software developers. Arrogance because they never listen and believe that they actually can boss users and ignore comments and requirements. LinkedIn thinks of itself as an industry leader that delivers mandates. Wake up LinkedIn !!! You're not.
Ignorance; those developers need to learn that simple is sophisticated and classy. You can't disable copying in the software on a mobile platform because simply I will dump it and use PC. Imagine an ugly software make you drop the mobile platform and such is actually dropping the site itself.

LinkedIn needs a wake up call",1
2015-12-15 07:32:26,Not even worth 1 star,"I'm not sure what LinkedIn had in mind when making this update but they need to go back to their old design. When I am notified of a new connection or something else, I have no idea where to go or what I am looking at. Instead I am forced to see contact updates like someone's birthday or a new job that is irrelevant to what I was actually interested in. The interface is no longer user friendly or useful. In order to be a successful networking platform you should give users the ability to do just that with your app. Please update asap.",1
2015-08-11 19:08:56,Social media for colleagues,"Great way to keep up with colleagues moving around your industry. 
Not the best place to advertise. Watch out for over connected head hunters and expect lots of third world strangers to request your acquaintance. 
Multi-company and multi-national projects are fun to document and link all the players together to make sure everyone gets credit for their work. 
Most people don't check their accounts very often, so expect some inMail to go months without reply.",3
2015-08-01 06:18:04,"Beyond my first time, thank you!","This app is handy, but every time I go to run the app, it always insists every time that I go through it's wizard for finding contacts and such like it's my first time opening the app.  It's incredibly annoying and, worse, it wastes time.  I don't need to watch her on how to find more context by email or whatever when all I want to do is accept an invitation, for example.

This little annoyance is why this app is getting three stars and not five.",3
2015-07-29 16:43:17,"Love the app, but missing important functionality!","Love LinkedIn, but I would like to have the ability to do more things found on the website through my mobile app.

For instance, when you search someone on the computer, you can see your common connections by clicking the drop down arrow before accessing their page.  On mobile you can't do that.

I'd also like the ability to refine searches on mobile to the degree you can on the website.

Lastly, for some reason I can't see any of my sent mail on the mobile app.  Is this just me or do you really not show it?  I'd like to be able to see whole conversations with people. I think that is really important! What if I forgot what I said to them or if I even responded?  Please include these updates! Thanks!",3
2015-05-21 13:57:51,"Poorly designed, frustrating to use","The entire app is a bit of a mess with poor UX and cluttered design. Notifications don't always work correctly (keeping badges even when you've tried to mark alerts as read), navigating is tedious, and the signal to noise ratio is just bad. The app also periodically forces you to go through the introduction screens all over again. Then interrupts what you're doing (if you're able to do anything) with pop ups asking for ratings.

So here's my rating: 2 stars. Very poor experience.",2
2014-11-21 19:44:49,Great app,"I used to think LinkedIn was pointless, but they've added so much functionality that it's indispensable now. Groups and InMail are my most-used features on the mobile app. I also recommend the Premium service, $50/month seems steep until you realize the added functionality is actually quite useful.",5
2014-01-27 16:30:55,"Great Site, Good App","I'm 89% pleased with the app. There are moments when I get stuck in the web ux after clicking a link in my mobile inbox, there are moments when I can't find any reference within the app to activity for which I received email notification, e.g. 'Congrats on your work anniversary!' Other than that, like the concept and the site, I love it and I find it's my go-to place for all things career-network-job related.",4
2014-04-14 18:46:58,Mediocre interface tool,"Feel like my data is being siphoned and it's hard to see where you can manage your data vs what interface views. Went through some data breaches and the pay-for version not really a cut above. The pay for version is just a less stringent view of what you have now. That helps no one. LinkedIn is far behind in making sense of the collaborative benefit interface and until this gain, as The Sharks would say, I'm out.",3
2013-11-07 20:35:18,Great functionality though rough around edges,"Generally provides similar functionality to the desktop website, though minor issues need to be addressed. At times, when the main site / back end is under load, the app claims internet connectivity is lacking.
Also placement of 'like' button makes it too easy to inadvertently click on it while scrolling.",4
2013-09-07 16:26:46,Great app!,"This is the kind of help we all need to stay in touch with the industry, key groups, and trend setters right there, on the go...
You can take advantage of most of the features provided on the Web version however the space restriction of the mobile platforms give an inevitable sense of ""tightness"" that can be easily understand by the user. Great app, very useful and always updated with the latest information.",4
2013-09-28 03:13:46,No ability to include message when connecting,"Need to be able to include a personal message when trying to connect to someone. When you click on the plus sign to connect the app immediately sends a request to the other individual instead if allowing you to include a personal message. 
Another feature that should be included is the ability to reorder the groups on your your initial menu settings.",3
2013-05-31 01:24:25,Good with room for improvement,"Overall, a good app that keeps me up to date with professional connections. The interface has changed a lot in the past 6 months, but is still easy enough to navigate. Email notifications do need to be more in sync with app activity though. I check messages and notifications through the app daily, but most email notifications through the site come a few days later.",3
2016-05-04 15:39:32,Why LinkedIn became my new Facebook and my favorite app,"I had a LinkedIn account for a 2 years but recently I started checking the app on a daily base and every time I login into the app I catches my interest. Reading about different companies or hints on how to land a job, resume and cover letter advises it all benefited me. Now I'm on LinkedIn more then I'm on Facebook, snapchat or even Instagram. LinkedIn is the Facebook of careers like I say to my friends.",4
2013-01-17 16:48:18,Very limited functionality.,"Just upgraded because the old app showed the options to search for not just people, but jobs, companies, etc., but wouldn't allow me to select any of the options other than People. I thought perhaps this would be fixed in the new version. Wrong! Can only search for people in the new app, the other options are nowhere to be found. Worse, they've removed the ability to edit the profile, which the old app version allowed. 

Who thought that removing functionality in successive versions was a good idea?",1
2012-02-02 10:53:48,"Good and Solid data, Gentlemen and Ladies!","The LinkedIn Forums have been a surprisingly consistent source of revelatory datums for all sectors for which I have had the privilege and time to read.  LinkedIn's methods for community selection and aggregation of information communities and market sets allows a level of openness among tßrusted professionals along all reasonable  parameters, cross-axial analyses.  Good show, All.",5
2010-01-26 04:46:33,Absurd,"After reading so many reviews saying the same thing it simply amazes me that a solid brand like LinkedIn would allow its developers to turn out such an obvious problem. To not be able to invite other LinkedIn members into your network, when that's the while point of LinkedIn, is just a head scratcher. I mean seriously, why? I just wonder how long the management will allow their good name to get slaughtered in the shadow of sheer annoyance. Please, for the love of God, fix your app. With confirmation that someone got fired over this I'll revise to 5 stars. Cheers for now.",1
2009-12-30 14:16:23,Very nice upgrade,"This version has the infomation and interactivity I expect in a mobile version of an application. Good work.

Thank you kindly. Canna-Envy",5
2016-08-03 17:16:57,Love the app,"Much better than using on a computer, although using from a computer has some different and additionally beneficial tools/features. The app allows better instant management features where the computer features seem to be designed for more management. Definitely love and use both!!",5
2013-04-02 13:49:36,Good App,Just only negative thing is it needs an update to allow to send a connect request directly to the people already on linked in instead of having to send an email outside the network. Other than that and also it needing the ability to apply directly to the positions companies post on it or at least a link to apply for the positions on the companies websites.,4
2016-04-27 10:47:07,Helps me stay connected!,The app works great! I can do pretty much everything from my phone where as before I had to long into LinkedIn from my laptop to answer things and I wouldn't find the things I saw on my phone. I wish the email notification would open in the app automatically. That would be perfect!,5

2013-05-09 12:15:19,Is this supposed to do anything?,"First time I've ever taken the time to rate an app. I am a LinkedIn lover and have used the site almost since the beginning. How does a brand synonymous with professionalism produce the most unprofessional series of mobile apps anywhere?

Prior versions were poor, like the most recent which never displayed search results. But this update tops all by not actually showing ANYTHING on my device. Yes, my device is fine and I know how to use it.

LinkedIn, please either knock this into shape or stop trying and focus on mobile optimization of the site itself.",1
2013-04-19 13:29:35,LinkedIn App Review,"While LinkedIn is one of the most amazing networking websites ever!... This app is a let down... There are many bugs & most of the time you can't read the messages or even the comments people make on your discussions. In addition, if you are trying to write someone a decent email, you better go to your computer because this app will error out!

LinkedIn I love you... But your app needs some work- Big Time!

P.S. this is my first & probably last app review ever. That's how frustrating the bugs in the app are. Good luck!",2
2012-11-27 14:44:49,Good app,"Not sure what all the whining is about in the prior reviews??? I've used this app for a couple of years now & it has gotten progressively better with each update. Yes, it has crashed a couple of times. Yes, it has had some bugs following a few of the updates, and Yes it has a few limitations in comparison to the web version. Not quite a 5 star app, But overall the benefits out-weigh the few annoyances.",4
2013-01-03 15:49:02,Astoundingly Bad,"While earlier versions of this app were quite good, the last several updates have all crashed upon trying to execute any functions. It's shocking to me that it would take many months to try and fix this problem that it sounds like almost everyone experiences. I don't generally write bad reviews based on a temporary bug, but this is ridiculous. Each of the latest updates allegedly fixed the problem, but they did not. What is wrong with these developers' QA process?

I have reverted to using web version. I really wish they would fix this.",1
2012-04-21 23:48:36,iPhone app on the iPad?,"I really wish this was designed for the iPad. It seems like you could get a lot more function into it with a true iPad app. Yes you can blow up the screen this version and on the new iPad it looks fine but it's annoying that there is more space that isn't effectively used. The iPhone app has to function a certain way because of size, the iPad doesn't have to function that same way.",3
2012-08-16 14:42:55,Needs to be better,"* Profile -- why can't I edit this or change my picture?
* Jobs -- iPhone only, no iPad functionality?  I would have thought that would be the other way around. Still, I see no reason why it's missing on either. 
* Inbox -- this should be Messages, not just inbox.  I should be able to see every folder I have, in and out. 

This is a great start but there needs to be a lot more functionality here. This app is stripped-down to the point where it's just barely useful.",2

A seriously flawed concept and half-assed execution. Wannabe Flipboard? Not even close. Don't bother downloading these cheesy app. D'Oh!

Lots of the content, resources, etc. you have here would lend themselves to a larger view. I can see using iPhone version for quick updates, etc., but for deeper networking use, and maximizing the toolset you provide, the iPad is where it is at. I for one would use this much more if Universal- this looks like garbage on the iPad currently. Thanks so much- great product- just need some Universal support!",2
2017-09-02 22:51:25,Great business tool!,"I see LinkedIn with huge potential for becoming the cloud solution for everything business.  Networking, sales follow up tracking, goal setting and as collaboration tool.  Like the only tools anyone is using someday.  But I am not sure LinkedIn sees this vision.  If they do they have to hire more creative developers who can design outside of the current paradigm.  The app is clunky still.  But much faster.",4
2011-08-11 11:59:28,Deleted from my iPad,"Yet another app that I downloaded and then deleted from my iPad. This provides value on my iPhone in making it quick and easy to accept invitations, view contacts, send emails to contacts, etc.

But without a universal binary, this app is worthless on my iPad, which I use every day for business. Shameful for LinkedIn. Cutting-edge company? No.

This makes you look like a two-bit player in a very competitive field. You just IPO'd for heaven's sake. You need to focus on end-use of your service by the constituency that you cater to.",2

It tells me to add them, then says they're invited and tells me to add people via email. I complete all these and then nothing happens. I repeat the process and it's as if I had never done it before. I don't know where to find out who is in my network, and I've spent a lot of time trying to figure it out. It's also too similar to Facebook. I don't like how this app isn't it's own. This app isn't useful at all.",1
2015-12-18 20:19:30,UNsatisfactory,"I find the new interface significantly more difficult to navigate for the things I am looking for, and the news-streams much less suited to what I was looking for in previous versions. AND - I have to echo these other commenters - the inability to view this app in landscape mode on an iPad is really irritating. 

I found the old UI much more functional. 

DISAPPOINTING",5
2015-12-18 02:50:00,New UI is extremely inconvenient,"All the functionality of the previous version split up into 7 different apps, for your convenience. 

You want to look up jobs? Download the jobs app. Want to check out some new groups to follow? Download the groups app. Get your daily business news by downloading the pulse app and easily find your coworkers by downloading the Lookup app. Seriously, I thought Facebook when they added Messenger. LinkedIn takes it to a whole new level. If this is what the best and brightest developers at LinkedIn came up with, then we are all in trouble.",1
2015-07-22 16:50:17,Useful tool to keep in touch with colleagues and friends,I tried using Facebook back in January of this year. It was too ridiculous for me. This is a much better tool to maintain contact with others that is always respectful of everyone's opinions and privacy. The necessary updates always keep things moving smoothly too.,5
2015-02-23 17:26:06,Great for Networking,"All around great for networking. The website on the computer does a lot more than what you are able to do on the phone app though. I prefer to work on the computer for LinkedIn for that reason. However, there is an app for LinkedIn called ""Pulse"" for the purpose of staying connected with updates of your connections. I recommend that as well. Stay connected.",4
2013-04-20 19:07:12,Better since the last few updates,"Previous versions were painful to use as the app would keep shutting itself down or everything time you clicked something to navigate it would ask for my password which was a real distraction. Now I find myself checking updates and searching for contacts daily, keep improving!!",4
2014-09-22 13:00:47,Messages sent stink,This app needs serious help. Poor messaging . If I send a message to someone and want to review what I sent or just look at when or if I sent it to that person there's no trace of it . If you click the mail icon where one would think that would be where you'd find the mail it just shows messages that have been sent to you. Very disappointed in this app and probably why I don't use LinkedIn as much as other social media that have their apps in order. Unlike this one.,2
2014-07-30 03:04:36,Awful update,"The new update, while meant to show more of the profile, makes it cluttered. The new summary section is particularly irritating with only a couple lines showing, while before, visitors' attention was completely on the summary, therefore immediately highlighting what position you're seeking, qualifications, etc. Now it's more work to scroll down through an abbreviation of everything and click ""more about so and so"" to see full profile. The top of the profile is so crowded. Awful update.",2
2014-04-13 15:38:07,Where are my messages??,"Every time I get a new message in the iPhone app a number pops up on the mail icon, but when I go to my messages the new mail won't show up. I have to end up going to my PC and log in to the desktop version to see the email. To top it all off by the time I'm notified of the new mail, it is almost a week old. This is extremely frustrating since the mail I received was in regards to a job application. In both instances I had missed the deadline to reply to the recruiter. 

FAIL!!!",2
2013-02-26 17:54:41,Please simplify the process of adding a connection!,"Overall it's a decent mobile version of LinkedIn. It's responsive and fluid and hasn't crashed on me yet.

Here are my gripes with it: 

1) Inviting someone to connect using this app is ""awkward"" and inefficient. You must know their email address in order to invite them. That, to me, is archaic. Why isn't this process as simple as it is on LinkedIn's website? I don't memorize my contacts' email addresses! Therefore, to invite someone to connect using this app, I have to open the iPhone Contacts app, find the contact, copy their email address then switch back to the LinkedIn app and paste the email address into the ""To"" field.

2) The home screen is funky-looking and cluttered because of the live thumbnail ""cards"". (This gripe is fairly minor)",3
2012-06-02 23:54:47,can't login with CORRECT credentials,"i've noticed a couple of other reviews that mention this same problem. maybe just a bug from the latest version update, but definitely frustrating. unable to login to mobile app, instead given a prompt that i've given the wrong password and/or email. which is peculiar because the same credentials work fine from my desktop browser. and what's really weak about it... there is no option given (from the mobile app) to remedy the supposed incorrect password... just prompted to try again. brilliant.",1
2015-08-20 23:24:36,Indispensable tool for business networking,Sometimes messages get stuck and the flags are not always right up on top. I'm not always happy that they hide data unless you upgrade. But I realize they need to make money too I just wish they had a less expensive option for people who are not in sales or recruiting. Still I find linkedin extremely valuable.,4
2012-05-11 01:35:39,Slow and messy,"Very poor showing. It is slow, half the time doesn't load the page, and it is such a mess. You don't need to post 3 of the first paragraphs in an article that someone posts. Post the title, maybe the first few sentences and then a link to it. You only fit like 4 updates per page. My connections, which total less than 500, post about 100 updates per hour. No way I could possibly get to important ones by scrolling through.

I think it needs a lot of work. Not a good representation for a dot com and social media/professional networking company.",1
2011-09-26 23:12:41,Great UI and Mobile UX,"Someone was definitely paying attention to what mobile users want in a social/business platform. This new version is fast, concise and an app I use all the time now. Before, I would kick off a browser just to avoid using the old app. Thanks for listening to your users. Search feature is considerably better.",5
2010-07-29 04:26:38,Good for what it's worth,"I recently started using Linkedin Mobile for my iPhone and I'm not as impressed with it as I am using my MacBook to use the website. I hope in the next update that there is an overhaul of the interface and design. Also a better search for ""people you may know"" would be much nice. Overall it is great for what it is and hope the next version takes it to the next level.",3
2010-01-15 14:16:23,Poor connectivity,"While I think this app has great potential, I am disappointed by the performance on my IPhone. I'm not sure if it is the volume of contacts I have 500+, or the ATT network, or my IPhone, but I cannot actually open the app. I suspect it is the ATT network, but neverthess it needs to be fixed one way or another or it is an opportunity missed.",5

Thanks to the app I was able to find the position I'm currently in. Thanks LinkedIn I hope you continue to help people.",5
2017-08-03 14:43:01,LinkedIn makes life simple,I really enjoy the LinkedIn App!!  It's so easy to keep up with my colleagues and issues that are important to me. Many times you want to bounce ideas off each other. But the best and most enjoyable thing about LinkedIn is connecting with great people. Thank you LinkedIn for contributing to the success of so many people!!!,5
2016-10-26 12:01:58,Useful but handicapped,"I've used LinkedIn since 2004, so I'm biased in its favor. But as much as I like using LinkedIn, the app always leaves me disappointed. The capabilities it offers are often better to use than in the browser, but there's just so much missing that it's frustrating. Why can't I see an entire profile on the iPad? Why can't I edit or even see my notes about contacts? It makes me wonder if they're having cash flow problems and had to lay off most of the app development team.",2
2016-07-13 21:19:58,Buggy and inconsistent,"1. Alerts not displaying consistently between different LinkedIn clients (iPad vs web browser app). 
2. Inconsistent email notifications.
3. My network gets notifications about skills that ""I added"", while I never added those skills and they don't appear on my profile.
4. Application is lagging big time. When I send response to a recommendation it does not register and does not show anywhere till several minutes later.
5. Not able to edit posts (at least in iPad version), can only delete. So if spelling error is made you are out of luck.
6. Like icon does not work unless you click on comment first (iPad version)
7. Turning into a social platform like Facebook, instead of being professional network platform.",3
2016-06-20 22:13:33,Horrible UI,"I like the idea of the app, but it is poorly executed. Navigating it is nearly impossible, and every time it updates I have to answer 20 questions and swipe a bunch of crap asking me to Connect to a bunch of people I don't know away before I can get back to the main part of the app. It's incredibly annoying. If I could hit one button to say 'no take me to the app' it would be fine, but I have to swipe through so many screens to do it I would rather just delete the app and not deal with it if it can't be bothered to remember what I did last time.",1
2016-06-01 22:39:12,Best investment to date!!!!,I have been able to leverage the small monthly payment to attain friendships and professional connections which other wise would have been impossible. I'm excited to see where they go next...I some awesome ideas..I hope they move in the direction i see in my head...keep it up and thank you...,5
2016-06-01 22:38:08,Too many worthless updates,"Seriously? How many worthless updates can you come out with? Not to mention that these updates are huge! How many times can it be security updates? How about you test them before you put an update out? This LinkedIn app has more updates than ""Microsoft Windows"".",5
2016-05-03 10:20:35,A Great Place to Meet Business Professionals & Grow your network,"I created a LinkedIn profile several years ago however over the past two years I've really engaged the Business Networking Platform to grow my business. Let me just say, ""It's Working out well"". I'm meeting professionals that generate leads to grow my business.
LinkedIn ""Rocks""!",5
2016-04-03 17:08:58,Connected...,"Enjoy the app, not really an expert to these type interfaces so I can't do comparisons. I can rate against my inexperience to operate these. I manage very well with LinkedIn...Simple and user friendly, great response and excellent connection rates. Keep up the great work, every little improvement shows that you don't settle for today when tomorrow waits for no one...",5
2016-02-25 14:47:57,Not professional anymore,"Looks too much like Facebook. The previous version was more professional looking and easier to navigate. This is supposed to be a network for professionals.  For the most part I can care less about who has posted what or who has updated what or what meme has been posted. What is important is my profile, my contacts, my messages and my groups.  Everything else should be in the background.

Speaking of profile it is still not fully editable. What you can do on the website should available in the app.",1
2016-01-22 14:45:42,Bad update,I might have left one other review in the App Store so for me to comment on this app means something. I've been a long time LinkedIn member and user. This most recent update is awful. I no longer can see what is happening in my groups and am at the mercy of news that only pops up on my home page. I think it is crazy that LinkedIn would take such a step backwards. This once was my favorite and most used app. Now I cringe when I want to use it. Please change this or you will likely lose me...,2
2015-12-22 21:10:11,Please reconsider the former design,"I thought that the former interface was nice and useable and had a lot of room to be improved upon, but creating a whole new look with less attractive icons and counterintuitive navigation was a poor choice. I hope this isn't a precursor to the future direction of the web version. Please reconsider and change immediately, this used to be an app I visited everyday but now it's so confusing, unattractive and less people/face focused that it's no longer worth attempting a quick browse. Please keep trying, I love LinkedIn and want to love the app again.",1
2015-12-10 13:27:26,An update too far....,"This is a very disappointing update. As a manager who has mobile development teams this is not a well thought out update from a user's perspective. Capabilities like saved jobs are gone and you are told to use the jobs app which isn't designed for an iPad only iPhone. You can only run the app in portrait mode, I don't use my tablet as a regular habit in portrait mode. I would have preferred a mobile app that got me more of the web capabilities that I have wanted included in the app than this. Looks like I am not the only one the does not like this update.",1
2015-12-09 00:30:48,Trying to be Facebook,"LinkedIn is a unique professional network, however it has slowly morphed into another Facebook like app. I honestly forget now I'm on LinkedIn.  There are followers - not connections. You can't easily see your rankings any longer. I really like some of the business changes like blogging but the mobile experience needs to get back to being more professional. The prediction I have is that the nature of posts will also become more fb like if not careful. That opens the door to a new entrant",2
2015-04-16 21:31:46,Job Machine,"LinkedIn has been a reliable source of business, references, and business marketing for me. This app is a perfect logical extension. Doesn't provide the full site experience and I don't want the full site  experience on my phone. This brings the things I can do and want to do to the IOS platform. No crashing, no spam, no complaints.",5
2013-04-20 14:33:31,Finally a LinkedIn app I will actually use!,"I have never used the LinkedIn app before. It was slow, cumbersome and had a non-intuitive navigation. This version changes all of that. Finally, an app to help me find info about those in my network and accomplish tasks I previously needed a full featured web browser to complete. I only wish that it could be easier to rearrange the shortcuts.",4
2015-04-04 03:21:38,No Issues and got me a job,I haven't really found any quirks in the app but I may not use all of its features. The main thing is what it did for my career. Someone being to able to look at my profile and my experience and find out that it fit an opportunity perfectly - the networking is incredible.,5
2014-08-05 22:34:52,The app is  hard  to  use,"This app is sort of like walking into a cluttered dark room in a strange hotel. I am always bumping into unexpected sharp corners, tripping over shoes on the floor, and feeling around to find the light switch.

Some of us have professional reasons to use LinkedIn on our mobile devices. so we are stuck with this app.

LinkedIn itself, of course, has plenty of shortcomings. I'll give it three stars kind of because I have no choice but to use it.",3
2014-04-12 23:27:46,Excellent on Apple IOS devices,"You guys have knocked it out of the ballpark!  Excellent integration and I about to like it more than the website.    The only thing that is a little hard to find (just to me I'm sure) is where to add a quick status update...  Which did not seem as intuitive.

But overall...   AMAZING! Nicely done and keep up the good work!",5
2014-01-18 23:34:39,Give a five star!!!,I really appreation this program is the best for connection any jobs and friends to helping each other's and so much to tell u too long lists.... U should get add this to ur cellphone or computer right now so u will fall in love with it lol trust me buddy's try to add and open this to read make u understand what it talk abt. Hope to hear from everyone!! Take care !!,5
2013-09-05 17:36:50,Okay for what it does,"Much of the functionality of the full website is missing from the app, such as the ability to edit one's full profile or accept written recommendations. But as a social media connectivity app for sending, reading, and replying to messages and status updates on LinkedIn, it works well enough. Just wish (at least with the iPad app) it didn't leave one needing to access the full site for LinkedIn résumé updates.",3
2013-06-10 13:21:53,It keeps getting better - steady as she goes.,"Lots of new features, smooth interface, reasonable speed... Plenty of room for creativity on all level. LinkedIn continues to outpace the competition setting up one of the finest websites on the planet. The mobile app just extends that success in ways I wouldn't have imagined only a few years ago. Thumbs up!",5
2013-06-08 11:38:17,Great improvement in difficulty of use,"The last few updates have really made this app much less intuitive in navigation.
This looks like adherence to the ill-conceived idea that change, simply for the sake of change is a good thing. 
 I can only conjecture that it was political wrangling in marketing or a political upheaval in the interaction design department that wrought this general reduction of usability.  
I hope it doesn't stay this way.  
Please!   Either revert the UI design or throw the dice again and maybe the next redesign will be better.",2
2012-10-29 03:49:13,Good App But Has Navigation Flaws,"The LinkedIn App has gotten a lot better . However one cannot endorse someone's skills via mobile app, which is not efficient. The other is the lacking editing options. One should have the ability to navigate from mobile mode into full site mode and ""not"" have it automatically cycle back to mobile mode unless the user ""wants"" to.",4
2013-03-06 00:02:22,"Good app, would like it to link to my email",Good app. Gives me what I need for the most part. However when I click a link in my email from my phone it takes me to the website and message tells me that I need to download the app or go to the mobile site. I am not always logged into the mobile site but I am on the app. Is there a way to connect the email link to the app or if you can't add a link on your splash page that gets us to the app?,3
2012-02-05 19:25:05,"Works, sleek",It's like the LinkedIn website but at your fingertips and with a sleek interface. Can't add without knowing other peoples email address? Same thing with the website. No crash yet - browsed through all the sections and everything. All in all a good enough app that I wanted to write a review (rare) to bump up its rating.,5
2012-03-31 22:55:15,"Non-intuitive GUI, complete lack of help, one star too kind","Poorly designed as this app is, the lack of even a brief FAQ/HowTo section acts as a frustration multiplier.  Because of this, you will waste a good 10 minutes before you realize that either a) you can't edit your profile from the app beyond updating your picture or b) the secret of how to update ones profile has been deemed matter of the upmost secrecy and enabled only through some non-conventual method.  Possibly involving a second set of hands or optional external device.   1 star is too generous.",1
2012-02-16 03:44:36,Not great,"This app is good if you like to look at updates and messages but really lame if you want to update your profile, add skills, connect people, or write someone a recommendation. All of those things require the website. Despite having the app, I'm asked all the time to download the app when going from an email sent from the site. Information sent by email seems to no relation to what I can access or do through the app. You'll end up on the site (which is super hard to see on an iPhone) more than in the app.",1
2017-08-25 01:48:34,LinkedIn = Business,"I have been a member of LinkedIn for over 10 years, but until I started using it for networking to attract business I had no idea of its reach. Being a premium member has aloud me to be in front of people I never would have had the opportunity to meet. I highly recommend this app.",5
2017-08-12 22:22:47,Great way to stay connected and informed,This is a rich and resourceful app. This app provides you with a solid platform in which you can network and stay abreast to new and upcoming technologies. You can keep track of companies you may find of interest and be alerted when a potential job openings becomes available.,5
2017-07-15 02:48:52,I simply love the new Linkedin,"I use the app to read about topics of interest, I use it to stay connected with my peers, hear about job opportunities, businesses to get into, franchises, I use it to stay up to date on news about the SBA programs.  I use it to find leads and I use it to promote myself as a SBA packager. It is a great networking and information tool. Thanks Linkedin!",5
2017-03-09 20:45:39,Getting Ahead,"The LinkedIn platform, and app specifically, has enabled me to create a professional profile, which can connect me to endless opportunities and connections to help me get ahead and stay ahead. Being a high school student with an account will help me in a huge way in the future, and I'm grateful for that ability. Thanks LinkedIn!",5
2016-12-08 00:32:59,My favorite social network,I really enjoy using the LinkedIn app as well as LinkedIn sales navigator. They have both been critical and helping me find new clients as well as promoting my business. I also like the fact that the website is very professional and they do not allow content that is not related to business.,5
2017-01-11 02:19:49,Who developed this?,I recently downloaded the app. Almost every time I try to make changes to my profile I'll get an error saying something along the lines of 'could not be completed' in various different wordings. I've tried to change my picture and enter skills many times before giving up and doing it from the site. The messaging works fine but I'm not going to be using LinkedIn as a main source of communication. You should hire a software dev from LinkedIn to improve your app.,2
2016-09-28 13:37:32,Hate messaging.,I'm very upset.  I am writing a long detailed message to someone.  I have to go to other apps like browser to get references/ figure out what I want to say next.  Eventually I come back to the LinkedIn app maybe 5 minutes later and then the LinkedIn app goes to the home tab.  My draft message is all gone and erased.  No way of getting it back.  I would expect going back to the message thread will show what I was typing before.  I've seen this issue a year ago as well. Please fix this hole!,2
2015-07-10 15:12:08,Connect Messages,"The app is great but I am not able to send personal connect messages. I do not like tapping the connect button which sends a generic message. I rather have the option to send a personally message when I tap the connect button. 

If this change can be implemented than it would be great. That is the only change I experienced that needs to happen.",4
2016-05-08 00:10:56,Need option for Recent Updates Feed,This app is lacking I that it needs the option to change your feed to sort by recent updates as you can on the desktop.  Also would like to be able to set this as a permanent option in settings on both the app and desktop site.  With Top Updates I see a lot of the same posts over and over which decreases my user experience in the app.,3
2016-04-28 23:25:16,No Fluff Here...,"I find LinkedIn app for iPhone users fun and easy. I'm especially pleased that the content has been tailored to subscribers individual needs. I can easily navigate through group discussions, view job openings, grow my network, or just get caught up on news. I can zip around the app and ""bite"" only into material that's relevant to me. This takes the cake👍🏼",5
2015-12-28 21:22:44,Not bothering to load app on new phone,"I reviewed this app as soon as the original overhaul updates occurred, and see that no one has bothered to listen to the majority. You destroyed an incredible tool. Someone needs to take charge here and turn this train around. I will not download this app or use linkedin until you fix it and add the ability to see your contacts, contact list. How utterly ridiculous you can't access them, what is the point of connecting now? I am so incredibly frustrated and amazed at the ignorance of this redesign and lack of functionality.",1
2015-12-18 17:19:29,LOL,"Looks like they made absolutely no changes to the app from the 9.0.0 OR 9.0.1 release, they just wanted to hide their thousands of 1-star reviews.

I used to check this app frequently on my mobile, and now? I have deleted it from both my iPad and phone.  Completely useless app - my main complaint, why get rid of the picture block showing connections’ new connections??  Not to mention it’s an absolute eyesore.  You’ve really let me down, linkedin, I hope you can deduce from this onslaught of negative reviews that we want our old app back.  Until then, goodbye.",1
2015-12-09 05:37:51,WORST update ever,"WHAT happened with this app? I would give this zero stars if I could because I can't even open it! And you took away landscape mode? I use my iPad when I travel, you ding dongs, and have a KEYBOARD so that I can quickly write intelligent posts and messages. But that doesn't work in portrait, now does it?! I'm going to delete the app now. Thanks a lot. You've now made it too difficult. Did anyone even beta test?? Guhhh, I'm so annoyed. And I've worked in SaaS for more than 10 years. Unacceptable. Your product manager, scrum master and QA team have some explaining to do.",1
2015-11-12 14:59:02,Only three stars because...,"The app crashes every single time I  click on the ""see who's endorsed you"" area. This has been an ongoing problem since I first downloaded it. After several updates, the developers have had ample opportunities to correct this glitch, but haven't bothered. It's very annoying, to put it mildly, and makes me reluctant to use this app. Fix the problem & I will be a satisfied user. I'll also upgrade my rating.",3
2014-12-02 01:27:19,Rapid Professional Inner Action,"LinkedIn is a powerful tool for rapid inner action with other professionals world-wide. As well there are numerous groups that one can join and participate in discussions of a wide range of topics, or commence a discussion about your chosen topic.

I choose a picture with other people it the photo thinking I would be able to crop it, like all other applications.  After it posted I tried to delete it and that option was not available.

2013-08-01 19:50:52,Integration with email needed,"Love the LinkedIn app - almost better than the website!!  Easy to find people, profiles and my groups.

2014-08-16 19:20:22,Bad usability,"I tried to leave a simple comment in the app. It never once autocorrected or auto completed a word. 

Then, once I looked back over I discovered it didn't capitalize the first word of a sentence or ""i"". Being the only app that I have that doesn't use these features it was awkward.

The rest of the app is just blah and often misleading. What I mean is that at times an icon seems to do one thing but does something else. The ""in"" icon has a badge over it but when I go into it there is a flag. I expect that I will get to the badge items but then I am left with more choices. Odd.",1
2014-06-24 16:37:26,"Becoming less ""professional"" with every upgrade.","Although this is pretty much in a class of its own, This is more of a F***book style app than a place where professionals look for potential clients and or employees, I'm constantly badgered by ""let's get started"" on my profile by trying to connect to my phone contacts and face book friends, I know what people and demographics I'm looking to connect to I don't need another social meeting place.
What's next emoticons?",3
2014-01-13 21:59:33,Poor integration,"I get email notifications from LinkedIn. I tap the link on the email. Inevitably I am taken to a login screen. I already have the LinkedIn app installed on my iPhone. There is an option to open the link in the LinkedIn app, but when I tap that I go to my LinkedIn profile. 
When this happens, I close LinkedIn and go to Facebook

Simple, easy to browse and has the right features. The Endorse feature is the new one i really liked bcos it doesn't require a writeup of the person but still validates their skill.  Hope to see LinkedIn as a interview portal in future.",5
2013-04-03 23:27:29,"Great social networking website, poor app","I love LinkedIn. I'm a recruiter so it's become my favorite sourcing and networking tool. My first and biggest issue with the app is the inability to use LinkedIn recruiter. Make this available and I'd be able to inmail on the go, ensuring I keep my premium account for years to come. Second, the app is slow, crashes, and pretty much useless. I don't understand how their website is so seamless, so easy to use but their app is not. Most days I'd rather pull up the website in safari than use the app.",2
2012-09-24 11:02:23,Great place for Professional Networking,I find LinkedIn a Great place for Professional Networking. I spend little time but it got me so many good people to professionally network with who I had no chance to meet or know. Also this one platform where you can write things in your profile which people in your network can confirm or vouch for.,5
2012-09-01 04:56:31,iPhone app glitch,"When I open my LinkedIn app, it works like a charm. However, if I click on an
Email message from LinkedIn, it will either just leave a spinning Linked In logo indefinitely, or will ask whether I'd like  to download the Linked In app. If I say yes, it tells me the app is already installed; but if I say no, it still refuses to open.  I showed this to the ""geniuses"" at the Apple Store, and they said it was clearly a glitch in the LinkedIn app.  Does anyone else have this problem?",3
2012-05-29 03:26:37,"Good, but needs tweaking!","I've finally taken to LinkedIn and the networking possibilities. It's great for that... However, it needs the ability to type in landscape mode. Typing in portrait mode is tough when typing messages within groups. Also, we should be able to edit our profiles within the app. Suggested connections have been repeating after adding several people. 

Besides that, I'm loving the interaction with people in my industry!",3
2016-06-29 18:05:46,"Good, but could be improved","I like the app and use it often, but I wish I didn't get bombarded with a new connection's posts/likes on my feed immediately after adding them.

Please change this.",4

2011-09-20 13:52:49,OK if you want Superficial,"If you are a superficial LinkedIn user, then this is ok I guess.  The last version gives the user much more functionality.  This feels like app development people did this design and not aggressive users.  Please allow us to download the older version again or put more robust functionality in.

I checked my profile on the app after reading that review and sure enough, there was ALL my contact info including PERSONAL emails and phone numbers that I NEVER voluntarily posted on stupid linkedin.

Now that I've had a chance to use it for a while...meh.  Still limited functionality compared to using LinkedIn through a desktop web browser.  iPad version does NOT like to upload photos for posts, and frequently craps out (""post unsuccessful"").  Overall, it's ok, but most of my activity is still through the desktop web version.",2
2017-06-08 00:39:47,Wouldn't do without it,"The mobile app is great! As a job hunter touching base with recruiters, it makes every free minute an opportunity to check for updates and stay in touch.

2016-12-21 02:12:48,Update to recent review,"When you apply for a job and it asks you to upload a resume, you better hope you are in browser mode because every time you go to a selected cloud storage, it will drop and put you back to LinkedIn. It does not even pick up where left off if you were to click and go back. You have to start over again. It's not worth the effort to apply for a job through LinkedIn. Just find the job on the company website and apply that way until the creators of this app fix this problem.",1

--------------

New update with no improvements. Not usable for iPad users.

Updated:

Pushed out an update with few changes and still no landscape. I chalk it up to a cynical move to just wipe out 110s of 1 star reviews. Please get it together LinkedIn.

LinkedIn is a required standard for professional presence on the web. This application renders the mobile platform useless. Usability is weak. No iPad specific version. It is highly likely that you will make an embarrassing gaff with this app. Best to uninstall it.",4

I really enjoyed it as it was user friendly (missing minimal functions) and had the essentials that make linkedin a great professional tool.

The new app takes 80% of it away.  Hence, i rarely use this new app.  Why linkedin decided to change the entire interface and take away fun options like profile views is beyond us...

2015-12-02 04:36:40,a breath of fresh air! 👍👍👍,opening this new app experience was better than going outside on the first sunny day of spring after the coldest and rainiest winter comparable to the Ice Age. each tab perfectly addresses my business needs and keeps me invested in relationships with my professional network. so proud to be a LinkedIn member and can't wait for everything to come!,5
2014-10-15 15:42:23,Notification of messages is great!,"What I like most about the LinkedIn app is seeing that I have messages or contact requests by just looking at the icon on my phone and IPad. I don't have to actually go to the website to check for messages.

As with all apps there generally isn't access to all the full web based features.  If I get an email that someone has endorsed me for skills and I click open the email I am unable to see what they have endorsed me for. 

There is also no ability to edit my profile  from the app.

Have been happy with the updates and added capabilities that weren't accessible when the app first came out.

Disappointed that the IPad app was discontinued.",4
2015-01-17 17:59:54,Super tricky Premium free trial cancellation!,"Not a big fan of trying a service and not being able to cancel easily if you don't want it! Even the directions under the help section point you to a place on the app to cancel that doesn't exist! Then you have to manage your subscription in some obscure way to cancel before being billed under your Apple ID. Not a big fan of trickery plus there was no big ""premium"" service that I saw via the app.",3
2014-12-11 03:26:32,Not easy to use,"Not ease to use 
I can't manage groups from the app. 
If i see a message, i can't mark it as read unless I take the time to tap it. It takes way too long. 
Whin i click 'accept' on an email telling  me of a request to connect, the dang thing goes to Safari and gives me a message that I should 'get the app'. Can't it tell I have the app? The mail link works only if I jeep the app running in the background (and using up resources).",3
2014-08-02 13:40:31,Great as a job search tool,"I give the linked in app five stars because I have landed a job with some help from this app. 

Now I use it as a sales lead generator and for talent scoping with measurable results. Although I can't easily quantify it's effectiveness as a marketing tool because I don't know the ratings/qualified views of my communications. Yet, I firmly believe it has real marketing qualities as well. 

Disclaimer: I am not an employee nor currently an analyst covering LinkedIn, but I trade LNKD stock and have made money doing so in the past and in the present. So I subtract a star from my own rating for some biasing. You may want to subtract another star from my rating. So three stars, which gives LNKD some room to improve their app!

2013-11-08 17:58:38,"Good product, tough crowd to please!","I like Linked in.  I have used it from it's beginning.  Now I am mobile so much, I have to use the new App for iPad, and iPhone.   I like that it is fast.
I don't like that the paths are so pre-defined, and it seems there is little control I can exert other than learning the ins and outs of this interface.  So, it is frustrating, and seems limited.  I am a Sr. Testing Manager, so I may be harsh on it.   

I like the Linked in Product, Like that it is available as an app, and understand this is a 2nd pass.  Once the limitations are fewer, and the app more resembles the access we have on the desktop, you will have made the transition.

Thanks for your efforts and for trying to make it better.",4

Other apps will ask if you want to launch the app as opposed to LinkedIn which takes you to the web and then requires you to log in. I would use this app so much more if I could go straight from the email updates to the App that resides on my iPad or iPhone.....enhance the functionality please...",2
2013-04-19 02:25:41,Another change?,"I know it's been a while since LinkedIn changed the look of the app. However, it worked great before and I'm getting tired of the obligatory re-skin. It seems like one of my favorite apps changes their layout each week.

If you're a fan of sharing, then you'll get frustrated when the app freezes or doesn't load your link properly--or at all.

If you're a network junkie, then get your fix with the desktop version versus this. The mobile functionality and interface limit you. Endorsements and keeping tabs on your following are not simple acts on this app.",2
2011-11-06 17:53:02,Needs some work,"All in all this is a great companion to the PC based site. As long as you have access to your home computer or laptop once in a while you should be fine.

The App let me know I was losing my work (and wasting my time). 

I am forced from email to the app, but cannot complete my response with the app. I had to go to a desktop to reply to a simple request. 

Note - revisiting. This is still a problem. This app is not very helpful.",1

All I want to see are people that viewed my profile (now even harder to do because you offer private mode now 😑) and post updates to my profile.

Finally, It's more pleasant to use the Linkedin app than the FaceBook app! I'm not a prophet not a son of a prophet but I think LinkedIn will surpass Facebook in the near future.",4
2013-02-26 19:58:50,App needs to be more customizable,"The app needs to be customizable - at least so that you can provide more value for those who have paid memberships to LinkedIn . For example, I don't want to see 'LinkedIn Today' and want to fully unsubscribe from from all those feeds (currently - it defaults to following Pharmaceuticals and Health, Wellness, & Fitness). 

It would also be nice if it would allow users to customize the 'Recent Updates' default view. Some members don't use LinkedIn as a glorified version of FaceBook and don't want to see every article that gets 'liked', and so forth. I would like to be able to see just who connected with who, who updated profiles, etc., - just the basics.
App is also buggy - freezes, doesn't load fully, etc., as many other reviews here have pointed out. 

Make it customizable, and reflect the quality of the full site.",1
2012-09-12 02:06:54,"Not useful, but could be","Why doesn't this app open whenever I click on a news item from linked in in my email?  Instead I'm directed to safari where LinkedIn suggests I download it's app?  

And when I do login, I can't edit my profile or really do anything useful.  

It'd be nice if I could follow the blogs and news items from the companies and sectors I'm most interested in.  Find a way to give that to me or the app will be trashed and I'll stick to some of my other less industry specific news feed apps.",2
2016-08-25 00:55:29,Great platform.,App is very useful but would love to get some things improved.  Most social platforms don't do a good job of this as I imagine it reduces viewing but I'd like to know what's posted since my last opening of the app and not all the previous things.    Then to also put priority on people or topics so I can determine how deep to look or skip things I'm currently looking to follow (actively  vs passively),4
2010-01-12 03:25:19,Backup Problems,"While I generally enjoy the new iPhone LinkedIn app, I have noticed that when I sync my iPhone to my Mac and app data is backed up, there appear to be thousands and thousands of LinkedIn files which get backed up. The amount of time this takes renders the backup process, and thus the app, almost unusable. Inspecting these files in the backup folder seems to reveal they are “person records” of people I’ve never heard of.

This is either a bug that needs attending to or a basic problem with the design of the app.",1
2017-07-13 03:04:05,Leave the ease of the App!,"I don't take time to write reviews often; however, I really love the mobile features that this app gives me.  It allows me to stay in touch and network at ease, especially when I'm looking to find new connections. Great job on making this App a user friendly experience.",5
2017-04-26 16:32:22,Stop auto contact requests in app,"The LinkedIn app is notorious for trying to add all your contacts on your phone as connections in the app, and not just the first time you use the app, but almost every time you open it. This is annoying to both the user and their contacts (it's easy to accidentally press the button).
The app is not as robust as the desktop version and functionality like adding media links to your experience profile doesn't work in the app.",2
2017-02-07 04:19:43,Amazing App!,"One of the easiest business networking apps to date. Not only have I benefited financially from this app, I've also made friends who I connect with on a daily basis where we share and exchange information that benefits us all. Once you connect with similar people in your field, the possibilities are endless!",5
2016-09-05 19:40:06,Network,Hello everyone! If you are looking to build a network and open to the corporate world then LinkedIn is way to go. Definitely something I'll recommend someone who is willing to grow and live a better life with the better future. A lot of things are shared everyday which helps you expand your knowledge.... Best App ever!,5
2015-03-04 16:03:22,Work around for LinkedIn crash,"After updating to the latest release just pushed out, I, too, experienced that the app crashed upon launching. Ref: iPad Air 2 64GB iOS 8.1.3

Work around: I deleted the previous version from my spring board and reinstalled latest version from the App Store. I had to re-login to the app, but it worked correctly after that step.

Hope this is helpful.",4
2016-04-29 23:53:54,Go-to app for professional growth,With the fairly recent redesign the new LinkedIn app has become an invaluable platform for professional growth. I regularly read and often interact with business and thought leaders. I am also able to develop my own voice on the platform. Highly recommended!,5
2016-01-12 11:19:45,Love the newest updates,"I have used LinkedIn for a few years now, but rarely used it on my phone until now. I like how easy it is to engage with my network and see what others are posting and following. It does feel a lot more like Facebook now, but still has its unique features. I'm happy with it.",5
2015-12-31 18:00:54,New update FREAKING BLOWS,Please change it back to the older version. No one that I know or have talked to about this likes it at all. Don't know why it still hasn't been changed. I don't even want to use it anymore. It was nice to have it on my phone so I didn't feel like I had to get on my computer every time to do something. Now I feel like I have to again. This app used to motivate my future career as a 20 year old. Now I'm just done and all I do is play video games! Lol but foreal this update blows. Please change it. Literally makes me want to shoot my phone.,1
2015-12-08 12:38:04,Nice update that simplifies the user experience,"As a designer, I can see where this update is going. Gone are the mass amounts of custom UI in favor of an iOS-style user experience that will be faster to bring new features to users.

Every feature from the previous app might not be here (yet), but the team has set up a REALLY good foundation.",5
2015-12-06 15:24:31,Can't post company updates,"LinkedIn goes a long way to make sure your mobile experience is bad regardless of using their app or mobile site. I dare anyone to manage to post an update on behalf of their company, it's completely impossible on a mobile!  Really??? In nearly 2016???

I have been a fervent LinkedIn user (on desktop browser) from way before they were known by the wider public and I've installed and uninstalled this app so many times hoping they would get their act together a few iterations later. They have not to date.",1
2015-10-29 16:44:42,App will cause unintentional connections,"I actually like the app, but when it sent out 350 connections today when I was only trying to add 50, it got deleted. The app gets in your email and contacts list and tries to connect to everyone you've ever sat next to on a bus. It is an irresponsible way to write an app and makes me look foolish with my connections. Some of these people are folks that have poor business practices. I would never recommend them and now they are on my network. I can't cancel it either, or even see who all was added.",1
2015-07-08 12:45:27,What to say...It's LinkedIn!,"One of the best apps there is! Simple, yet to the point. I actually rely on LinkedIn to achieve, stay connected/visible, and keep up with all that is going around within/without my network.

Keep up the good work, and I am positive you are to surprise us by challenging yourselves in exceeding our expectations by far! 

Thank you!!!",5
2015-06-06 16:48:39,Can't write comments on iPad,"It's not convenient to write comments in the forums because the editing feature is not working consistently. The main issue is that the keypad covers up the editing window and the editing tools don't work. So if you use the forums the iPad (and probably iPhone) versions will not be useful. 

This is actually a problem with other apps as well, so maybe it's due to the age of my iPad, it's one of the earlier generations.",3
2015-04-16 20:22:40,Linked in=good their app=frustrating,"Your app stinks. I love the concept of linked in, love connecting, but your app stinks. Nothing updates, I get notified of the same notifications from 6 months ago. Profile updates are slow, it crashes a lot, gives the ""oops, looks like something got unplugged"" message, 5 times today trying to do different stuff. 
  The one thing I HATE about linked in, is its not user friendly. I have still yet to find how to change notifications, and they send me emails ALL THE TIME! ANNOYING! 
 Tech team, let's bring this app up to par huh?",1
2014-10-03 14:31:51,A good app,"It covers all the bases with a reasonable interface. 

If your goal is to get the primary functionality of LinkedIn in an app (I.e., get/ receive messages, connect with individuals, read articles) then the app works great.

(Update - the apps a lot better now, faster response times and more functionality. Only major complaint is that the interface is a little un- intuitive.)",4
2014-07-03 05:10:28,I like this App,"I don't like the fact that it's pushy that it wants to get into your contacts even after you tell it no, but the app itself is wonderful, and you can get connected with all your business professionals and friends and job opportunities in just a short time. When I am able to use the app more and get more familiar with the ins and outs I'll give it another review.
Sin Cera",4
2014-09-28 00:49:15,Awesome,"I started my entire company and built my current team using LinkedIn!!!!!! If you really work LinkedIn, it will literally grow your business!!! Best app and social media we could ever recommend. All of our foreign connections and deals have been achieved via LinkedIn! Our thanks to the founders at LinkedIn, who made TempOrthotics' founding possible!! Kudos!!!",5
2014-09-01 12:31:26,App version is slick,"I seem to be able to navigate this app easily. It seems to have everything the site has and handles links from the site (such as clicking on a person or list of people ""You may know"" link in an email when someone confirms connection) perfectly so far.",5
2014-08-26 01:57:18,Pivotal component of modern business,"LinkedIn has been a solid source to connect with thought leaders, timely information, resources, and business leads for me since BEFORE starting my company. As it continues to rollout new functionality it has remained a relevant and  essential component of my business which I value as much more than a social media portal.",5
2013-11-18 14:33:52,Almost perfect app,"Why won't the LinkedIn app open when I click on an invite link in an email. It's the most annoying thin to click the link, then be prompted to download the app(which I obviously already have), or to open the app. Then when I open it, I'm at square one again instead of being taken to the place I should have linked to. 
Otherwise I love this app.",4
2013-11-18 18:51:48,Good but simple mistakes that are annoying,"Love the app overall. The one thing that drives me nuts is the messaging center. Why would I not be able to see messages that I have sent? Every single time people contact me and I am waiting for the next response I am uncertain if I have even responded to them. Then I write again and look like a fool because I forgot which message I responded to already. 

Please, please enable message history so that it is easier to keep up to date with your conversations. 

Thanks",2
2013-11-10 19:16:46,Getting there,"Still a little cluttered, might be better on an iPad with more room to spread things out. Still can't do everything that the full web version allows, but at least it doesn't crash repeatedly anymore. Please fix so once I say ""no, I don't want you to invite everyone in my contacts list"", the app will remember this and not ask again.",4
2012-10-10 02:54:18,App has gotten better over time,This current version is considerably better than previous versions.  I would like to see the app open when a link is activated in an email. It is quite aggravating for the link open the website which requests that you download the app. There should be a way to indicate that you already have the app.,4
2013-09-05 19:24:13,Easy to Use - but not great,"LinkedIn is very easy to use, it's intuitive, and the profiles are very easy to navigate, unlike Facebook. My only complaint is the the substantive info you see on the iPhone app differs from the desktop site. I didn't look at my own profile on the full site for a few months, and realized that there was some fairly significant outdated info that I had not been seeing on my phone. NBD, but it was annoying.",3
2012-09-15 06:49:52,I like it,"I find this app to be quite helpful in managing my already created profile. I can add groups, invites, check in on connections and even get updates on my connections' actions and changes. 

And yes, I can do basic edits to my profile as well. Not as robust as the web version, but if you have an established profile, this app is very helpful. 

Also speedy. Can you dig it?  Seriously, can you?",4
2012-05-17 19:17:50,Good.,"Love the app!  Its one of the better ones that are made for networking. The only thing I would change is that you are able to see the members who view your profile. I hate that it says ""anonymous LinkedIn member"". If they put that then they should just show you the name or something, even if the picture doesn't have to be shown. Other than that, works great.",4
2012-06-14 05:02:04,I have tried ...,"... to like this iPad version of LinkedIn. It is 'noisy', cumbersome to use and lacks the information the iPhone version gives me. Not enough characters here for me to say what needs to change and how it should look. But this over pretentious app is frustrating and wasteful of the real estate on an iPad screen. Give me information not pages and pages of cr@p. please note I have not mentioned the security issue nor the way LinkedIn moves your calendar down to one of their machines. That is unforgivable. Do not recommend this app on an iPad, usable on the iPhone ... just.",1
2012-04-28 16:43:33,"Format is nice, but missing some thought",The formatting of the update is nice.  We're not using a overblown iPhone app anymore... But it seems to be missing functionality. Business today is on the move; we cannot/should not have to sign into a site up upload an image or to edit the profile.  I should be able to do everything from my iPad and more!,4
2017-08-04 05:43:51,Better with every update!,"The app is really becoming more than a networking platform. There seems to be much more participation by professionals to provide content, stories, and helpful advice then there once was. I find myself spending more and more time browsing the app and reading content. Keep it up!",5
2012-02-17 11:58:56,Patience is Thin with Linked-In,"After all this time, how is it possible that Linked-In has not made a native iPad version.    For a service that prides itself on being the platform for professionals, Linked-In behaves most unprofessionally.   Most users I know have the same complaint .   Will Linked-In please tell us whether and when they will catch-up with every other social network by issuing an iPad version.",3
2011-08-25 01:26:57,Functionality?,"Thought it was just okay before this update, but it seems the limited functionality it did have is now gone. I found the favorites function useful but it is no longer there. The network updates are redundant. No folders for organizing. All in all appreciate the effort (and it is free after all), but not a useful app as it stands right now. Would love to see an update soon- and the ability to sync desktop and mobile account with folders or favorites.",2
2017-04-20 18:11:16,Best Social  Media Networking Platform EVER,"Since Joining LinkedIn some months back I've already connected with almost 2000 people in all professions and my network is expanding constantly.  

Almost like the ""Big Bang"" of networking platforms LinkedIn is a HIT and once I got in I was hooked, and the invites come in almost daily .

two thumbs up for LinkedIn 👍👍",5
2017-03-30 00:56:19,The real Timeline and Newsfeed,"This is my preferred tool for staying up to date. The amount of news outlets included, connections with my coworkers, and ability to stay up to date with my existing network is great. I also find linkedIn useful in planning long term for where I'd like to be and what skills are needed to get there. (MSFT employee)",5
2017-01-30 17:12:38,The most professional networking app.,"This is a great app. Its easy to find people you already know, but also those you really need to or want to meet. LinkedIn has been around for years, but now it is the goto for employees and employers to find and post jobs and research each other before meeting.",5
2016-10-01 00:22:29,Loving it,"With Every update it just get better and better. Easy navigation, almost all functions of full site. I wish if there is an attachment function for messages in app as they have it on desktop version. Also I would like to rearrange the different sections on my profiles that you can only do it on desktop version.
Overall very good app.!",4
2017-01-11 15:49:19,Great for networking,"A one stop shop for all of your networking needs. A great way to connect with former colleagues and employers. Also, a great way to job hunt for those better opportunities that you've been looking for. You couldn't ask for a better tool when it comes to your professional networking needs.",5
2015-06-04 18:20:45,Great Networking Site!,"LinkedIn is a great networking website. I didn't think it could be done but they have created a productive social network that is a great asset to working individuals. It gives you all types of updates business information, articles to read and even employment opportunities. Looking for a social network that is not a waste of time this would be it..!",4
2016-05-05 01:03:09,Staying Connected With Colleagues in an Enjoyable Way,LinkedIn seems to be an enjoyable way to stay connected with professional colleagues and others in my community. It's frequent updates seem to keep it fresh and engaging. My only regret is that it's becoming too much like Facebook increasing personal content and risks losing its distinctiveness.,5
2016-01-08 13:45:21,New App - Poor update,"Agree wholeheartedly with the prior comments that this version is very poorly executed.
It keeps asking (more so) for my contact list.
It keeps showing the same 'likes' / feedback from multiple people, so one ends up seeing the same graphics, articles over and over again.
Someone commented about invites and updates grouped into one, that adds one more 'click' to sort through...
One can keep going, but really not sure what was the driver to take something working (maybe not the best) and run it to the ground.",1
2013-02-19 06:11:39,Can't view member's profiles,I'd love to give this app 5 stars because it is well made and organized. It offers great service. It's just way too buggy. I can't view others who have viewed my profile to see if I know them. It just comes up blank. It it doesn't seem possible to limit the post of colleagues who have too much activity. Where is the hide button?,4
2015-05-13 12:00:59,You are missing out if you don't have LinkedIn,Easy to use and keeps me up to dated on my contacts. It's a wonderful app for all careers. This app got me discovered by my dream gig! I went from a local audio engineer in Brooklyn to touring all over the world with a Grammy awarding artist just from keeping my profile updated! LinkedIn changed my life!,5
2015-02-10 00:44:50,Great but needs connectivity from email,"Love LinkedIn!  However, and this is a big however, when I receive a notice about an article on LI and I click on it it doesn't send me into my app, instead it requests my email and password each time...even though I have the app open. This is frustrating as I can rarely find the article through a search from the app. Seems basic but needs to be addressed.",3
2014-03-13 14:35:55,Link does not open iPhone app / Messages folder incomplete,"I just can't understand why when I click on a link from LinkedIn email it does not open the application on my iPhone! It's really boring having to log on everytime on the web based linkedin instead of using the application.

Also, why on the messages section on the iPhone application I can't see the sent messages, just the ones in my inbox?",3
2013-09-05 17:43:15,Weak,"Nothing in this app feels natural. It's very counter intuitive. It feels like LinkedIn tried so hard to not be like social media (Facebook) that they made it backwards. I.e. I'll get a notification, like the red dot with the #2 in it over the app icon. Then I'll open the app, find one thing right away like a connect request. Then spend 30 minutes looking for the other thing. I'll give up and have a red 1 on the app until I delete and reinstall. This app is garbage.  I feel bad for members with a paid sub.",2
2013-06-18 16:16:52,Need search capabilities improved.,"Having a paid subscription, I live the ability to do advance searching. But that capability is not translated to the mobile app. Since I travel for business, I tend to use the mobile version quite often, but find the mobile search feature very poor   I will Google someone I am interested and get quicker, better results in finding LinkedIn records than using the LinkedIn search feature in the LinkedIn app. Please work on this!",2
2013-05-31 01:27:27,Great Professional Tool!!,"Works great - use this app several times each day for networking, leads, and learning.

LinkedIn was already my favorite Social Media Website, but they now also have the best Mobile Application with their latest release.

The LinkedIn contact app is also the best contact app, and Card munch is also a phenomenal tool!",5
2013-03-21 13:30:50,Not Perfect But Love It!,"It has crashed a few times on me but folks it is free! Awesome calendar integration, great tool to get insights on professional contacts and sleek interface. Taught me today that one of my clients just took a new job and that is why I had not heard back from them. How many apps will do that for you? Just download it already.",5
2013-03-14 12:01:49,Almost Useless,"I'm on my iPhone or iPad for virtually 80-90% of my personal web browsing. I hate that I need to log in to LI via my desktop browser in order to just make edits to my full profile.  Also, when I click on an email link, there aren't any hooks to try launching the LI app, only ""Get the App"" or ""No Thanks"" on your mobile site.  YOU ARE THE ONLY DEVELOPER I'VE ENCOUNTERED that falls this flat with the synergy between platforms. 

I recently got a new iPhone and will not install until these issues are worked out.",2
2012-03-23 05:26:52,Love it But...,"Love the app. Ive only had it for a couple days and I have already use ls the website more than I have in the last yr. I just think its missing a couple of major functions. I want to be able to edit my profile in this app and recommend ppl!! 

I think if they added those features it would be perfect.",4
2011-12-15 05:40:13,Beautiful app  would be better with these changes,"The linkedin app is just gorgeous and I love using it daily.
However, it is disappointing that I cannot email an article to myself. It will also be nice if you added instapaper integration.
An easy way to search for my contacts would also make the app a lot more useful.",4
2011-12-17 01:45:49,Spotty performance,"For all the supposed improvements over the last version (there has been some, at least), this app's performance still has some leaps and bounds to go. Too many times do I get stuck on a page that just keeps loadin' and loadin'and never loads! 

It's cool to make your app look cool and all (serious props to the original design), but design means nothing if we can't use it. That's what art is for!",3
2011-10-03 22:43:53,Fantastic new look,"I must say, whoever you used to develop the latest version of your app did a fantastic job.

Now if you could only redesign your actual website with the same principals...",5
2011-09-08 03:11:08,I like it a lot,"Super sleek, easy to use, runs great.  I don't know what people are complaining about.  The point is to Check for new messages and updates on the go... Doesn't mean it needs to have every single function that the website does (edit profile, etc).  App is great for what it is meant to be used for.",5
2009-09-11 23:52:31,Not functional ,"Beenusing the web site for years and love it. However, the app is useless. Too few features. Search options are of no use. Would love to use this app on the road but can't. 

This app might work for someone with less than 50 connections.",5
2014-08-13 19:21:26,Good App Not Perfect,"The LinkedIn app works good, runs fast on my iPhone 5c, but seems to try to cram too much information in such a little space.  Invites tend to be cut off, so they may be hard to see, making the decision to accept or not a little bit of a guessing game.  Other than that, the app is fine and works as one would expect it to work.  I recommend it without hesitation.",4
2008-11-18 00:38:50,New Release is a Step Backwards,"I'm a Linked In addict and WAS very pleased with the application's features. Yesterday, I downloaded the latest release (after receiving notification). Now, when someone in my Linked In community adds a contact I can only see the name of the added party, but can't click/touch their name for more information (unlike the first visual shown).  Dilutes the whole point of the application. The previous release was better.  ",2
2017-09-07 21:23:11,Garbage notifications,"Actually sends push notifications to say ""alert your notifications are turned off and you have no notifications."" Yeah, I know, I turned them off because they were worthless garbage. I don't need to be reminded everyday that Joe Blow and Jack MeHoff might be in my network. Shockingly, I still don't want to connect to these yahoos after the first time I saw their names. Otherwise, I guess the rest of the app works if your interested unrelated political opinions and affiliation shaming.",2
2017-08-10 22:04:29,Linkedin Has a Great App,"The LinkedIn app is very easy to use. It's easy to find your contacts, profile, and jobs. You can share articles and links to your work.

2016-11-15 11:24:00,Be prepared to get angry!,"Not only has linkedin become a sorry second fiddle to facebook, but the app is infuriating!  Every time you log in it wants to walk you through how to operate the app in a very extensive ""this is how you click the ""x"" button you dumb***"" sort of way.  Like most people who ""use"" linkedin, I'm an adult with a master's degree.  I think I can figure out how to operate your oh-so-complex CIA level app interface.  Give me a break.

2016-02-10 21:52:07,Today's update,"When I read ""sharing is even easier"" 😑 
To LinkedIn: Sharing is driving social networks to becoming absolute crap! Don't think that you need to be more like Facebook. Stay with your niche market.

Don't make the same mistake.",3
2016-01-14 03:33:56,Litigation Support Consultant,"I'm not knocking LinkedIn for needing to generate revenue it's paid subscriptions, but given the fact that the overwhelming majority of members are using free accounts they should allow more visibility about who views your profile.  Also, in the spirit of networking they should also allow for a limited number of inmail messages to be sent to 2nd and 3rd degree contacts.
Change those two things and the app is a shoe in for five stars.",3
2016-01-05 16:34:27,"Actually, -5 Stars","If I could rate without stars, I would.  The most recent version basically wiped out my central news source.  I loved Pulse, used it everyday. As a retiree, i don't need or want  LinkedIn.  I was shocked when I tried to access Pulse yesterday and was forced to go thru LinkedIn, yet still could not access any of my previous favorite news sites.  I don't understand why App Developers continue to take something like Pulse that worked and was useful, and change it so that it drives away so many of their long-time happy users.  Huge fail LinkedIn!",1
2016-01-01 13:31:50,Terrible,"This new update is awful. 

It seems like I get more info from LinkedIn emailing me updates, than from the regular app.

I can't figure out how to endorse people - do I have to literally sign in from my laptop? I have a phone for a reason you know. I downloaded the app for convenience.

I don't like the layout of everything. It's confusing and even after a couple weeks of the update, I still can't figure it out. 

I know it won't go back to the way it was... But it needs to. I don't need another Facebook. I want to see what my connections are up to - new jobs, promotions... Like I said, my emails from LinkedIn tell me way more than the app does at this point. Makes the app completely worthless.

I have to wonder when apps change like this... Who signs off on them? I mean, really? My nine year old could have designed a better product.",1
2015-10-19 19:01:38,Hit and Miss,"I find the app a little bit uneven for the following reasons. To manage your contacts and social network it excels at this. However both the job search functions and the application functions are frequently disconnected. For instance your LinkedIn link will frequently fail when attempting to use your LinkedIn to apply for a particular position. Dropbox function is much more useful than the native API/link.

2015-08-31 12:45:05,Founder of Elephant Technology (Boston/Dublin/NYC),"Stability for this App is major challenge for me in terms of Trust. ""an error has occurred"" after composing and sending a message has burned me more times than I can count. If draft copies of InMail were captured this frustration would be moot.

A smaller concern timing out when clicking through on a profile or loading websites from within the App. Disappointing web performance for a company with such great performance engineers. Perhaps it is an API issue but the UX from my POV is sufficiently frustrating that I no longer use the LinkedIn App for candidate discovery/learning. 

Is this slow load performance problem caused by API or Database issues? I'm sincerely curious about the source of the problem.

In summary: I wish this App were better. I look forward to future releases addressing the gaps.",2
2015-08-12 13:46:06,Just wanted to look someone up,"Just wanted to look someone up on the mobile app. Nope. Can't do that. LinkedIn insists on ""enhancing my experience"". Made me go through several steps to revise my profile, connect with more people, pull in email addresses off my phone that aren't on LinkedIn (seemed a little intrusive), etc. finally skip through all these stupid steps and it still wouldn't let me into the site. All I wanted to do was look someone up! Complete failure and waste of time. Deleted the app off my phone. No wonder the stock is off some 30%",1
2015-06-12 03:08:46,Half an app,"Have the developers ever used an iPhone? Do they understand how notifications work? I don't need a notification of someone adding me AFTER I've accepted them. You have to refresh at least 3 times to clear notifications you've already dealt with. The app operates slowly in general, and feels like an app from 2009 they are trying to force on 2015. I wish you weren't a professional requirement cause the LinkedIn service is an embarrassment. Get it together before someone replaces you.",2
2015-04-16 13:17:07,Great tool to locate and find professionals,"As mentioned above, Linked In has been a great tool for network, locating suppliers/customers, or receiving company updates. Only pitfalls that I've faced are the job postings are not up to date and it's difficult to find articles written by your connections using the search function.",5
2014-12-27 16:27:08,"Nail the UI, then exploit the Data","I am a huge fan of the app and Jeff and his leadership team. 

That said, the mobile and desktop UI are still nowhere near where it could be with the capabilities available these days. For a B2C model this HAS to be nailed. Now.

For your aspirations in the enterprise/institution, the data intel you are amassing and the search capabilities are your secret weapons but direct them somewhere specific. Education pathways and what we can do with MOOCs is my bet for you and Jaime Casap is your man along with Daniel Tunkelang. Make It Work!",2
2014-11-26 23:40:22,Showing people they way they really are !,I have been using linkedin for over 6 years and saw the network and accuracy grow to a level where it became the whitepages for business people showing what we are are all about .... unlike other social tools who show what we wanted to be ...in nice pictorial views :),5
2014-05-15 15:59:19,Essential Networking Tool,"The app is not perfect, but it is convenient to use and allows for quick monitoring of others status, news feed, job opportunities.  The ability to both request and approve requests make this an essential professional networking tool.  It is also perceived as a less intimidating way to cold call.   In 2014 you need to be linked in.",4
2014-08-03 13:49:39,Serviceable,"This is a decent application. It allows me to view my contacts, news updates, and other things that interest me. The only thing that I really don't like about it, is that when I click on an article link in my email, it does not go to the article directly. 

Rather, it opens up the webpage and offers me the opportunity to see it in the app, but when I open the app it does not show me the article.",3
2014-02-18 13:43:38,App still needs work,"Linked In is a great site, that I have booked a few jobs through. The mobile app, and the links from push notification/ email notifications need to communicate better so you don't have to search for the notification when you get to the app. All in all, a great product, with a few minor issues.",4
2014-05-08 07:33:36,Better then the site,"As a fashion photographer I use LinkedIn regularly to make connections with designers, agencies, clients, models, magazines, art directors, makeup artists, stylists and of course other photographers and friends in Philadelphia and NYC.  

I love the set up to add people far more on the app then on the site. I think combined between the two LinkedIn can be very useful for networking",5
2014-04-01 20:48:35,"Good app, but ""who's viewed"" is a joke","I've always been a fan of linked in, and can attest to its value in the workplace for screening candidates, as well as, marketing oneself for a new position. 
As far as the app itself, the requirement to pay to see ""who's viewed your profile"" is asinine at best... Being in the IT mobile space, I view their approach as a'non-functioning' feature. Thus the three star rating. All other functions of the app seem to work well.",3
2014-03-17 15:51:59,Very Professional Social Networking,This app has helped me find a lot of the professional people out there that have given me the great knowledge base I have with the industry I have worked in for 30 years. The advantage is I can now contact them with questions that are in their expertise areas and continue to add knowledge to my industry.,5
2014-03-04 00:56:21,Much improved and now it's great!,"Didn't think this would happen when the app was first released years ago, but it's way better now. The interface is intuitive and I can do everything I need to do on a regular basis. I can't remember the last time I visited the desktop website. Was 2 stars now 5. Great app!",5
2013-04-19 04:10:33,Satisfactory user experience,"Improves every new version. Though I have not upgraded to the very latest just release Apr 2013. I almost exclusively use the app for my LinkedIn networking. Now, if they only stopped trying so hard to make the mobile web site look like the app, the web interface on mobile devices delivers a horribly poor user experience.",4
2014-01-30 03:23:25,Works Well but app is limited.,"I generally like this app for what it allows me to do which is generally endorse others or look at my feed but it is still lacking in the functionality of the main web site. I would like to see an improved job search interface as well as the ability to recommend others easier. Otherwise, the app does the bare minimum of what you should expect.",3
2014-01-07 17:06:45,2 accounts,"Thanks for your amazing service, that would be great if u guys could add a feature to link 2 LinkedIn accounts, I have an account for friends and family and another one for business I want to link or sync these 2 accounts to be able to receive my emails in one account",5
2013-10-26 12:20:36,Business Connections,"The app is wonderful in its ability to interact with other business professionals and clientele worldwide. It gives you the ability to stay in contact with your mentors, colleagues and other known associates over the year as you progress in life. Wonderful app and I love the constant changes you make, subtle but exquisite.",5
2013-08-20 01:26:02,App needs to be reviewed ASAP,"The app for the iPad is not up to par with today's technology at all. Like another user stated, it does crash often, constantly tells me I have no updates, yet I just received an email of a new connection request, and when you log in directly to the app rather then link supplied in the email, if you click on notifications and try and accept a request, you get an error every time! The error reads ""oops something went wrong, please try again later. Please fix issues and push out an update thanks!",1
2017-02-16 21:51:58,Quick and easy to use!,"I use this app all the time, it is probably the ""social media"" app that I use the most. I got an amazing internship through a contact I made through Linked In so I know it works. The only thing o wished this app had would be an option of sending a customized message to people I send an invitation to connect like on the desktop version.",4
2012-05-03 05:41:17,Absolutely love it,"I love the organization of the app and all of its expanded pages, I easily see many useful things I would miss or even forget existed on the web version. The profile view is awesome for being able to toggle quickly from the bio info to the actions page. It's modern, innovated and easy to use, great job!",5
2011-08-15 03:23:06,Could be so much more,"I agree with most other reviews, the functionality of this app is basic at best. An app should enhance or at least compliment the whole, we use apps because we are busy people being pulled in numerous directions and our smart phone allows us to be more efficient. How am I to efficiently moderate my groups when the app really does not allow me to do much other than check who sends me an invite. I hope the company does better than this in future updates.",2
2011-05-26 17:11:15,Needs Groups and Profile Editing!,"The one thing I use linkedin for on a consistent basis is connecting with groups.  I rely on groups to further my professional development.  It is an asset that makes linkedin special.  So why isn't it available through the app?  Also, perhaps I want to change my picture or other personal data while on the go.  Adding these two features would boost my rating of 2 stars to 4 automagically.",2
2010-07-08 01:06:58,OK but doesn't do enough to be a good mobile font end,"There is no way to view or post to group discussions, which are a major part of the community. Furthermore, the regular web page version doesn't do well on Mobile Safari either (not optimized for mobile). 

If you and your friends post status updates constantly, then this lets you do that pretty well.",3
2017-03-27 15:59:28,AGRESSIVE Notifications,"What I HATE about LinkedIn's app is that they AGGRESSIVELY abuse push notifications! Even though my settings on the app say only send push notifications on receiving a new message, the app will actually send a new push notification on EVERY notification from the app, e.g. someone in my network has a birthday..... which happens ALL the time. This is an abuse of trust and privileges by LinkedIn, and I highly doubt it's an honest tech bug. Not cool! Because I use my phone for professional work, those notifications bugger up my work flow. So I've deleted this app.",1
2017-03-16 15:33:25,Mobile Resume,"LinkedIn allows me to keep my resume current and working for me. I'm more likely to send my profile than a file to potential clients or partners because the full picture of who I am professionally includes not only my background, but who I know and what they say about my performance.",5
2017-02-09 07:09:54,Need to keep track of my posts,"I post a lot of pictures of my products as advertisement. I don't like how what I like gets merged together with what I post. Also there should be a way where I can easily refresh my posts so they can recirculate. Right now I wait a couple of weeks and then like my own picture, that usually gets it back up again.",4
2016-08-04 10:50:34,Pursuing Hassle Elimination Learning Process (HELP),"Since joining LinkedIn during it's rapid application prototyping phase, I've observed a persistent pursuit of excellence!  Same ethos drives developing mobile platform iOS Apps ... 

It's a challenge to translate more robust web browser functions to an agile but usable iPad or iPhone App that delivers all end-user features &'functions!  Having adjusted my expectations, I'm delighted by latest version.",4
2017-01-11 20:32:02,Years of pain to a moment of healing,"I love the idea that years of pain can be healed in a moment. If that is the work, then let us all do it all the time. I think that there is also the moment of pain that may need years to heal. And that is work we all must also do. Thank you, Danielle, for the insight and inspiration.",5
2016-09-15 18:34:01,It improved my work flow.,"I have used LinkedIn for over ten years, but their app improves and improved my work flow dramatically.  I get notes that I have an update from a connection in the alerts on my smartphone.  It's easy to see what people discuss in my Groups, and I don't worry about missing important details.",5
2015-01-15 22:00:03,Business App we all need,This is a must have app if you are a working adult over the age of 25 years old.  I can keep in contact with ex coworkers without introducing them to my private life on Facebook or Google+.  Also an excellent venue to network and get business advice.  Only problem is the visual layout is ugly.  It probably drives marketing people crazy.  Other than that 4/5 for me.,4
2016-05-05 04:46:54,Best app for career. Period.,"The LinkedIn app is not only good for job seekers and networking (it IS good for those too). It's also great for keeping up on industry news, thought leadership, and staying in touch. Used correctly, it can even raise your organization's profile, in a good way. And the app makes it convenient to use anytime, anywhere.",5
2016-05-04 13:03:15,The Business Card of the New Economy,A very serious career tool - social networking for professionals. iOS mobile version provides seamless navigation. Can't describe how valuable LinkedIn and this mobile app have been towards helping me stay in touch with important business contacts across time and space.,5
2016-04-30 16:46:42,Good app to connect with like-minded professionals!,I enjoy using the Linked-In app! I like to see what others in my field have to say about my field as well as life and living in the world each day. I enjoy the encouraging quotes as well as articles posted in my own area of expertise to keep up with everything that's going on! Great app!,5
2016-04-25 21:46:18,Linkedin,"Great app! Since using it, I have built an incredible network or professionals in my same field. The app gives you the latitude to share, obtain feedback and learn about what is new in your profession. Connecting with people from all over the globe provides expanded knowledge of diverse experiences from those who do what you do.",5
2016-03-11 02:35:17,General bug fixes...,"This is probably the second app review I've ever written. Your app has annoyed me enough to write this review, congrats!

LinkedIn has been known in the past to have leaked user's personal information collected through tactics it's still using; trying to obtain all users contacts, every single time the app is updated.

I can't wait until I'm a robot, so I only have to burn a bit of CPU, rather thank click that camouflage Skip button of yours. Nice strategy, but robots don't give a crap about networking socially... one day, I'm going to get you so so good.",1
2016-01-07 16:51:18,Updates have improved the app dramatically,"Great app. Really used it for a services Rolodex when it first appeared. Now I find it more involved to my daily business. Target groups, opportunities and connections are all here. The new pulse is much better as well. Very good tool for any professional. As with any tool, you must use it or it will rust.",5
2015-12-31 17:11:03,Thank you for killing a really good app.,"This app is horrible...  At one time it was very useable and worthwhile.  Now it is garbage.  It is unusable.  I can't see who wants to link, or who has recently linked to me.  I can't search for new links.  Etc...  What's the point of the app?

This app is clever, mysterious (you can't find anything and the main page is at least two days behind the LinkedIn home page in other places), but not useful.  As others have said, it can't stand alone anymore--so what is the point of wasting this space on my phone???

It was a good app...  Glad I kept an old version on the iPad--at least I can still use that!  I can at least see connections and who has new connections!!!

You need to go back and find out what makes a useful app again...  What your customers need.  Otherwise I need to free up space on my phone...",1
2015-09-10 10:48:20,LinkedIn,Very simple easy to navigate but lacks on function of full fledge web version but has the functional stuff one needs very simple to use lacks function you would think.  from a general user standpoint it seems to work and function with little to no issues however it could be more configurable as far as what one could view and what one must view in order to satisfy.,3
2015-09-09 12:09:30,Email Functionality,"Can't even access sent emails within the app. Did the intern programming it understand that sent email boxes exist for more than a few reasons? Also, when I first installed it, it asked if I wanted notifications. I clicked no. Then, because it's LinkedIn, I had a feeling my request was ignored so I went into my notifications settings and could you believe that it was set into full notifications? Ha! Luckily, I nipped that one in the bud and disabled all notifications. Good try!",2
2015-07-28 03:36:58,LinkedIn Review with suggestions,"I have been using LinkedIn for many years and for the most part have met interesting and professional people. I would suggest to LinkedIn programmers that a Premium user should have the choice to BLOCK Anonymous viewers which is like stalking.
Additionally, I have also encountered the Nigerian scammers who were able to set up phony profiles from genuine people. Surely LinkedIn has the ability to detect IP addresses from Nigeria??",3
2015-06-05 04:35:52,Awesome app,Linkedin app makes it really convenient to access msgs and access your profile. I want to see how they bring they are working on improving the job search page in the mobile app. The search functionality in the app works amazingly and its fairly easy to navigate.,5
2015-04-03 13:42:27,One of my top 5 apps,"LinkedIn is my window to the business world.  It is a great way to research the background of people you will be working with, network with professionals having a common link, or find an article that you can share on a hot business topic.  I reference it several times a week, at minimum.",5
2015-01-19 21:45:56,Limited if you are using a cell phone as your primary resource.,I signed up using my cell phone and intended to use Linked In as a networking and job search tool. I found the features limited with regard to job searching and once I set up my profile I could not adjust the photo or add skills over time ... I searched thinking perhaps I was just an uninformed user. Turned out i needed to use a computer to do these things. :/,3
2015-01-12 17:16:23,Awesome! BUT the 'App' needs more capability!,Love LinkedIn but I have a BIG problem with people being able to see MY profile anonymously! If people want to snoop into my info then I want to know WHO they are!! The app also needs to have an easy way to remove a 'link' and/or block them. How about also teaming up with IMDB to be able to link & edit both profiles via the LinkedIn 'app'?,4
2014-11-05 01:32:51,Probably addicted to LinkedIn,"I would say I use linkedin more than even Facebook.
Professional networking is much more of a need today. Other social networkings will come and pass by but professional networking will grow everyday. And thanks to linkedin to make such a smooth networking experience.
Just love the app.",5
2014-11-14 04:54:22,Can't Edit ANYTHING,"This is essentially a Read Only version of LinkedIn.. 
The accessibility and navigation are great from the iPad but holy-geez if you're needing to update ANYTHING, (subscribed-to group email preferences, new position, contact info, skill sets, etc.,) you better have your smartphone in one hand and your tablet in the other. On the iPhone app I can do everything necessary. On the iPad app, it looks cleaner but I can't do anything except that of a 'Read Only' file. For my own profile. Get it together, Linked...",2
2014-01-16 15:37:23,Psychologist,"Love LinkedIn.  Used Very professionally by members. Increases ability to connect nationwide.  Only problem is some people I try to connect with that I want to know based in reputation is blocked by LinkedIn if I don't have their personal contact info.   I thought that was the point, to connect & exchange info.  As far as I know, they have the right to decline if they wish.    Otherwise I love it.",4
2014-08-26 00:36:38,I love this place.,"It's like Facebook, but with a reason to make an account.  I've had multiple people endorse profitable skill sets that I have been working on for years, making me more competitive in job searches.  It's like a 'like' button for my ability to do stuff.  And not a single candy crush invite!",5
2014-03-18 17:43:30,Great,I really like LinkedIn as a professional networking site. It has some great links to job opportunities and some really interesting professional conversations. There are some issues of course. There is a great deal of spam sent to my email that I constantly have to monitor. The app works very well with the website.,5
2013-04-19 01:19:04,Easy way to use most LinkedIn features on your phone,"I've been using this app for nearly a year, and overall I find it very useful. However, I do wish that the Job Search feature worked in the app. I also wish  that it was easier to find/join groups of interest from the app, but other than that it's been a great app to have!",4
2013-08-01 19:17:49,Nice app with a Few Limits,"I love having my contacts on the go and I also love the sister app CardMunch. The issue I've had with the app is it does not allow you to add a personal message when requesting to connect with someone. Also, it won't show me the connection's email address to write down or something but only wants to link to my email account and immediately send an email. Annoying. It does occasionally crash.",3
2013-07-15 01:44:40,I like the iPhone version. This could be good but needs more.,I have a problem where I don't get any updates. The main screen always says there are no updates. I wish this was more like the iPhone version but with more to maximize the screen. This just doesn't offer enough. I also agree with another comment that iPad never realizes you have this downloaded. It always asks me to download the app instead of just taking me to it. I love LinkedIn but this app needs a lot more.,2
2013-05-30 23:52:03,"Yes, but with some reservation.","Not an app geek so can't give all the derails but the new features take a little getting used to. I kind of liked the ""dashboard"" design as a starting point. Don't like that in order to clear a new contact notification you have to go to their profile. But overall I prefer the new design.",5
2013-03-18 00:18:59,UPDATE - works great now,"I honestly have no idea what this app even looks like... I've never been able to successfully open it, as it crashes on start-up every time.

2009-10-11 07:04:28,Needs the dashboard that converts Outlook to a personal assistant.,"I like that LinkedIn, as a free program, allows me to see and even post updates, and allows me to review other items. But I would pay for a version that uses my calander, contacts and my LinkedIn account to create a personal dashboard I can start each day with. That would be awesome.",4
2013-01-14 13:35:13,Doesn't open from LinkedIn Updates!,"I've downloaded every update in the hope that they will finally fix this hugh flaw, but months later, app still won't open from Linked In update emails. Instead, it takes you to a screen asking you if you want to get the app or ""no thanks.""  I already have the app, but it doesn't allow you to open the app from the email, or even go to the desktop version. Instead it just gets stuck!  Starts a spinning wheel that never loads!  C'mon developers, time to fix this ridiculousness!",1
2012-02-28 22:20:07,Not intuitive at all,"It provides the relevant information but took me a few minutes to figure out how to get to it all. It's definitely not intuitive. Also, it's not much use if you can update your own profile through a mobile device especially since mobile computing is many times the primary source of Internet access.",3
2011-12-03 09:32:27,Robust iPhone App! Need iPad version,"The new iPhone app is a good evolution of the LinkedIn smartphone platform.  I am sure the developers are working on this, but I would like to use an iPad version of the app as well. In my opinion, it is no longer acceptable to launch an app without having both the iPhone and iPad versions ready at the same time. 
If LinkedIn wants to keep users on their site longer, an iPad version is not a ""nice to have"" but a latent customer need.",3
2011-08-17 03:11:09,"Better, but still not there yet","The new interface looks slick but the functionality hasn't changed much. While I can make a connection with new people or see updates from current connections, I still can't update my profile, my photo, or look at job postings. These features are no less important than what is currently on the app, if not moreso. Hopefully they'll be on a soon-to-be-released version.",3
2017-01-08 05:01:12,I love LinkedIn,"My only suggestions are 
1.) allow us to organize our timeline on the app (i.e. Most popular/most recent.
2.) designate a section on our page just for pictures. 
3.) make our our ""posts"" section on our individual pages easier to find and more expansive. In my opinion, our posts should be the meat of our page on the app.",4
2017-06-22 16:41:18,Not Very Intuitive,"This review is more a suggestion than anything else. I find when I use LinkedIn that it is not very intuitive. Two specific things come to mind. Firstly, I cannot easily view my own profile. I ended up typing in my own name in the search box to find my profile to make changes and adjustments. Secondly, it's not apparent how to go about endorsing other people. I still haven't found that.",3
2017-05-26 00:37:32,Good app. Great tool!,"Great way to plug into your LinkedIn account. Great way to look up resumes of meetings participants. I would like to see a feature that includes LinkedIn member lookup by email address and the ability to categorize segments of your network by both standard and custom labels e.g. petroleum, political, family, country etc. 
Overall, I give it an A+!",5

And I don't have the option of turning that off!! This website/app has done nothing for me professionally, and nowadays, it's more like Facebook. People posting quote images or pictures of themselves at a party or of what they're eating. If all I'm getting is daily useless notifications that I can't turn off, it's probably time to delete it altogether.",2
2017-02-02 06:47:13,I love the new update,"LinkedIn takes getting use to as building a professional brand is not exactly easy. However, once you get the hang of LinkedIn, you can start to visualize your growth on LinkedIn.

I like this app and I hope future updates remain in the same direction.",5
2016-02-12 15:19:29,Pretty good,"While LinkedIn has become the go to social network for business, l still like the prior version better.  The job search app is rather weak.

It has gotten to the point where I can't even read an article because the second I close the App Store it pops right back up. Super annoying. Besides that glitch, the app is alright. Super easy to navigate.",3
2015-12-27 13:27:56,Totally Unusable App,"I'm not sure who was left in charge of the design for the new App but, it's evident they never used LinkedIn out side of a web browser. 

Until now, most (if not all) of my LinkedIn usage was through the App (iPhone and iPad). The changes have relegated a once powerful tool to gadget status. 

The inability to view the app in landscape is absurd. Who uses a tablet in portrait? This is not the same style of social media as Facebook and Twitter. It's a business tool and it should be devoid of a ""cutesy"" unusable UI and go back to the design that made it functional and useful. In it's current state it's nothing more than an app to pass the time while waiting in a lobby or airport. 

Since it appears the designers are far out of touch with how the App Is used they should conduct some focus groups with actual users. 

Don't obverthink or overengineer this.",1

This often results in user confusion and frustration when features and functions change with no real purpose or reason. The recent changes to LinkedIn app are a great example. I deleted it and will just use the website instead.",2

I used to look at this app on my iPad (on a keyboard stand) in the morning with my news and coffee but experience is not so much now. I only go in the app now only if I have a notification, mainly invite. There are some other UX changes that make me question where they are headed...seems like they are trying to be the big social site a little too much.",2

2011-08-20 20:29:32,I don't get it...,"I'm not sure what LinkedIn is going for here. They took a perfectly good app and made it more complicated, harder to navigate with no apparent new features to warrant the wholesale interface changes. This is one of the first apps that I ever wanted to downgrade back a version. I'm not sure what design house convinced them that the LinkedIn community was looking for this monstrosity of a user interface in a mobile app. This should have been field tested with a large cross-section of users before it was released. What a mess. Dump this approach and try again...",1
2011-06-10 00:06:31,No Groups.... Not cool!,"Really, that's the big downfall I see. It looks like a good user interface and I like that you can select a personal 'color friendly' scheme. But to me... The best asset this application could have is exactly what it's missing - groups. 

I get emails all day long from linkedn notifying me of discussions within my groups and it's just a hassle to open my browser to post comment or response. It holds me back in the game. 

For now, I'll give two stars. This represents that I like the layout and how it works and the fact that's it's free... As it should be. Unfortunately, until I see groups... And see groups work well... My rating remains low. I may rate this app with five stars once I can use groups.  Everything else is pretty pointless for me.

1) When you view a profile of someone you want to invite and use the arrow button to attempt to email them or try to send their profile to one of your existing connections you get the same email message. So for either choice you select, email or send a contact you get the exact same message created that says take a look at this profile.

2) It would be nice to be able to view your sent messages & previously sent invitations.

2011-12-09 17:13:45,"Good, but not great","The app gets better with each new update. The new features are certainly welcome but it seems that they are never executed fully.

A few examples: 

1. The new feature that allows you to see who's been viewing your profile gives no indication of the timeframe. Were these people that viewed it in the last day, week, month, year, lifetime? It would be nice to give users the ability to not only know the timeframe but also be able to filter on it.

2. Allow users to update more of their profile info. How difficult is it to add edit screens for the resume section?

3. Allow users to make recommendations and approve/disapprove pending recommendations.",3

2017-08-17 04:46:57,Well...,"I don't really like when app is enforcing me to give away my time and go over an intro of new features without giving me an option to opt out and go directly to the app. I understand what the product team is overly excited to announce new features, but being on the receiving end as a customer it sends a strong message how low opinion they have about users' abilities to learn it without any help.",3
2017-07-07 20:47:18,No more taging,I need to explain my frustration with LinkedIn. I have spent many man Months reading each of the profiles of all my connections and using the TAG function to categorize each one to differentiate how and why I would be contacting them. All my work disappeared overnight with your so call new format. I have looked back into the features of a premium subscription and do not find any thing that has the tag function or can recover any of my painstaking work.,2
2017-05-11 02:27:07,Connection To A New World,LinkedIn in is one of the best if not the best App for connecting to people and groups within your scope of practice. You get to meet like minded people from all over the world offering invaluable information related to your specific industry. It is also for the beginner searching for clear career path.,5
2017-01-29 12:20:22,Getting better With Connecting Professionals,"LinkedIn has definitely improved over the last few years.

I remember when LinkedIn came out, I connected with people who claimed to be professionals and got scammed out of $10,000. 

I swore I would never use LinkedIn again until a friend told me to get back on because they made major changes.

So I gave it one more try (as I always give things 2 chances to anything), I'm glad I did.

My connections have grown and the testimonials section is the best part because it shows others how trustworthy you are.

Great Job on the updates guys!",5
2016-08-12 23:39:45,Solid apps,"No complaints! Seems pretty straightforward. I only open the phone app really when I get a notification, but I love reading all the articles from the companies and news pages I follow. And the students' app that's run with LinkedIn is pretty ok, too. Best thing it does is show me relevant alumni from my university!",5
2017-01-13 22:22:43,"New app spams notifications, too much fluff","The recent updates to the app force you through a bunch of crap trying to get you to invite people and grow your network, which I understand since they need that to make LinkedIn important. It's just annoying with the amount of fake view notifications it sends and how it makes you skip through all these prompts just to use the site, when you can more easily get on your laptop and see the main page. Poor user experience in my opinion.",1
2016-07-06 15:09:49,Unbelievably Great Resource!,"This app has been an incredible resource for me. I have gotten job offers, amazing articles to read, and even cool podcasts/video seminars or conferences relevant to me. I even got a call asking how I liked he conference and asking about my personal dreams and endeavors. That's all with the free version of the app, wow! 5 stars, get this app!",5
2016-07-14 21:37:37,Not good,"I cannot open the app, it crashes whenever I press the linkedin icon to open it. Even before this problem, I disliked several features of this app. Why do I get an app notification to be forced to ""congratulate my friend's birthday or new job""? How is this notification worthy? Show it on website, but do not make it look like I need to get into Linkedin app, some people are expecting important messages through linkedin, and fake notifications like this just make it irritating. At least allow people to opt out.",1
2016-03-03 10:46:59,Excellent professional networking,This works well and keeps me connected with many professionals. Has unique features that separated from other social media sites and focus on the professional skills and abilities. On my wish list: the ability to endorse  contacts for skills from the app.,5
2016-03-04 00:29:09,Data eating update waste!,"Every time the app tries to load the new update, it crashes and starts again from the beginning. Unfortunately, this happened continually this morning while I was away from my phone and not connected to Wi-Fi. By the time I realized and stopped it, the update issues blew through a half gig of my data. Normally I'm pretty patient when it comes to working through bus with new updates, but this is beyond. Never have I experienced such wasteful, lousy performance from a program in my life.",1
2016-02-08 02:57:34,Broken usability,"When I open the LinkedIn app, I want to do one of four things. Send or accept an invite. Reply to a message. Or find out how I am connected to someone or some company. 

On the last point, which makes up my most of my usage, the most recent update ruined the all. There is no easy (or at least discoverable) way to click on a profile and figure out how you know somebody. Just started looking into RelSci—they have a better handle on this.",2
2015-12-11 20:07:58,Terrible Update!!!,This update is a perfect example of negative consequences of not fixing something that is not broken... The new app is so user-unfriendly -- I don't even know where to begin. If main goal was to speed up the search I'm sure they could have done it without redesigning the entire app with such disastrous result. I am definitely not illiterate when it comes to gadgetry and can't even figure out how to endorse someone -- a fairly simple task. This was so unnecessary! Please make this app simple and user-friendly that it once used to be!,1
2015-12-11 16:04:06,You rebels you!,"Obviously, the funny guys at LinkedIn mobile development wanted to show they could mess with the best of us. So, now that they've scrambled things up a bit, in their cute version of Question Authority, I look forward to their imminent return to the other type of QA, so that their mobile apps (at least the iOS and Windows versions) are not so bug-infested that they are effectively useless.  This latest version was a funny example of how to not build and deploy an app. Might have been more inventive too wait until April 1st, though.",1
2015-09-20 12:52:48,Very handy and helpful,"Love the app overall, very user friendly!  Never had a issue with the app until yesterday, on the widget page - it keeps saying ""unable to load.""  I just downloaded the new iOS 9 software, not sure if that has something to do with it.  That would be very nice if that bug/problem could get fixed.

Thanks!",4
2015-11-09 20:05:31,It's alright,"The app is good enough for most purposes, but there are some profile fields you can only adjust from a browser for some reason.  Also, badges don't seem to disappear properly.  Like, you'll see a badge on the app, then go in and read a message, and when you come out the badge doesn't go away unless you go back in and reread the message.  It's annoying but not the end of the world, I guess.",3
2015-05-14 16:03:37,Getting to your connections is not intuitive,"I like the app overall, except for one thing - I always have a problem getting to my connections. The app always pushes you to create the new connections, while for in many cases you need to browse the existing ones. In my opinion it should be one of the easily available options.",4
2015-08-24 06:24:57,Wish i could add Linked In contacts to iPhone Contacts,"Linked In is a very user hostile, unfriendly app. It makes it very difficult to manage and search contact lists. Very difficult to integrate them with your phone contacts. And very little insight unless you buy one of their business plans that always seems to increase in price - was $10/month and now $50/month or more. Fewer and fewer people seem to be using this as Linked In's earnings have been dropping and their business model is chasing away customers.",1
2015-07-16 15:12:22,"Good, but needs beefed up","Updated July 2015: I also agree with other reviewers regarding a need for functionality to block ""anonymous"" viewers, particularly when my profile is set to show my visits openly. Why should anyone have the need to visit anonymously when this is a business-specific social network? This simply shields stalkers from being caught, or others potentially up to no good.
...
The app is attractive and functional, but curiously lacking in some departments: 

First and foremost, I expect to be able to edit my profile using it. Instead, I'm forced to use unfriendly too-large text fields in Safari.

Second, please give me the ability to personalize my message when rewording someone join my network. Thanks.",3
2015-06-25 18:50:39,Supervisor,"LinkedIn is a wicked way to keep up with people in the same field.
I try to learn something new every day. In our line of work it's not all that hard. Using LinkedIn I've heard some pretty awesome safety topics that helped me when I really needed it. I've been a builder for 30 years and love my job. Thanks and be safe",5
2015-05-19 02:52:55,Consistently improved through the last couple of years,This is an updated review. LinkedIn has worked on most of the glitches the app had and it has become the single most important app any professional should be active on.,5
2014-08-04 17:45:02,Know what you're talking about,"Yeah application is a couple of flaws but overall a whole point of LinkedIn is to be a networking system for corporate professionals in that respect this app has done everything that I ever wanted to and deserves four-star rating if you're given a one star rating because the trigger links upgrade to premium, stop complaining",4
2015-04-16 05:02:50,My Review,I don't like it when people are allowed to look at my profile and  be anonymous. What if it is a person I don't want seeing it? That needs to be fixed where they can't use anonymous especially if it could be a person you don't want looking at it. You can't block them if you need to when you don't know who they are. Why are they choosing anonymous to begin with? What do they have to hide? I think the anonymous button needs to be disconnected.,2
2015-02-25 20:49:35,Use Caution:,"The ""See who else you know"" feature uses your device contacts to find potential connections and if you accidentally hit the ""Connect to all"" at the bottom - there is no confirming message. There's no turning back - this is a major flaw with this feature. Use caution - just because they are in your phonebook, doesn't mean they are worthy of a professional network connection.",3
2015-02-11 09:44:34,Extremely Helpful to Connect with Professionals,"LinkedIn is the only solution that gives a social platform for professional 
Although I am using other platforms for socializing but LinkedIn is the only one that I use and recommend to friends for there professional networking",5
2014-10-10 06:52:52,What? No way to update profile,"Seems these folks forgot the first rule of business networking, situations change, data needs to be updated periodically. This app has NO way to update your profile once it is put up. You may as well engrave it in stone, it isn't changing anytime soon.

Great concept for a mobile application for a first rate service, just extremely poor programming decisions. Wait until this problem is worked out before installing this",2
2014-07-17 02:21:48,Good but could be great,"Really nice to have a version of LI on my phone, but there are a few functions missing that would warrant a fifth star.  1. Allow editing of the connection request message to personalize rather than just sending a generic message.
2. Improve search function to enable filtering results by location, company, etc. like web version does.",4
2014-07-17 16:30:53,Still needs improvement,"Although the LinkedIn app has come along way since its initial launch it still has several areas of improvement needed: the chief one being the ability to launch the app from emails and external links that specifically reference LinkedIn content that is viewable on a mobile device often it forces a new login even though you are logged in through the app, Facebook for example has fixed that",2
2013-10-25 17:00:30,"Good but more improvements for Jobs, please","Improvements are great. Would like to see ""who's viewed my profile"" on the app. 

Also in Jobs section both online and in app would be good to have option to say ""this job doesn't interest me"" so that A) it doesn't keep showing up in searches and B) the automated ""you might be interested in"" feed gets smarter.",4
2014-07-15 23:12:50,Worst version yet,"I've been using LinkedIn mobile for several years. This is the first version where it has taken a giant step backward in terms of capabilities. For example, ""People you may know"" has been stuck showing me the same people ever since I updated to this version, presumably to force me to answer yes or no. What if I later know the person?  I answered no to a few, expecting them to be replaced by others, but no, the list just got shorter. Who knows what's going on with this app... Expecting fixes in the next one.",1
2014-04-17 23:41:15,Connect,Linked in offers a professional environment to connect with past and current colleagues. I've found myself referring others helping provide leads and viable candidates as well as accepting great offers from the worlds top companies. I wouldn't use any other professional connection application.,5
2013-02-13 15:27:29,Mediocre,"The website of Linked in is really good and helpful, whereas the app is mediocre:
1. The messages section often shows that I have one message while there is no message when I tap into it. 
2. When editing personal info, especially for skills, I cannot type in skills other than the recommended list. 
3. Searching for jobs has the same issue with updating personal skills.",3
2013-09-30 03:12:47,For looks,"No setting to change text size and lacks functionality. It's great to check on updates, news, groups, and mail but that's about it. However, you need to sign onto a computer to change group settings, sort or search posts, make changes to your profile etc. At least I can read the text on my computer. Mostly, just for looks and frustrating for those that would like to ""use"" it.",2
2013-03-20 23:45:10,Email Buggy,"The email function is terrible.  Often won't send or provides an error message but actually sent.  Can lead to confusion as to whether your contact was actually sent zero, one, or multiple messages.  Very frustrating because you have to draft the email (app does not support landscape mode for typing, only portrait), then copy text, cancel message, re-reply, paste then click send immediately.  This is almost 100% of the time.",2
2016-05-06 20:41:48,Working well for me,"This app works pretty well, though there are a few ui issues that could be improved upon. For example, new connection requests could be better differentiated from suggested connections. I understand that this is probably intentional on LinkedIn's part, to encourage connections, but I find it annoying, as a user.",4
2013-02-09 15:25:50,Horrible,"I use LinkedIn every day online.  I was hoping this app would be a nice compliment to that, but unfortunately it fails.   The only functions that work are accepting connection requests and responding to email. 

Group functions are limited with no ability to manage your group.  Searches are limited and usually inaccurate.  It crashes constantly.  I find myself logging into the web site in my iPod instead of using the app because of its lack of functionality.  

Come on LinkedIn, you can do better than this.",1
2013-01-22 21:53:12,One of the Worst!,"- Edit button missing after update
- ""Send"" button grays out periodically while typing messages (even when there's a title)
- Crashes intermittently
- Navigation sub-par as it relates to groups and liking companies
Overall, this app seems to still be in its beta stages...anxiously awaiting an update that will address these frustrating lacks of features! You're clearly better off just logging in on a computer, which defeats the purpose of a MOBILE app...",2
2012-10-11 03:41:52,Seriously,"Ok, the app is stable, and make sence for the linked in network, but considering it is supposed to be professional, there is some important usability issues with it, one the jumps out to me is the inanity to zoom in and expand the text to be more readable, difficult for hard of seeing, but also bad for tired eyes, which in my opinion, most busy professionals will suffer from regularly. So for the lack of proper care for the users I gave it a lower mark, if this is fixed, ill change it.",2
2012-09-27 19:01:45,Lacks a ton of functionality,I hope in time you can manage everything in linkedin smoothly from this app. Looks like its the same as the mobile site. There are so many small biz companies working with only iOS devices these days it would be wonderful to not need a 'full site' device to do something as menial as updating your job description and looking at your sent messages.,3
2012-01-30 13:44:03,Update needed!,"I really enjoy linked in for many networking abilities, however an iPad app is needed and many of the functions that are available on the web version are not available on app. If the app wants to continue to be successful it needs to evolve. It's like MySpace, Facebook just skipped 10 steps ahead in social networking and left MySpace in the dust. If linked in doesn't evolve something else will.",3
2011-09-02 05:17:37,Newest version is horrendous!!,"I don't know what 21 year old hotshot designer managed to bribe his way into managing this app at linked in, but it is just HORRIBLE.  I mean, linkedin is a professional networking site, and it now looks anything BUT professional!  

The old version was great... Please at least give us the option of reinstalling that one.  I hate this one so much I deleted it off my iPhone altogether, and I used to use the linkedin app all the time.

Take pity on us 30-and-over professionals, and being back something that doesn't look like it should be on MTV.",1
2009-08-31 04:35:07,No functionality - doesn't deserve 1 star,"Take a note from Facebook. Their app has all the latest functionality users are looking for. I will delete this app from my iPhone soon because it is really a waste of space if you think about it. I need all of the same functions I have on the web in the iPhone app. And we need a contact sync function. It only works if a contact is not already in my addressbook. 

In conclusion this app beefs an overhaul. It leaves everything to be desired.",1
2009-05-05 17:16:42,Missing InMail is the main flaw of this app,"I'm excited about the idea of having an app for LinkedIn, but this app is missing some of its most important features, notably InMail and the ability to deal with invitations. The blue nav bar with ""all network updates, status..."" is difficult to scroll left and right, and stands as an odd part of an otherwise decent UI. In a future version, perhaps.",3
2017-09-04 15:16:07,LinkedIn Review,"The best platform across social media allowing me personally, to connect with friends, not necessarily just in my field of expertise, but so many more ideas, stretching across many genres. Kind, intuitive, suggestive. Align today with others. Become part of a media network around the globe.",5
2017-07-23 16:21:35,Please stop trying to force me to connect to every single contact in my phone,Just jumped on to the LInkedIn app to look up someone in my industry who was quoted in a NY Times article. Mis-clicked and accidentally ended up down a rabbit hole of screens during which I may or may not have accidentally invited every contact I've ever had to connect w me on LinkedIn. Even ex-boyfriends. Please. Just. Stop. I've dismissed the request to expand my network hundreds of times in the past. Please quit throwing it on my face over and over again.,1
2017-07-19 05:12:36,Professional Networking,LinkedIn is an outstanding source for professional networking. I'm personally contacted by various head hunters regarding my status in career and colleagues that might be in the market for a change. I've met many great people and companies that I hope to stay in touch with.,5
2017-06-25 18:25:55,Can't use quickly so I end up not using it,"This app is annoying. If I want to look up someone's information or contact them every time I use the app it says ""haven't seen you in a while"" and tries to get me to connect to people I don't want to connect to. Then it has me go through all of these stupid screens before I can actually get to the app. 

Half of the time I close the app before getting to what I am interested in. I'm thinking about deleting it.",2
2017-01-14 02:33:07,Great app!,"I never write reviews on anything but this app is absolutely great to make connections and just get yourself out there. 

If you are looking to market yourself and have a online profesional profile this is the app to get, make sure to add a resume and all your work experiences the more you add the better!",5
2017-01-02 17:39:48,Great tool!,I love this as a professional. I can connect and form networks with people I would normally not come into contact with. There is also a wealth of information shared from articles to books. Market yourself and get connected. Maybe this will help you land the job you are looking for.,5
2016-11-17 13:42:45,Wonderful!,The developers did a great job keeping the professional atmosphere of the browser version on this app. I like it better in many ways than using LinkedIn on my computer. It's a great way to stay connected to my business contacts all over the globe.,5
2016-11-07 17:26:21,Yeah,LinkedIn is awesome and constantly getting better. I was invited to join by a co-worker that was leaving and it was a great way to stay in touch with co-workers that I care so much for and did not know if I would see again. The work place has changed but LinkedIn has given coworkers a chance to stay friends,5
2016-05-10 19:06:50,Build your brand & make invaluable connections,"Simple put, LinkedIn is an awesome tool to further your career, start/grow your business, meet the right person to launch/grow/sell to, OR you could waste your time looking at other people, worrying about comparing to them. Either way, it's cool :).",5
2016-04-25 23:05:48,Changed my life... Literally,"LinkedIn was the reason I remained connected with my boss of 10 years ago, when she contacted me for the best job opportunity I could have dreamed of. Two years later, I still tell the story and recommend that every professional has an account.",5
2016-02-24 19:46:39,Useful but app is so annoying,"I like LinkedIn in principle but I find the app infuriating; it's cluttered, counter-intuitive, and not helpful. It's impossible to find the settings and to edit the (useless) notifications that it takes the liberty of sending you. I don't understand who uses the news feed feature enough to want it all over the all when you can hardly navigate to accept an invitation to connect. Needs a lot of refining work in my opinion.",2
2015-07-31 15:39:44,Useful,"I find the application to be more of a glorified Facebook which seems to be weighted on finding employment or asking others to endorse someone for skill sets that most friends or acquaintances are not aware of. I originally thought it was for professionals to network. A ""contact file"" of sorts but as I said, just another Facebook, My Space or what ever you want to call it.",4
2016-01-21 00:03:19,Great place to Network,"After two years of hearing about LinkedIn I thought why not make one. My networking has increase. So has my pay, I even get job offers. It's a must if you a mental health professional. Plus the people on LinkedIn keep you motivated and informed of your current field.",5
2016-01-14 23:18:56,Bring back LinkedIn Calendar!,"I have no way of easily researching and connecting with or researching attendees of any specific meeting ahead of time or after the fact - now that the calendar feature is gone.  This was the most important, useful feature that has been removed.  For a meeting of 20 people I now need to manually search each attendee individually.  Please bring back the calendar!  The ""connected"" app does not solve this problem either.",2
2016-01-11 05:38:55,Horrible Update & Redesign!! Can't even use the app,I rarely write reviews but felt compelled to leave feedback regarding the update and redesign of this app. If I could give it zero stars I would. It's a complete mess that doesn't even work let alone the horrible redesign which looks like it was done on win 95 I kid you not. Really upsetting because before this update I was a linkedin mobile power user and now I only log in from the web. Please for the love of god listen to your customers feedback and change it back and fix the app!!,1
2015-12-19 02:29:34,New app and update still poor,"Really see no difference with the update.  This is no longer a professional network app.  It is quickly becoming a grown ups facebook.  Sad.  Was such a useful professional tool and there are now to many things wrong to list.  How can you not have a search on the connections section?  Connections, at one time, was the purpose of this app.  I am taking it off my phone and Ipad and will be using the website only.  Jeff, it is time to pay attention to these ratings please.",1
2015-12-07 19:22:38,Bring back Landscape View,"To begin:  please bring back Landscape View.  I often use my iPad with a keyboard and it is very annoying that not only LI does not have Landscape, it forces portrait view on other apps until the iPad realizes I am in Landscape mode.

That being said, unlike a lot of others, I don't dislike the updates.  Requires a little hunting to find functionality you regularly used since the UI/UX is completely different.

Please bring Landscape View back.",2
2015-12-04 05:35:53,Message searching feature is gone,"The new interface looks good. However it made one of the most important features disappeared which is the feature to search in messages. Why do you disable this very useful feature from previous version??? Now I have to scroll though to try to find the messages that I sent.  So frustrated. Please fix it. 

Thanks",3
2015-11-16 04:02:38,Birthdays of Strangers?,"Random people I am somehow connected to through LinkedIn have their birthday showing up in my personal on my phone calendar. I am not even able to delete this. I cannot explain how frustrating and invasive this feels. 
Unfortunately, I will now be deleting my entire LinkedIn account because of this problem. I am disappointed because I thought LinkedIn was intended to be a far less intrusive way of connecting professionally.",2
2015-09-23 20:57:15,See who you know on LinkedIn.,"App is a great way to build your network. However after the recent update it asks me to sync contacts every time I open the app. Even if I just switched to a different screen and came back to the app. It's a bit annoying. How do I get this to stop? I already tried giving access to my contacts but it still asks to ""See who else you know on LinkedIn.""",3

2015-04-12 14:32:50,Good way for networking,"From all the social media I think this is a good way to start networking, find a job and meet new people.

The only thing is that in order to have more access to your profile you need to pay a monthly fee which I think is good if your looking for a job but if you only need this to do networking I think it should be free...",4
2015-07-27 22:13:26,Keeps me in touch and informed,"I use LinkedIn all the time- I can see where people are going and when they are looking for a job.

I am always looking for talent and I've found a few good folks on LinkedIn.

There are a few groups that I always check on as well- good customer contact.",5
2015-01-02 02:36:49,Management Trainee,"It is a great app to have. It allows you to stay linked to your network, follow various leaders and their posts, helps you to stay updated in whatever the field you are interested in through various articles and so forth. 
I love almost everything about LinkedIn. Although I do not like the endorsement part on your profile.",4
2015-02-09 23:08:57,Love LinkedIn...app is awful,"Sharing articles within the app is extremely difficult. See an article a contact posted. Open article within the app. Use social media buttons at the top of the article to share.  
Twitter - cannot place cursor in pre-drafted text to edit.
LinkedIn - While typing a comment to be published with the article the app constantly suggests companies and people to tag making it impossible to type. Try to do this on the iphone and you will end up hitting the post button every time. When you select to share with LinkedIn and Twitter the app takes you to Twitter to authorize and then will not load/redirect back to LinkedIn. Yes, I restarted app, updated app and restarted iPad.
I gave up after trying to share on additional social media platforms within the LinkedIn app. 

Please fix this. Thank you!",1
2014-01-22 05:26:12,No sharing with groups,"I like the iPad version of the Linkedin app., but one suggestion I have is to have the ability to share an article to a group. You have options for LinkedIn...LinkedIn + twitter...and connections! but nothing for groups. That should definitely be an option. Trying to share articles manually is a MAJOR pain.",4
2014-09-05 11:18:30,Good but not great,I would give 3.5 stars if i could get half stars. This app is decent and does most of what it should but it is still limited. Of course all apps are limited in terms of the full fledged website but there should be features available on this app that just aren't here. It's too difficult to search through your mailbox and invitations. Profiles are limited. Hopefully more updates come soon.,3
2014-08-25 14:47:50,Use it every day,Learning how to sell yourself is the most important lesson of your career. This is a critical and necessary tool in achieving that. The rule of thumb in marketing is that you spend 20% on content and 80% on delivery. This is leverage in that respect. It's worth the investment of time in yourself to complete and work on your profile and contact list.,5
2014-08-05 18:37:26,Why use anything else?,This truly is my favorite social business app. LinkedIn is user friendly and content relevant. I use this app for making business connections as well as sustaining / communicating with my connections.  I'm a power user for sure and appreciate the product's robust features.,5
2014-03-30 00:56:49,Log in?!,"I'd really like to actually be able to utilize this app; however, I cannot due to the consistent error I keep encountering. I am forever having to change my password. Even then I am still unable to log in to my account! I literally change the password, then it says I have successfully changed it and I can now log in, yet when I go to log in it STILL tells me my password is incorrect! So done with this thing! I shall keep it around a little while longer only in the hopes it may be resolved soon. REALLY SOON!",1
2014-03-05 15:33:11,Keeps connections,"Just got this app after completing my full profile. 
Already enjoy knowing who I know in the professional workplace without having to write it all down. Easy to use and I can also edit everything right on their if I need to update it on the run.",5
2013-06-28 01:47:27,Networking On The Go,Since I'm always connecting with people through LinkedIn it's great to have this app handy when I meet a new contact. I can send them a request to connect while I'm out in the field working. Unfortunately a lot of LinkedIn's best features are not available on the mobile version. If it weren't for that small flaw I'd give it 5 stars.,4
2013-09-11 10:31:24,Not launching after original install!,"I used the app to stay in touch with who visited my profile and such, but since latest update it is immpossible to launch the app after the 1-st intall and login. It shows the loadscreen, the quits to ""desktop"" (homescreen). I know that you dont guarantee it will work on older devices or outdated firmwares, but i really like staying on IOS 5.1.3 on my iPhone 4. Could you please look into this issue. Thank you!",3
2013-09-09 13:19:47,User Friendly,"Apps are often plagued with glitches that make them less appealing than working from a desk top. LinkedIn does not have that issue--the app is well-designed and easy to use, and continues to improve with each update.  Thank you for keeping us all linked!",5
2013-04-19 10:39:17,I've made important contacts,LinkedIn has been one of the most important apps I use to make business connections.  I've had the ability to find key people with business skills my company needs and they are essentially referred by my close business friends and partners.   A fast way to reach people I would have never known to call.,4
2013-05-09 20:39:43,Upsetting,"New interface is nice...
BUT, push notifications simply don't work. Only when i open the app will it then notify me that i have messages or notifications. There is a constant reloading issue you will encounter when scrolling to the bottom of the app on the invitations page. Also, when viewing followed companies, they will be shown in alphabetical order, but not all loaded, so you scroll to the 'Z's and then more companies load starting at 'A' again.",2
2012-07-14 17:05:31,Good but does not intercept links,The app is good overall. However I am disappointed by integration with Safari: when I open a linkedin link from email (they send periodic job listings) it does not open it in app but rather redirect to the website where it proposes either to use mobile version of the site or install the app which I already have.,4
2012-12-12 00:41:53,Lousy app,"This is an all but worthless app. I gave it two stars instead of one because WHEN it lets me in (without signing in every time), it's at least as user-friendly as the Web site, which I'd also rank at two stars. More and more, LinkedIn seems to try really hard at lip-service (join this group! Link in to networking opportunities here!) but little else. The entire company seems to need some real vision. There is so much potential but it lacks in every way.",2
2012-10-22 18:17:56,Makes the connect,The point of this app is to connect with friends and colleagues in the workplace. It does this with ease while also showing you updates and links that can help you improve your connections and the way you do business. A+ in my book.,5
2010-11-11 22:20:11,Like this app; needs some changes,"I like this app but the frustrating part is when you download your contacts to your phone's contacts, it duplicates entries even when the persons name is spelled the same on your phone and on the persons linkedin profile. Please provide update to combine the contacts. Thanks",4
2011-12-26 16:53:29,It's getting better...,"It's good to keep seeing all the improvements.  2 feature requests:  let me turn off tweets in the update stream (especially if I already follow them on twitter) - and when I send a connection request from ""people you might know,"" let me customize it. 

keep it up!",5
2017-05-10 00:31:53,Still the go-to for my professional network,"While LinkedIn seems to be driving over some bumps and holes in the road, post Microsoft acquisition and recent multiple UI changes, it is still my go-to for connecting with a network of individuals, groups, companies, and information relevant to my career and professional interests and growth.",4
2017-09-07 20:43:28,Business app of the past is app of the future,"Yes LinkedIn is still here and still the best, most dominant business networking, recruiting and job search platform. 

People ask me all the time how they can level up their life or career and I tell them the number one thing is to take LinkedIn seriously. 

Commit to using LinkedIn the same way you do Facebook or Instagram or Snapchat or whatever your favorite app is: USE IT EVERYDAY. 

Make it part of your daily routine and you will see a 10x return!!!!

This social network isn't going anywhere except for up... always growing and improving.",5
2017-07-12 23:11:20,app works fine. notifications are the worst.,"The app works very well. we can see our timeline, chat with our contacts etc. 
but why are we unable to disable the annoying birthdays and publications we didn't ask for? every day 3 or 4 notifications that I didn't want to see pops up. 
of course I can disable all notifications but I might loose some recruiters messages in the chat. 
anyway waiting forever for this opinions.",2
2017-06-08 00:36:22,Quite some utility in here,Even without the premium features the app provides plenty of utility. Premium let's you do some cool things additionally but is not necessary to have a professional website of yourself online. Make sure to go into settings and define a specially homepage link for yourself.,5
2017-04-14 04:06:27,Essential Tool and great resource,"If you current work in any industry at a professional level, plan on a career as a professional of some kind. This app is a must have to legitimize your network, advertise yourself to re recruiters as well as research other companies. The list goes on I have benefited from it greatly.",5
2017-02-02 10:52:13,Excellent in Every Aspect!,"I have been a member of this community for a long while now and have experienced how this application and its features have improved throughout the years.  It is an absolute ""must have"" for professionals.  Networking and education are key features and analytics is just icing on the cake!",5
2017-02-13 01:31:58,Stop giving me pointless notifications,LinkedIn is a wonderful app that provides employees of any industry  an opportunity to meet and to connect with others. Here's my issue: I don't care when their birthdays are nor do I want to be reminded to wish them a happy work anniversary. For Christ sake at least give me the option to turn these pointless notifications off. It's annoying and pointless.,3
2016-10-23 12:27:37,Networking at its best!,"As a young professional looking for career and business networking opportunities, I have found LinkedIn to be very fulfilling. I use most, if not all the tools that the App provides. I particular enjoy sharing thoughts and ideas with my 500 plus network of professionals. LinkedIn is truly networking at it's best!",5
2016-10-15 18:46:29,Useless!!,"I am a LinkedIn user since the first year LinkedIn started.

IMHO the LinkedIn mobile app is completely useless

It can not achieve the most basic task: to show a person's full LinkedIn profile!

The aggregated info which is shown instead is completely useless

It looks like LinkedIn has lost their way - trying to be like Facebook - not sticking to their core value prop

I am very irritated that they make it impossible to look at a person's full profile. Showing the same content which is available on their full web site -- how difficult could that be??",5
2016-05-13 13:33:23,Consultant,"Excellent App. I use it every day!

Recommendation: Allows users to send a personalized message when connecting with others. I personally ignore connection requests whenever I see a generic message, but if the member was able to express why they wanted to connect, I'd be more inclined to accept their request.",5
2016-02-19 13:05:45,Good but not awesome.,"You've have progressed for the good and continually get better. Quit forcing features that I still say ""Not Now"". I get it ""Not Now"" maybe later is why they keep forcing us to try different things within your app. Stop. I'd also like to ""Share"" posts with certain individuals in my Network. Keep up the good work. Until next time.",4
2016-04-27 00:22:51,Bravo!,"This app is simple to use from a mobile device, and the messaging features and reminders are great for keeping in touch and congratulating colleagues. There is no better tool for professional networking if you use LinkedIn consistently. The app makes it easy. Thank you",5
2015-09-01 16:34:07,I use this app all the time,"The app is great, however, I would like some improvements. There is a big where I cannot see messages through the app. I also wish there was a sales navigator app that I could use when I'm on my phone. Better search tools as well especially for location where you have to use metro areas.",4
2016-02-18 19:51:47,Love LinkedIn but the App leaves a lot to be desired,"Much less functionality than the web interface.  Many times you will wish you just opened it up in Safari so you can do the things you want, like manage your groups and approve new members.  Or just like someone's career change rather than posting a message to them.  FB app is at least 25% better- so take a clue LinkedIn, 3 stars.",3
2016-01-26 12:11:31,You broke it!,"For the longest time this was my go-to app. It had its flaws with instability, bugs and some missing features like post editing, no ability to remove/block/report a contact but for the most part it worked great.

One of the things I loved was that I could instantly check if I had new messages, or new contacts. It worked relatively the same way the website does, which I also liked. It was good enough for me, to keep my premium account going, even when I strictly didn't need it. 

After the latest update I think I'm pretty much done with it. It has lost any use it had for me. Not keeping premium going either. To use it effectively you would need a usable app.

1 star, because it starts and runs; but has no use anymore.",2
2016-01-09 19:21:25,New Version Frustration,"The new version of the app is really lacking in functionality. I have no way to see what companies and people I am following. So, if I know there's a particular company I want to check on, but can't remember the name, I'm stranded. It's also difficult to find info about people you're linked to. Rather, it wants to show me other people that were searched for. But,I'm looking at this person's profile for a reason, to find content related to that person. This version is really a let down.",1
2016-01-05 18:00:09,How could you not fix this?!?,"I, like so many others who have commented, have been completely frustrated that the LinkedIn app no longer allows users to view it in landscape orientation. This has been noted by numerous people so the developers must be well aware of the problem. I just downloaded the latest update and was optimist to see that it was supposed to fix several bug issues. But nope, STILL NO LANDSCAPE ORIENTATION. Are you kidding me? Dumping the app today. Being unresponsive to customer complaints is completely unacceptable.",1
2015-12-05 22:28:46,Regression not Progression,"A poorly designed update, please offer the3 older version again as an option or go back.  The fact that on a tablet or iPad there is no landscape option should be enough to support the fact that this is a failed launch (supported by other reviewers).  Many more professionals are using tablets not laptops...and flipping back and forth between apps...this now looks like a 10 year old phone app that has never been updated.  Its not attractive and becomes less useful. Fix it, please.",1
2015-12-04 06:02:09,Ripping Facebooks UI,"Used this app for less than a day and I'm already frustrated with it. This app is a step backward on many levels. It appears they have copied Facebooks UI and layout but this fails even to match FB's versatility. That said, I really liked the previous version of this app.
Shortcomings of this update:
- locked in portrait mode--who thought this was a good idea?
- features that used to be fluid and intuitive are now buried under layers of eye candy or buttons
- some features completely taken away (features in settings)

That said the information presented in the app newsfeed and profiles is much more clean and appealing, LinkedIn just completely missed the boat on trying to streamline the user experience too much, took away way too many features and in doing this made the app unusable in many respects.",1
2015-06-18 18:32:27,Extremely Valuable,This app has functionality that allows me to sync and maintain updated information automatically for all of my connections and contacts. Having that information updated automatically saves me a lot of time and enables me to work on things that are pertinent to running my business,4
2015-07-29 23:18:57,The best way to connect,"For the working community this represent the best way to be in contact to the people that move the nation, well at list with a great representation of the working class. Share info, experiences and knowledge allowed us the learn and grow into the future together. Keep the program for the benefit of all together.",5
2015-05-11 14:02:43,Post Support,I love everything about LINKEDIN. I swear by it as I have received great job offerings through diligent searching and building my profile. One aspect of the mobile application that I wish was more functional would be the post function. Even from my Galaxy Tab S I cannot successfully post the same way I would like to from a desktop,4
2015-03-04 16:09:27,LinkedIn,"I enjoy LinkedIn for the ability to stay connected to all my contacts. Especially, when they chose to move to another company. LinkedIn has kept this site updated with their newest app. Works quickly to fix any issue related to applications and new phones and technology. Get business application.",4
2015-03-05 19:36:01,What can I say? It works!,I've been with LinkedIn for about a year. Over that time I have made a lot of connections and am now in the business I'm in right now and I love it!  But it doesn't stop there. I continue to use it for information and keep in touch with all my connections still.,5
2014-09-03 00:33:07,"No complaints, mostly","LinkedIn is obviously great, an incredible useful service. The app itself doesn't quite have the functionality of the website, and is definitely a pain to navigate sometimes. I think that it just takes a little while to figure out where everything is.",4
2014-12-18 05:03:43,Can't Personalize Invite Messages,"Personally, I am generally pleased with the LinkedIn app. It is great to use on the go, and keep up with yours and others' profiles when you need something quick. 

The one thing I've noticed so far that I wish was different is the ability to customize messages when you invite people to connect through the app. That would be a huge, huge plus.",3
2014-10-13 04:44:45,Lots of bugs,"""Who's viewed you"" never loads now. Timeline shows me new connections that people don't really have. Not sure if this is a bug or some kind of trick Linked In is pulling to try to make my timeline look more active than it really is, but now I just don't trust it.  Also, this is more about the email notifications than the app itself, but you can't actually see the whole width of the conversation in email, so you have to launch the app to read messages. I find that super frustrating.

Please hire some testers.",1
2014-10-01 12:22:33,Good stuff,"I've gotten Job after Job offer since I created an account. If you understand social media and analytics you will benefit from this platform. For those who aren't getting the most out of it, check out the examples provided by LinkedIn and excel your profile interest stats.",5
2014-08-21 01:34:25,Seriously buggy,This app works well enough but it needs a pretty good overhaul. There are some serious bugs when scrolling through feeds that it will flicker and the user can't select anything. And certain menus and navigation just doesn't quite seem to make sense. I hope they release a stable update soon. But for now I will stick to doing my Linkedin business on the computer.,3
2013-09-26 21:54:45,Forget following discussion comments with this app,"I am very disappointed that the app fails to properly display all the comments in a discussion, leading to confusion amongst a group. Also I hate when a comment I write just disappears without a trace. I do all my social media-ing on my phone. Who has time to log in on a browser to see everything LinkedIn has for me? The sleek look of my feed warrants the two stars, but this would be a 4 star app if the freaking commenting worked properly.",2
2011-10-20 00:06:37,I like it :),"It's much better and more stable than the previous version, before the redesign.  I prefer to edit my profile from the computer, so not having this feature isn't a deal breaker.

However, would like to see stats in here and a way to preview user's profiles updates without actually visiting their profile.  Thanks.",4
2013-09-13 15:44:28,mediocre,"The app is not only limited by its functionality in that updates, mail, and so on has to be read/performed on the website instead of through the app, it also has profile errors in at least one instance.  On the website, I updated my blog that was formerly hosted by Blogger but is now on Wordpress to reflect the new URL, which it does just find on LI's website.  In the app, the old URL still shows.  So, limited features plus bugs of this nature are totally unacceptable. I'd give it a -2 stars if it were possible.",1
2013-09-09 00:34:54,Could be so much more,"With the app in three parts only one works well enough to be considered special and it's the new feed.  Finding contacts, links, and looking at an adjusting your profile is a less than stellar experience.  Needs a serious revamp.  Perhaps version 3 will hit all the marks.",5
2013-09-05 18:49:09,"Decent, but...","It's so, so glitchy. They never fix the issue where you choose a news story, but in between the time of your pressing the story, and the display responding to your choice, the app updates and your story that you originally wanted to read is now gone. Really frustrating.
Also, it's actually difficult to find connections in here. They need to use a different Boolean architecture or algorithm that better directs you to where you would like to go.",2
2013-05-15 21:22:55,Still subpar,"This app manages to remain the least intuitive and useful of the major social media apps.
It's improving, but only slowly.
One example- I tried to add new experience, filled in all fields, but it said that I left out required field. It gave no indication which ones (and all were filled in) so I basically gave up.

Would have been fine 3-4 years ago... Not acceptable at this point in the app-store life cycle",3
2013-02-21 04:26:55,Used to be better...,"The LinkedIn mobile app used to work perfectly.  Now lots of times I can't load my own profile or see who has viewed my profile or sent me email - when I click on those notifications, the screen just goes black.  Please FIX!!!!  I've deleted and reloaded the app multiple times but nothing's worked.  Could this be related to new Apple iOS 6.0 operating system for iPhones?  Not having any problems with other apps I use.....",2
2012-04-29 01:35:07,Website is better,"The app interface is certainly nicer but it lacks much of the functionality that the website provides. Key things such as in-mail, advanced profile search filters, and saving profiles to your premium LinkedIn account are not available in the app. A nice simplified version, but needs much improvement to be an equal to the website experience.",3
2012-04-28 14:37:07,Not intuitive at all,"Having been a long time user of the previous LinkedIn app, I have to say that this new version, while being something that we iPad users have been previously left out, this one is not intuitive on how to use at all. I am completely lost. Also, In the older version I could enlarge the photos in profiles. Now I can't.  So far, I have not found myself embracing this 'iPad' update.",3
2012-03-13 00:33:16,Overall good app,"Nothing to die for.  The app does what is says but the user interface (how you interact with the app) is kind of confusing to me.  I can't see my connections right away and I need to navigate to get there.  The people you may know does not rotate so I always see the same people first.  The ""push"" notifications do not really push until you open the app.",3
2012-03-03 20:02:13,Good app but.....,"I like the professional layout of the app but I can't edit my profile. That makes the functionality of the app almost useless unless you are checking profiles or updating your status. Please add the ability to edit the profile! Yes I could do this from a computer, but I'd like to have the same options of the full website.",3
2012-02-29 07:00:39,Bug,"After I search for people, type the key word, I look at some of their profile, then I hit go back (all the way), and I was stuck in the list of searched people and I can't go anywhere.  Hope LinkedIn can fix this bug",5
2011-12-03 04:27:23,"Good, but potential to be great app...","3 stars for a solid, reliable app that has a rich UI, easy to use interface, and great use of space. 

Doesn't get 4 or 5 stars because of the same issues or lack of features others dinged it on; no editable profile or mobile jobs. Would also like to see better use of iOS5 features like alerts, etc. 

Great update, look forward to seeing the next rev with all that IPO funding :)",3
2011-11-11 19:43:42,Not practical for mobile users,"App is ok, offers basic features but I really wish it did more. I dislike you can't edit your profile through the app or though the mobile site and what's even worse is there is no option on the homepage of the mobile site to visit the HTML site. Very impractical for people that mainly use their phones to connect. I know I can do it on my computer but I spend much more time on my phone than on the computer.",2
2008-08-21 19:25:53,Good first step,"Looks great and works well.  Only complaint is that there seems to be no way to get to one's inbox. I must admit that keeping up on social networking has been a relatively low priority for me. But if I could handle a few inbox requests while I'm waiting somewhere, that would significantly decrease my response time.",4
2017-08-12 21:34:53,Use this almost daily,"Being a big networker and staying in touch with many different industries I found that this app is super helpful! It's easy to search for other professionals, looks at companies, see some jobs, and see the latest industry news.",5
2017-08-04 01:41:57,Love it 👌🏼,"It's like Facebook but just for the professionals. Love the Daily Rundown! Always keeps me up to date and sharp when carrying conversations with coworkers and patients. Kind of wish it would show me more people who I have a lot of connections with vs. people with one or no connections to me. Otherwise, love it! 👌🏼",5
2017-04-21 11:17:26,Amazing!,Fantastic!  Keep building up the great job features.  Love the ability for recruiters to discretely understand you are looking for new & exiting opportunities!  More options for this feature would be advantageous for those looking to move up or change paths in this world! Thank you :),5
2016-08-18 19:21:55,Gives appropriate guidance for maintaining professional relationships,This app has recently been quite instrumental in helping me maintain my professional relationships better. It shows you when to reach out and gives you an example of what to say. I use LinkedIn now more than ever.,5
2016-08-22 18:54:14,Deceptive Tactics,This app will occasionally force you to go through a setup process of sorts even after you have set up the app. The deceptive part is they try to make it look like others have asked for you to connect when in reality you will be initiating the first request. This makes for a very poor user experience and deceptive behavior never makes me feel comfortable when trusting an app/company.,3
2016-07-10 04:42:51,The Biggest MMO game ever.,"I am awed at the scope of this game. Gameplay is super complex. Only some of your friends will really understand how to play. It is sometimes slow and could use more coin bonuses when leveling up, but otherwise decent. If you like Game of Thrones, LinkedIn is the mobile game you've been looking for.",5
2014-07-10 15:20:38,Buggy new release,"New release has a formatting bug in the Comment box. It's a text-wrapping error. If you try and type a comment longer than about 7 or 8 words the comments go off the right side of the visible screen and it's impossible to view your comments before posting - typing in the dark, as it were.",4
2016-06-19 20:58:24,Great!,"The app makes it easy and convenient to stay connected via LinkedIn. It doesn't do quite everything the website version does, mostly account settings, etc. That said, I use the app 99% of the time. It's efficient, streamlined & pretty flawless in my experience.",5
2016-05-26 11:12:58,A great resource,"LinkdIn is a great resource for anyone who is in business wanting to connect with others, to find out what the latest trends are or to find a job. The app is easy to use and free. You have the option to unlock additional features which of course will cost you.",5
2016-05-25 20:09:03,Great for Networking,"When starting out in your career, you never knew where to go, until there was LinkedIn. I absolutely love this app, it's convenient for finding colleagues in other areas, creating business leads, and recruiting talent. I use it for s variety of reasons, and it's part of my everyday routine.",5
2016-05-23 20:56:54,Notification help,"I wish there was a way to see within the app who has accepted my fried requests. I get a notification badge when my phone is locked, but if I don't remember what the badge said then I can't track who has responded to my requests. It's easy to find on a pc, but I wish it worked on the app too. This review would for sure be a 5 star if this one little thing was resolved. Thanks!!",3
2016-05-23 04:17:41,Easy to use,"This LinkedIn app is very easy to use, very self explanatory and very useful. I would rather use the LinkedIn on my phone through the app than through the web portal. The notifications are also very useful if you are not always checking your apps.",5
2016-05-03 02:13:51,Great update,The new update combined with all the new stand alone applications makes the mobile  LinkedIn experience one that you can truly enjoy. I am happy where they have been able to take the mobile platform and look forward to its continued development.,5
2016-03-24 15:41:33,Amazing Job Search Tool,"If you are looking for a better job, or just searching for others in your field to share information this is the must have app. It takes time to grow your network so if your someone who expects instant results then get a dating app.",5
2016-02-11 13:57:03,When it ain't Broke- Don't try to fix it!,"Horrible update. It was great before the last update, it doesn't take in your info from profile, constantly asks if you want to add people without giving access to the contacts you have. It gets STUCK, and keeps showing the same feed of news, without updating. It's So Awful, I deleted it of my iPhone, and will use my desktop computer to access LinkedIn only. NOW- would be a Good time to FIX IT Please!! I won't reinstall the app until it's fixed!! :(",1
2015-12-11 01:26:45,DESERVES ZERO STARS!!!,"Is today April 1st? Because only a fool would find this update useful. First, it only supports portrait mode on my iPad? What!?! Yes, it's true. I can just see the LinkedIn pre-release meeting... 
DEV: ""Hey, Boss, look, I got the new update to work in portrait mode only.""
CEO: ""But don't iPad users operate in landscape mode 90% of the time?""
DEV: ""Hmmm...I don't know; I don't own an iPad.""
CEO: ""Yeah, me neither. But we need to meet our deadline, so don't sweat the small stuff. Just get it out there. I'm sure our loyal users will love it. After, we have no competition, so what else are they are gonna use?""",1
2015-12-09 12:04:46,The new version is bad,"I was very much happy with the old version...the new version although looks cool, it does not work... Often time when I try to view someone's profile I don't see their info, the app ""thinks"" and after a while I get an error message ""something went wrong, try again"" ... It's definitely not my internet connection so I hope someone at linked reads all these negative feedbacks about the update and does something about it. The App simply isn't as user friendly as it used to be.",1
2015-12-03 19:42:44,Poor Redesign,"Dec 2015 update is EVEN WORSE! I got an invitation to connect and I went to the app and could not find the invite. Please listen to your users!!!

This app in previous versions was lacking basic functionality, but at least the main window showed everything at a glance. Now everything is buried at least one level down making this app less useful. They obviously wanted to spice up the interface, make it a little more sexy...but at a cost of utility. Fire the head designer. Try again!",1
2015-11-26 17:45:08,Does the LinkedIn exec team use this app?,"Because this app is almost unusable. The UX is horrible. To get back to the main menu after accepting a few connecting, you have to hit back several times beefier you can even get back to the home menu. Groups, bad on this app. Viewing shared connect, bad on this app. Sometimes you can share content, sometimes you can't.  Plus, Facebook updates their so every two weeks... We are lucky if LinkedIn updates every three months. Come on LinkedIn, get it together.",1
2015-10-02 17:02:29,Great Industry Connector !,I have been using LinkedIn to keep up to date on my industries news and have found it an easy way of connecting and socializing with great groups of people! The simplicity and sleek functionality of the app makes it easier to check and go on a busy day.,5
2015-09-09 00:14:19,Can't update or change any of your information,"You have to log in via a computer to do literally anything. Worthless app. When you do log in via a desktop, the desktop version proves to be just as clunky and glitchy. Losing information. Never properly loading pages. Constantly just not saving information added to your account. I was looking for a professional social site to share business contacts and information and this is by far not it.",1
2015-06-23 13:58:48,On the GO!,Who seriously uses the app to update their profile? I love it because I can quickly go through my notifications and add new contacts on the go. Never had any difficulty using the app or crashes/lost data. Hopefully now the app will stop asking me to rate it...,5
2015-05-12 03:06:56,Terrible search engine,I downloaded this app since it was difficult to search for jobs near my area using the mobile browser.  This app is just as bad as the mobile site. You can't search for specific administrative jobs near a specific area and then some window pops up to try their new job search app.. Really I thought I was already on a job searching app. Why should users have to download two separate apps to efficiently search for jobs? This why we visited LinkedIn in the first place.,1
2014-09-25 12:13:11,It's a Little Buggy,"I'm happy with the changes of since my last rating of the app. But there's some minor bugs that should be addressed: 1) when you open mail it doesn't like to open at command 2) accepting a new connection    ...let's say I just log into the website to do that. 

Those are my biggest complaints....however proceed on with the wonderful work LinkedIn has been sharing!",3
2014-06-29 11:14:51,Easy access to most functions,"The app (iPhone and iPad) is not fully functional compared with the website. It does give quick access to email, connecting to new contacts, and viewing profiles--the tasks you're more likely to need on the go.",5
2014-05-27 17:37:44,"I Feel Connected, So LinkedIn!","This app is awesome. It puts all other similar one's to shame as it is the best. LinkedIn has the cred to keep you in contact with those you need, when you need them. It's a huge asset when job searching, or just reconnecting with a close buddy you may have lost touch with!
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5
2014-04-28 13:12:43,Pretty Good,"The app for my iPhone is pretty good. I like that it shows you have messages or requests. There are still too many steps to do simple things & you can't fully use the site without going through your laptop. However, to retrieve quick messages or new job postings on the go, the app is pretty good considering I am using it on my phone.",4
2014-02-13 04:56:51,Better but still needs work,"This upgrade is much better than before but I think it still needs to evolve a little more. The actual website is great but I wish that the app had more functions that the website has like editing your profile. If this could be done, it would be perfect!",4
2014-04-05 04:31:32,Never log in.  Kmpossible,You can't even log in.  You reset your password in the browser.  You click the link. It tells you it's successful.  You try to log in the app.  It asks if you've forgotten your password    If you say No it gives you an image of two words.  You type them in.  If you're wrong you get another chance.  If you're right it goes back to ask you if you forgot your password.  If you say yes this time it sends you to the screen to reset your password and there's never a way to log in.  AWFUL,1
2014-04-04 07:04:15,Do not download contacts,"I tried downloading my Linkedin contacts hoping that it will match the names and fill all other blank fields. But it tries to match email addresses, so if you do not have the email address of one of your contacts on your phone, you'll end up with duplicate entries in your phonebook. So now I have many many duplicate entries in my phonebook which us extremely annoying.",3
2014-03-26 15:19:55,Great improvements,"LinkedIn has improved exponentially over the past several years. The app lets me interact easily with my network, and I love the discussion notifications that help me stay in the conversation while on the go. This app is far better than the Facebook mobile app!",5
2013-05-04 15:12:11,Finally I good app design!,"The old app used to be ugly and unusable. This is a great improvement! Design is very neat and sleek, it's easy and intuitive to move around, and it's much more stable and reliable. Because of that, I check it almost every day now. Well done guys! One thing missing though - add locations to jobs please. It's really not difficult. Then I'll rate it 5 stars",4
2014-02-07 16:34:57,"Love It, Use it Hourly","I love this app and use it almost every hour of the day.  It keeps getting better and better, my one big request right now is being able to see sent messages from the mobile app (don't know why this isn't supported, seems easy enough).",5
2013-09-06 07:44:05,Great App,"Allows you to have access to most of the desktop application with all the news feeds and other customized data feeds.  Includes ability to see who has viewed your profile, search, news feeds, and other standard features.",5
2013-06-21 12:48:03,Improving,"This latest version has gotten a lot more user friendly. Still, though, there are some annoying issues you wouldn't expect from such a large company. Even w/ a solid Internet connection, often times I get the ""Oops.  We can't pull this page"" message. In other cases, there's missing capability for no reason (e.g., how do I search for a group or company the same way I do a person?).",3
2013-06-17 13:56:37,Curator,"REVIEW FOR OLD APP BELOW: 
1.) Please drop the over-zealous use of skeuomorphism, it detracts from the functionality, especially with so little screen real estate.
2.) good grief, please the the address-book feature you've had in beta for over two years and add it to you mobile version — you have users do all this manual data-entry, then you don't let us access any of it, you know, in the only place it is actually useful: in the mobile app, for freak sake. I mean, are you kidding me??! 

Whomever lead UI/UX for your mobile app should be fired.

UPDATE:
The new LinkedIn app is amazing and incorporated every suggestion I made.",5
2013-06-15 09:57:47,App review,"Unfortunately, some of the same applications are not available on the mobile app that would be viewed on a normal desktop applications, For example, one cannot view someone's rawards and honors from the mobile app. Additionally, when searching for a new contact, the search feature only allows you to identify people already in your current list of connections.w",3
2013-02-16 17:43:41,Decent but has some bugs,Works pretty well for the most part. Has a couple bugs with regards to sending a reply to a message that was sent to you. And it would be nice to be able to delete connections from within the app as well. But overall works pretty well and I don't have much to complain about.,4
2013-04-19 11:00:16,"Professional, useful tool for the law enforcement professionals.",This is an outstanding application that is very useful for the law enforcement and security professional.  I use this application in a weekly if not daily basis to network with other law enforcement professionals around the country.  It has also been useful in locating suspects and witnesses as well as their associations.,5
2013-03-20 06:26:28,LinkedIn App Review - GREAT,"I like the app, let's me do everything quicker from the app, that I am able to do on the online website version. Better than some others that I found to be lacking.  I am able to keep up my page and stay up to date. Highly recommend.",5
2012-01-07 02:43:17,Functional and efficient,Despite what others have said you can choose what emails it sends you. If you have an account it is much easier to see and access everything from the app than from a web page. The new layout is easy to navigate.,4
2012-10-10 10:54:17,Works ok but functionality and integration poor,"Nice to be able to use on iPhone... But sometimes limited functionality makes I more frustrating than worthwhile. Simple things... No in mail. Can't edit invitations. Links from email go to safari and then ask if want app. Open the app. Also if opens in safari, can't also open app, as sees two logins and kills one. Group info and notifications not clean. No decent query parameters to search for people on app",2
2012-09-28 10:40:41,Great idea...if the app worked,"I am a reformed foursquare addict. I use to check in everywhere, see if I could get a deal, compete with my friends, and sing its praises. But it's gotten less and less reliable, and I don't have time to try to check in three times everywhere I go because foursquare can't reach the Internet (when other apps can, just fine). Now I don't use it all. It shot itself in the foot, because you couldn't've had a more engaged user than I was.",2
2012-03-25 00:12:47,Buggy? Just when it gets to be useful...,"The worst possible situation with a new app: an elegant UI, intuitive, but it just doesn't work, no matter how much you wish it would. 

On an iPhone, I am experiencing the maddening situation of taking action on Linkedin from an e-mail, only to see the splash screen freeze.

I do WISH it worked though. I finally had to quit trying because I was afraid I'd get frustrated enough to throw my phone!!!!",2
2012-03-15 17:23:30,Of marginal use without ability to...,"edit profile.  Also, the Search functionality suddenly stopped working on my phone last night... arrgh.  Lastly, it would help to have to ability to add a personal note (a la the regular website) when inviting a new contact to connect.  Come on, guys, you can add much more useful functionality to this app!",3
2010-08-04 00:21:19,Works for me,"I like the app for basic functions, but it definately needs an update to add group functionality. I would like to manage my groups and follow group discussions thru the app.. Is it just me or do you guys think this is one of the slower apps? It takes a long time to load and switch between pages.",4
2010-02-23 02:31:27,Takes forever to load the connections list,"This app is awesome, but I noticed that it takes forever to load the connections list. Are you doing insertion sort each time I start the app and click to see my connections? This list should be saved sorted so loading it should be instant.",4
2010-04-22 01:29:14,Almost useless app without groups,I agree without groups this app is almost useless. The Facebook and Twitter apps far exceed this app. And with Linkedin becoming the up and coming social network this is app needs a lot of work. It would be nice to join your own group discussions on your phone/on the go. Also would be nice to search and join groups. Who ever is behind this app needs to kick this app up or it will be left behind.,2
2017-08-08 16:34:39,Annoying badges ever time I open my phone,"LinkedIn is pretty good app. I use is it to connect but am very annoyed at all the communications I and badges on the app icon. I like that you allow me to select what kind of communication I get but I have EVERY SINGLE ONE TURNED OFF. And I still get badges.

This is annoying and I don't care if 1 of my 500+ connections posted a story on the feed.",4
2009-11-07 19:21:21,Good but needs more features,"I like that I can keep up on status updates and messages but wish I could access LinkedIn groups. Currently I must sign in on Safari to access group functions and than deal with sizing issues. Now that LinkedIn has a following function, shouldn't the app have more features that tap into this change?",3
2017-05-11 16:44:48,Bug!,"Aye LinkedIn, whenever I try and 'easy apply' over the phone (iphone6), the keyboard doesn't close after entering the phone number, which means I cannot apply to jobs. I also cannot add my resume to my application while easy applying over the app either. Fix it! Also pay me for doing your tester's work. Sincerely, a Network Engineer.",4
2017-08-03 12:35:48,Works for me!,"I remember when LinkedIn first came out. Lots of people said, ""you need to use this, its great for networking."" I was like, ""nah."" Fast forward a few years and I am looking for NEW opportunities in a new career field. People closest to me said, ""get your LinkedIn set up good!"" I finally listened! It has been a true blessing to me!",5
2017-07-19 13:15:08,"Quick, easy, useful","The LinkedIn app is very useful as I can easily connect and communicate with my new business acquaintances. I get a lot of unsolicited recruiting inmail, but it doesn't bother me much as I have a form response saved in my quick text on my phone that I can easily respond with.",5
2015-02-10 12:13:59,Provides a fairly adequate interface to a great forum,"LinkedIn, the forum, I give five stars. However this app stumbles when trying to view a ver long discussion thread - say thirty to forty posts. I couldn't go back to all of the entries - there's a bug there. I had to go to Chrome on a PC to read that thread.

Overall, I still give the app four stars as I find it very, very usable!",4
2017-05-09 17:15:59,An excellent app keeps on getting better.,"I have found that LinkedIn is the best app for professional networking, Employment research, and knowledge sharing. New features being added all the time, and unlimited potential for job seekers, recruiters, content providers and marketers. So, stop thinking and start linking!",5
2017-03-16 22:51:58,A Must Have For Business,LinkedIn app makes it easy to connect with colleagues but most importantly industry leaders. Better than that is your ability to be apart of the same conversation they are having allowing you to stay ahead of the curve or better yet make the curve.,5
2017-01-08 17:46:14,Great App,Great resource for connecting with co-workers and companies. Also great resource for information and groups based on your interests. There is always room for improvement and I have seen it over this past year. Keep getting feedback and keep going in direction based on that feedback.,5
2016-09-30 12:54:40,Great networking app!,"This app provides a great way to make connections and meet other people in the professional business working world. It offers job listings where you can apply with your background and expertise. All around this is a useful and great app to have! 5 stars:) Thank you LinkedIn, Zach S.",5
2016-04-26 12:29:15,Go to app for Daily dose of news,LinkedIn has evolved from just a business connections app to a news feed app with a solid job search engine. Kudos to the engineering and product team for making the app so relevant in today world where millions of apps try to gain your attention!,5
2016-03-08 13:08:37,Garbage! Once Again!!,"UPDATE for March 2, 2016 version: once again, update doesn't complete, freezing and staying locked and unavailable at 60 percent installed. Otherwise, same situation and review as last time, which follows. Doesn't work. Has frozen indicating the app is about 75 percent installed. I can't access my account nor can I delete app in order to attempt a reinstall--although other reviews suggest that won't be any better. What moron released this version without (obviously) QA/QC. Used to be one of the BEST apps around.",1
2016-02-19 16:23:21,Disappointed with lack of features,"The app is basic and lacks a lot of features that you can use on a desktop, such as job searching and advanced searches of people. I wouldn't download a second app just to job search. It's silly that I can't do both on one app. LinkedIn overall has gone down in features available and gone up in the price of membership over the last few years. So disappointing.",2
2016-01-01 19:15:21,Huge misstep,"The latest version of the app is buggy and unresponsive - huge misstep and LinkedIn needs to address.  It takes a long time to load users, let alone your profile.  When a profile/screen does finally show up, it takes a long time to scroll or perform any actions (editing, scrolling, etc) on the app. More often than not the app just crashes. The UI is also not intuitive.... This is coming from someone who works in the SaaS world too and am used to constant change.",1
2015-10-16 01:32:39,Best social media site!,"Hands down.. Best professional Networking tool out there. No surprise.  I'm on this app everyday. It's an essential part of my professional work life. 

I know the product has to evolve, but Only ask that they not randomly change or remove features that are widely used.",5
2015-09-02 14:27:11,"Not bad, but not great.","I got the app looking to network out a little bit. It has it's positives, but every time I open the app I am asked to upgrade and to see ""who I know."" If I didn't add people in the first time, I'm not going to the 100th time either. Also, cannot search for the skills that I want to update. The interface tries, but fails, to be a Facebook style. Just an overall poorly designed app.",3
2015-01-16 13:55:30,Premier networking app,"Linked in is the premier tool for professional networking. The mobile app brings the major features of the site, and I especially like the news feed which updates you on companies you follow and the activities of your connections.",5
2015-01-24 10:56:45,Unable to remove connections? That's unnecessarily inconvenient,"While the app works fine in connecting to folks and browsing, it is a one way street. You can not disconnect with one of your connections via the app, which is EXTREMELY annoying and undoubtably intentional. I'm not a fan of intentionally bad programming as a means of getting customers to do what the company wants you to (in this case, acquire and keep as many connections as possible, even if they are no longer wanted)",2
2014-12-11 16:38:03,Great tool for staying up dated on colleague status,"I really like Linkedin for knowing how my business contacts are doing. On the flip side, be warned, like every other app LinkedIn wants to know all your contacts. 

I personally don't give access to all my contacts. There is no need to. I know who I want to keep track of and that's it. 

That being said, I love this app.",4
2015-01-08 21:29:07,Still getting the hang of things,"I'm still getting the hang of how LinkedIn works since I only heard about it a little while ago, but so far it seems really easy to use, easy to navigate and just an efficient social networking sight all the way around. Really like it. Well done 😎👍",5
2014-10-24 15:44:29,King of Everything,LinkedIn has been a part of my life for 5 years. I've only recently fully appreciated how valuable and varied my connections to people in the business world are. I feel better connected to them with LinkedIn. The current up grades and tweaks allow me to move effortlessly through my contacts and friends.,4
2014-11-28 08:27:51,Not a words with Friends,"It digs up some people I haven't heard from in years. It's like the 3/7 rule. You know 3 friends, 7 will turn into friends, and their 23 friends, And over and over.

But, it's professional not for posting pictures of your cat. Might work for networking if you had a side business. Not sure what-else it's for. Keeping track of fellow employees I suppose.

And that's all. No ads, that's a plus.",3
2014-05-10 16:06:34,Works well,"I like the current iOS version. While you cannot do all of the same things as you can from the desktop version, you can still get caught up on updates, search for people, search for company info., and receive and send messages. These are the functions I need while I am on the go.",4
2013-04-19 13:31:47,Great App!,The LinkedIn app is very easy to use and allows you to search for colleagues and groups just as you would on a regular computer. The only feature that I haven't been able to figure out on the app is how to endorse people's skills or how to view who's endorsed yours; this is still only available when you're on a regular computer.,4
2014-04-29 20:02:40,7.1.3 update but no camera option?,I updated app today and see no camera option in my status update window. I see what it is supposed to look like in the App Store screen previews. Mine doesn't have it. I'm on updated version of iPhone 5s. Restarted. Still nothing. What gives? Plus I agree with others that you should be able to remove contacts mobile app. Annoying.,3
2014-04-20 02:54:00,The NSA of apps,"LinkedIn is a good business resource.  But I've got this love/hate relationship with it.  Using the website is so much easier... I find the iOS app to be awkward at best, and downright confusing at worst.

The features simply do not work over half the time.  A window pops up... and just remains a white, blank screen.  Huh?  

But the bigger overall problem with LinkedIn is like the NSA of social apps.  They SOMEHOW mine your email without your permission.  How do I know this?  Because I see too many people appear on the ""People you may know"" that simply should not be there.  They are not ""friends of friends"", and they are not same industry.

Sometimes when I email someone, a few days later they will pop up in the ""People you know"" list.  Just too creepy.",2
2014-04-18 16:45:16,"Efficient, practical and perfect for the professional on the go!","I love this app! It allows me to keep up to date with as I do with my email and maintain excellent communication with my contacts! It is easy to use and navigate through. For smart phone users and professionals on the go, this app is a must!",5
2014-03-12 03:07:29,Amazing,"LinkedIn has given me the chance to expand my social network on a business level, which would not have been possible on twitter or Facebook. LinkedIn is the app/place to be if you want to expand your business connections and invest in your future.",5
2013-12-04 01:11:05,Older was better,If you haven't updated from version 6 yet then DON'T!! This new version is HORRIBLE!!! They took away the ability to see who's endorsed you and let you endorse others on iPad. Now when you click on a link or profile it creates a new window and they just stack on top of each other and are as annoying as crap. You also can't edit as much on your profile. Yea it looks prettier... But I want function over fashion! Going to your profile through Safari or chrome is more efficient!,1
2013-07-08 13:27:37,An app that's better than the website,"Very well constructed app. One of the few where the experience is actually cleaner and more user friendly then the website! Easily navigate to your profile, emails, groups, searches, etc. highly recommended!",5
2013-06-14 23:43:05,Best version of LinkedIn for iPhone yet,The new update makes LinkedIn more user friendly than before and the presentation of content is cleaner and more accessible. Overall excellent upgrade that shows a lot of thought and effort was spent providing users with better experiences.,5
2013-03-08 19:44:32,"Great app, though buggy lately",Great app for tracking contacts and knowing who you are meeting with.  After recent release though the integration on iPhone which allowed downloading/merging with contacts will no longer work.  This was great to get profile pictures into your address book.  Please fix this in next release.,4
2013-04-09 05:38:38,Worthless! LinkedIn... Your days are numbered...,"... and that means you'll have to got to craigslist to get another job! This app is a total mess!!!

For starters... You ask to sign on to look for people you know... Before the sign-up registration is thru... A step before the email confirmation... You can't sign on before that there is no profile yet... Do you have monkeys developing your software?

Signing on... Everyone's private!! No big surprise! But what use is this for newcomers looking to interact with potential employers and marketing? There is nothing easy about this community! 

To be honest... LinkedIn is over! You once for the attention of the corporate world, buts its their wives at home that will support and app like Facebook... Corporate America does not have time for this! 

And you abuse the email channels so you deserve to die out! 

So long Friendster!",1
2013-04-07 14:42:55,Artificial positive reviews,"LinkedIn's handling of the complaints about endless spiral of mobile version app pop-ups while navigating on the Safari version, is poor.   It also looks like the (soon to be jobless) designers of the LinkedIn mobile version are the only ones reviewing this app positively.  The similarly brief positive reviews are an indication of an attempt to keep the number of overall stars artificially high.  

Fix the app, lose the pop-ups and go back to being a business networking resource, you are not Facebook!",1
2012-12-31 23:01:30,Lots of work needed!!,"This app is OK I guess for when you don't have access to a desktop. My messages constantly mess up or won't send and I've missed numerous important emails thru this app. Luckily for me, the people had my personal email and sent them to that also so being that this is suppose to be for ""professional/business"" networking, it's worthless. BUT when they hopefully get all the bugs worked out, it will be very useful! Please hurry to fix it!",2
2013-02-26 06:52:05,App over. Crash = very yes,"This app loads the main screen fairly quickly, and provides three main navigation choices. Once you make your selection, the app will promptly tell you to ""eff off"" because it will crash. LinkedIn is an amazing service, and this app is embarrassing to the brand. Whoever okayed this app for distribution (iPad mostly) should be promptly fired for gross negligence.

Making connections could be easier, but mostly it's the crashing thing. I have been through 5 or 6 app updates, yet the problem persists.",1
2013-01-02 20:48:53,Works better on desktop & phone than iPad,"Just started using this for iPad mini and am finding it very cumbersome to use (; even on my iPhone it works much better. There's no way to use the Linked In jobs function when I look at the iPad app. Maybe using the full website is better for iPad. Not impressed at all. Hope they fix this! Also, can't view my full mailbox - not only inbox, but sent mail, etc. please make this more like the full site or at least the way it functions on iPhone.",1
2012-12-03 15:06:42,Nearly Useless,"Links to LinkedIn on iPhone don't work. Browser hangs forever. The redirect logic (to this app) is flawed. Worst of all, many have brought this to LinkedIn's attention, and it has not been fixed. I've run into this problem ever since the app was first launched and it's still broken.

Other than that, using the app independently it offers limited functionality compared with the web version.

Recommendation: Do not use until LinkedIn gets off their arse and fixes the 'link from email to app' bug.",1
2012-09-28 14:47:46,Good overall - one suggestion,"I enjoy using this app on my iPhone and iPad. One suggestion though is to give you the option to send an introduction (that you can edit) when sending a LinkedIn request. You can do this on the regular site but not the app, which I'm disappointed with. 

Other than that this is a great tool and I use it daily!",4
2010-01-09 15:51:08,Much better.  Could be even better,"The new version is vastly better, allowing for many more features.  However there are still a lot of bugs. New contacts never become 'un-new', application crashes from time to time.  Looking forward to next update.",4
2012-05-02 04:36:22,Clunky at best,"For a company born in the social media spotlight, I expected much better. For all that you can do in a browser interface on a pc, I expected to be blown away with the iPad interface, add to that how long it has taken you to go from an iPhone app to an iPad app, and my expectations were apparently too high. All I can say is that I have come to depend on LinkedIn as a necessary business tool that I have to use daily, unfortunately for now,  I'll keep accessing it via my pc or my iPhone. You guys are capable of MUCH better, this is sad.",1
2011-09-06 13:27:54,Surprised,"I'm shocked people don't like this update. This is now one of the cleanest and most stable apps I have ever seen. It's gorgeous. Very easy to navigate and just feels like what an app should feel like. Only wish would be to be able to make some profile changes while in app. Beautiful app, thank you.",5
2011-08-21 02:42:21,"I don't get all the negative feedback, I like it","It's simple to use, with the newest update it looks and feels fun to use and it provides what I need, easy and quick access to my contacts, to search for other contacts and my inbox and my profile etc.",5
2011-03-26 17:26:35,LinkedIn should learn from...LinkedIn members,"Putting out an app that lacks so many desirable features is worse than having no app at all. If LinkedIn would read its own members' pages, it would know that its social-media-savvy customers want what this app fails to deliver: access to groups, ability to edit your profile, and iPad compatibility.

At minimum, there should be a fully-functional paid version. Shameful!",2
2010-09-03 15:50:29,BUG Alert !!!!!,"In the iPhone settings tab, the ""turn connections"" view on/off setting automatically turns itself to the OFF position without notice. For some reason it does not hold the setting you choose. This is a major v3.2 blunder, and can cause you to miss connection activity. Please fix this asap, as this is rather annoying!",3
2017-01-13 23:22:18,Great free app to help you grow,"This is a great free application that allows people to connect professionally and allows someone to find personal career growth. I never use the LinkedIn before but after I started my career as an animator an illustrator, I phone my client pool grew exponentially. For a freelancer this is a great opportunity to showcase your work as well as who you are on a professional level",4
2008-10-05 20:18:13,Not bad but could have more features,Nice overview of posted info. Nice to be able to invite connections. Would be even better if u could accept invitations and have the ability to edit profile. I was not able to find my groups either. Still with the download. But more could be added to make this more functional.,3
2017-09-02 16:11:51,Great professional app,I created LinkedIn in account however started using only from weeks.. This app is awesome for people who wanted to maintain the professional relationship wherever they go!!! I also strongly recommend for people who wanted to explore the market demands and opportunities towards it👍,5
2017-05-08 06:24:49,"Randall R.Edwards, Sheriff (Retired)","I have had a free LinkedIn account for about eight years, I have accumulated over thirty five hundred contacts. LinkedIn will no longer allow me to accept any new contacts. Every time I try to accept an invitation to connect, it just goes to ""building contacts"" and ""calendar sync"" and offers me an opportunity to try LinkedIn premium for a month free. I have tried to contact LinkedIn with the problem and have not been able get a response, I'm guessing they no longer allow free accounts!",1
2017-04-27 15:12:31,Such a helpful tool!,LinkedIn has helped me find potential jobs and actually got me employment. This tool can be crucial in finding a job. It opens up a level of transparency for employers to see which is very attractive. I use this daily even though I have a job (thanks to LinkedIn!),5
2016-03-24 13:24:25,Uber Networking Hub,"This is an excellent tool for business networking and job hunting, in particular! I love the tool...fairly easy to use. Has some stability issues to work out. I hate that some users confuse its intent with FB by posting inappropriate content: selfies, personal updates with no business context etc. Hope they can get that under control.",4
2016-10-21 20:39:57,The best version 👍🏻,"I use Linkedin apps for few minutes before i delete it because of the impracticality! 
But this version actually survived more than a week now and i really find it pretty good and practical. 👏🏼👏🏼
Thank you Linkedin team for the continuous development of the app.",5
2016-10-19 12:17:24,Latest version buggy and prone to failure,"This app used to be a handy complement on the iPhone to the desktop version, but over the latest two updates or so has become useless more often than not.  When you can get it to open, it frequently shows things like connection requests or profile views have occurred, but the won't show them to you.  It also bogs down and processes endlessly about 80+% of the time.",2
2016-10-17 23:33:06,Love it,Joined to keep in touch with professional contacts in a more professional setting. Enjoy not wading through endless pics of everyone's dinner or vacations or  whatever we're posting today. Also enjoy the discussions & articles from people in my field.,5
2016-09-21 19:24:44,Use it everyday - Well done!,"I use this app everyday, to check the updates, to reply to my connections, to share. You can easily ask to connect to someone. I think I like it better than the website itself for some features. Good job!",5

2016-02-12 15:14:29,"Easy to use, and could improve","I like to speed at which I can make contact with my network. 
I would like to only see the page where I can delete a suggestion of contact as well as accept. 
I would also like to go easily to a choice page of short emails, similar to the congratulations email.",4
2016-01-20 19:52:52,LinkedIn is not Facebook.,"App works well. 
I have to go in and change defaults on all notifications and articles I respond to. Don't want to always be notified because I like an article. Don't want to notify my network every time I get a new contact or make a change. Default should be what most people want. Not what LinkedIn wants.",4
2014-07-18 06:34:15,Cool App,"LinkedIn is cool...connects us to lots of other people in a professional way at the click of a mouse.   Only complaint I have is when I see I have new connections in the drop down menu, I try to click on one of them and it takes me to all of my connections...top of the alphabetized list.   This feature is lame.  Can't they fix that??",4
2015-12-22 19:09:54,"Improvements, suggestions and frustrations...","I'd been an avid LinkedIn mobile user, but the updates have seriously reduced my enjoyment and time spent using the app.

I like that emailing articles is standardized, but don’t like that header is lost, so the subject is blank, I’d prefer it to include the article header as email subject.

The app frequently fails to refresh my Home updates. Also, it only allows for a limited amount of updates, not scrolling for a far down as I’d like.

Company Profile>Ways to get introduced. Should include the title of the person you’re looking to get introduced to, as that is the single most important data point in looking for connections.

My Network>I’d like to thumbs-up the updates, as I don’t always want to send a message.",2
2015-12-14 03:39:51,The worst design update,"I had become used to the original UX, this latest update just ruined it entirely.  The only thing good is the Messaging section at the bottom - the entire message threads are well organized.  Everything. Else is bad - profile summary is collapsed, my network section has two icons on the top, they aren't intuitive.  I couldn't even find the Who's viewed my profile section.  This is an ugly update, and I hope users are given an option to revert to the original one.",1
2015-12-13 16:09:37,Revert back immediately,"This the first time I ever taken the time out of my day to write a review on a APP but this new update is horrendous.

Please revert to the previous version immediately!!!!

I just upgraded my linked in app thinking like all other updates it just would fix small bux stuff that would be transparent to the ""user"" me 

the whole layout is ugly 
Vertical makes no sense vs the horizontal layout ( previous much better)
I can't see my connections any more or my connections connections  

This is making linked in a terrible 
network tool ( and it was the best professional platform previous but with the new update its almost better to just delete the account and try to find a better professional network system)

PLEASE fix this immediately  and revert back to the way it was!!!!!",1
2015-12-04 12:12:17,One Step Backwards for Mankind,"Despite the value of LinkedIn as a professional social networking application, the decision to force the tablet version to mimic the phone version, banishing the landscape version without giving the option to choose, was unintelligent to a remarkable degree.  It's an arrogant and callous decision, not unlike ACT!'s decision to move to the SQL database, which caused many of its loyal users to leave it enmasse causing it to virtually disappear from favor overnight.  My only regret is that there are no negative stars with which to rate this new (spew) version.",1
2015-12-02 12:41:22,Still terrible,"LinkedIn consistently has the worst mobile experience of any professional tool that I use regularly. The web site has viewport and text field issues, but the iOS apps are even worse, and the recent update doesn't change that. Why they are unable or unwilling to present a mobile experience comparable to the desktop web interface is just baffling, and it really limits my on the go usage. Competing app developers take note: it's a perfect opportunity for disruption.",1
2015-09-08 21:48:28,Very annoying,"I want to like this app. I want to use it and grow in my industry and take advantage of all it has to offer.. But the terrible design of this app makes all that impossible. At least on mobile. The last straw is now I can't even use the app because it's asking me to download it's sister app and won't register me pressing the ""not now"" button. Fix your app LinkedIn!!!! It shouldn't take several minutes to open a discussion, especially when you email me All The Time about them. Poor show.",1
2015-07-24 11:41:36,Freezes too often,"Although convenient, it is frustrating that I have to retype comments and messages multiple times due to the app freezing. Also after reading a few articles it usually freezes and I have to close the app (stop in the background) and reopen. It would be nice if there were more setting-features on the app.",3
2015-06-10 20:23:37,Love this app,"I love this app because it allows me to connect with customers even after hours. We can communicate without any middle men and time constraints.

The analytics on LinkedIn are continually improving as well. Their suggestions and updates are becoming more and accurate to my needs.",5
2015-05-27 03:22:24,Are you $@&?!! kidding me?!?!,"I get an InMail from one of my contacts. I reply to the mail in the app itself. I click send... and it crashes without sending and without saving a draft. Every. Flippin. Time.

I suppose it shouldn't surprise me. I mean, after all, LinkedIn isn't designed to be a tool for networking and communicating with those connections... Oh, wait, that's EXACTLY what it's for!!! Unfrigginbelievable!

Until they get some competent software QA (bugs happen, but this never should have made it out of QA), I would take a pass on this app.",1
2014-11-28 03:05:00,iPad app not recognized,"Whenever I open some content from an email sent by LinkedIn, it opens my browser and asks if I want to get app...which I have. Then when I do launch app I have to sign in which is very annoying and I don't do since I have strong passwords managed through a program.

Bottom line is that I NEVER end up using the iPad app because of the password issue. SSO please! I don't know how other apps handle this but they do it and recognize my password.",2
2014-11-06 23:57:23,Required App,This app is required to keep your online professional resume/profile within an app's press away. Do some configuring of the options and then it becomes as useful as email. This has been a required app of mine on all of my phones for years.,5
2014-10-18 14:46:22,A Real Social App for Business,"An essential part of my working world, Linked In lets me effortlessly network with my industry peers. I work in a small engineering field, so this has expanded my world and learning opportunities, especially through the special interest groups. If you're in business, you need Linked In.",5
2014-09-08 02:31:37,"Ok, could be better","LinkedIn is great. This app is good. To go from good to great, need to be able to go from links to the item in the app. It is difficult to navigate from the home menu to the precise item you are looking for. I go back and forth a few times looking for the right link request, message, etc.  The job search finction is too limited to be of any practical use - needs help.",3
2014-05-20 23:19:20,"Good app, great for networking.",Very good app. The networking ability is great but the poorer business card integration with Evernote is a disappointment compared to previous integration with CardMunch. I would like the connections filters from the web-based version to be available on this app. That would make it easier to contact certain groups.,4
2014-03-23 19:31:11,App Review,"I cannot figure out how to edit my profile in the app. Like change or add a photo, for example. 

I give it four stars because its not a bad app, but easy editing should be an option. Or I'm an idiot and just can't figure it out..

Either way I love being able to browse and learn about my favorite companies and interests using LinkedIn.",4
2014-01-23 02:11:12,Great progress,Works fairly well for accessing LinkedIn on the go. A bit too much focus on pushing a FB/Twitter style newsfeed. Would be great if they could integrate CardMunch functionality into this app and allow scanning of business cards. Not easy to find contact info of people or sync it to your phone. Tries to force you to message on linkedin's platform.,4
2013-10-17 15:00:57,Overall very good!,"Like the new update and the overall presentation. Navigation is very easy, although accessing groups is a little tricky.
One major drawback is clicking on external web links does not automatically start the app, that needs to change and really is the only thing that's stopping me from giving it a 5 star.",4
2014-01-14 02:45:11,Useful Daily,"Great app! I use it almost everyday. I find this version to be more stable and I can get to more of the features I need. There's always room for improvement - continue evolving the mobile version toward the website version. Overall, one of my most useful apps.",5
2013-10-16 07:57:07,"No new features, and even reduced funtionality","I like the app but it is still a far cry from the web version in terms of what you can do. I also notice that the ""view original article"" feature is not showing the article at all and now I have to open it in the browser!?!?
More options and fix the ones that used to work, that's your goal for next update.",3
2011-11-16 06:35:55,"Great app, almost perfect","This is a really smooth, easy-to-use app for LinkedIn and it has a lot of great features and functionality, however it is lacking some features as well. For instance, people should be able to search for and join groups from this app. So far, I only saw search for people. Other than that, great app!",4
2013-08-09 13:08:42,Great App,I love this app and website. The app gives me access to everything on the website seamlessly. It's very easy to use. If I had to criticize one thing it would be not being able to access an email thread from the mail section. But I am sure that will come soon.,5
2013-05-19 07:43:39,Excellent,"LinkedIn has done such a great job with this app. I have had no problem whatsoever with it and I am actually more involved with my connections, groups and a diversity of great quality o articles that has helped me to gain knowledge in several subjects and skills. Well done LinkedIn and keep up the great job!",5
2013-04-19 02:42:26,Good news aggregator,"I mostly use the LinkedIn app as a news aggregator for business articles. Works well for that. It's nice that its also a social network at the same time. This version is a little less user friendly than the last, but works just as well.",5
2013-01-03 02:24:57,Linkedin,Had this App for a while. Went through a few updates and it never worked correctly. Over half the time it wouldn't open correctly and it would ask whether i wanted to download the App even though i already had it installed. After having to decline downloading it again it would open only some times then it was just plain cumbersome to use. Just got so frustrated that I finally deleted it and will wait till hopefully the creators develop one that works.,1
2012-06-05 00:45:12,Selene,"I am having the same problem as reported by another: the app doesn't finish loading. Plus even though I have the ap on my iPhone, when I get an email with invitation to look at something on linkdin it keeps asking me to download ap so it doesn't seem synced / aware ap is already there. 
I agree having capability to update ones own profile is needed; why use ap at all if you have to keep going on computer for most of what you need to do?",2
2012-05-04 04:23:54,"Missing key functions, confusing interface","My excitement over the new app quickly turned to frustration and disappointment. The navigation is very confusing, and the main function I use all the time-- my contacts-- is buried within one's  profile with no way of easily searching them.  There seem to be all sorts of additional pages of content that I am not going to use, while I can't use the ones I need.",2

I love the new interface for all the sections (email, inbox, groups, etc) and i love new interactions available such as the groups. Linkedin had made a tremendous improvement which had made me use it more. Keep it going!!",5
2010-07-07 17:47:40,Mmm it's ok,"Doesn't let you edit your profile, just view. Not a pretty interface, they went with the dashboard approach for primary nav but didn't execute all that well. I tried out the in person feature of Bluetooth contact swapping with 3 other people and only one contact came through. Had to manually enter the rest, so not impressed by that.",3
2017-09-09 02:17:49,iOS Engineer,"Very intuitive design and great performance barely notice latency.

Great job LinkedIn Engineering & Business Teams!",5
2017-08-20 17:21:26,Very Professional Application,I have been using this application Form couple of years and it's been keep improving every year. A very professional application which provides professional networking at your palm and you can get new connections with your finger tips.,5

2017-08-12 19:08:32,Nice alternative,"I've been using Facebook to keep up with friends and family, but also as my news source.  The negativity and unreliable sources is just out of control anymore.  With LinkedIn, I feel like I just found out where the grown ups are hanging out.",5
2017-08-05 02:15:57,If you're on social media you GOT to be on LinkedIn!!,"If you use social media for business, perhaps not every platform is right for you, but EVERYONE should be on LinkedIn.

2017-07-13 18:37:19,I use the LinkedIn app several times a day,"If your work requires you to be almost constantly moving, the LinkedIn app is perfect for you. I have received critical information on new opportunities using this app. It is an essential tool and I recommend it without reservation.",5
2017-07-18 14:30:37,Best version yet,This is the best version yet of this software however I would still hope that you would have more of the same capability especially on the larger devices that you do on the page itself. I often find that I make changes in one arena that does not transfer to the second. I also wish that the apps were more self contained.,3
2017-05-11 12:35:51,Great Connections,"In a day where we of not able to be everywhere at once, LinkedIn allows us to stay connected with the business community. The knowledge posted here is useful on so many levels. Thank you for bringing us all together and letting us grow.",5
2017-02-07 13:01:42,Great app!,"It's been a while since I've used my LinkedIn account.  Downloaded it again today, and it's been super easy to jump back into and get caught up on the topics I love.

2017-01-19 16:02:27,Latest update broke the app,I am very disappointed in the latest release. My feed won't update for more than a week now and the search function doesn't work and keeps returning 'no such profile' when you search for someone (who you KNOW is definitely on LinkedIn!). This is horrible for such an important and heavily used app.  This should have been fixed ASAP.  Fix it please.  It's starting to look bad.  I have resorted to using the LinkedIn Sales Navigator app. At least that is working!,1
2016-10-27 20:29:30,LinkedIn is a one of a kind,"LinkedIn is a one of a kind powerhouse. If they don't get it right the first time (which they usually do), you can be certain that their continually advancing set of apps will be upgraded and improved within weeks. Highly recommend!",5
2016-10-24 00:53:11,Product Management Fail,"I used to login in daily and look at a set of cards that would outline what I needed to do that day. It included congratulating people, birthdays and accepting invitations. After speaking with the LinkedIn help desk it turns out that the product management team deprecated this feature. To accomplish the same daily task that used to take 5 min I now must go to three places and even then it still does not do a good job of telling me what is going on. Product Management please bring this feature back.",1
2016-10-06 13:35:45,Hdl39,"Great app. Love the new job search and career search tools, it's like having a headhunter in your pocket, who's letting you know about opportunities and what you need to do to prepare for careers. Not a networking tool anymore. A must have for the modern economy where moving jobs isn't a last resort it's a fact of life.",5
2016-09-23 01:07:42,Full Complement of Options,Have used this app for some time now.  Hardly ever access LinkedIn from my PC any more.  I especially like how I can set up job search criteria and I get a list automatically - including others who work there and who attended my same university.,5
2016-09-12 17:09:13,Great App / Needs Flexibility,"Love the app but I don't want the app trying to force me to do things I don't care to do. Prompts that come up periodically that make me scroll over and over just to get to the app. All about add these people and that; I understand that's designed to help people figure out how to use the app, but please don't make it so annoying. One or 2 prompts is fine; 6 is ridiculous. My opinion. Thanks",3
2016-07-12 15:29:16,News blurb feature great addition,I like the addition of what individuals are doing around the country or world. The message feature allows DirecTV contact between users. I like that. The features are getting better. I think they could really improve on the ease ability of accessing what you are looking for.,4

I'm going with 1 star for the amount of time it takes to get through all of their recommendations and service offerings every time I open the app. If you're going to offer all of that stuff before taking me into the app, at the very least present a skip or ignore button so I can avoid flipping through every single page before I can exit.",1
2016-01-21 19:18:42,"New Look, not so improved","The previous look of LI may not have been as smooth, but had easier functionality. This new version (late 2015) lacks a newsfeed that shared new connections of your connections, essentially ""friends of friends"". And it's a loss. That was a great tool for common introductions.

The new version loads only in portrait, forcibly switches my iPad view to portrait mode, and I can't see any of the things I was able to see before. 

This was supposed to be the update that revolutionized LinkedIn and propelled it towards the future.  Personally, I am uninstalling and will switch to using the website until LinkedIn comes to its senses.",1

Update:  Got it work by deleting, rebooting iPad and then reinstalling.  But it wasn't worth the effort because this new update is a big step backwards.  Will probably just delete again.
This used to be a pretty good app, but now it is very poor -- I just hate it and find it quite worthless.",1
2015-10-06 02:54:28,From a social media phobe,"The one thing I don't like about LinkedIn as a service is the same thing I dislike about all social media: it scans every contact list it can find to suggest connections. I keep some people in my contact lists under the name ""Do not pick up"". Having LinkedIn suggest those people as someone I'd like to contact is unsettling. I hope the suggestion does not go both ways.",3
2015-09-24 03:21:08,The LinkedIn app gets worse with every update,It would be nice if LinkedIn actually QA they app prior to release to fix all the bugs that are introduced in every new update. It would be even nicer if LinkedIn fixed some of those annoying bugs but with the latest update they really went over the wall. Every time the app is launched it asks you to connect to your contacts and no matter how many times you choose to cancel the prompts still come up with no way to stop it.,1
2015-02-09 14:56:57,Convenient,"I don't have a lot of time to spend on LinkedIn, just being honest. So I like that this app notifies me of the important things (messages, connections, etc.). I can check them, reply and quickly get back to work. I also use the LinkedIn Connect app. It works great as well.",5
2015-03-04 23:09:44,Needs some tweak in for whatever reason my app keeps crashing as sain as I open it,Since the last update the connections of the people I'm connected to are no longer displaying. Also you really need an option to edit from the Facebook app. It would make it far easier than to have to keep trying to use the full site using my phone.,3
2015-01-04 03:52:55,Love love love this app,This app has really helped me grow my professional contacts as well as grow my client base. I just hope it stays professional as it starts to look more and more like FB. P.S. Please make all functions online available through the app. I'm on the IPhone more than the computer. Thanks.,5

2014-12-10 14:32:42,Nothing Special,"Considering the resources available to LinkedIn, the apps they offer are disappointing. The iPad app is nearly pointless with lots of weird delays and page mashups. The iPhone app is actually much more manageable. Just an opinion as I love LinkedIn as a company and use it every day. The apps could be much better and should include a check in feature considering the business nature of the model.",3
2014-08-25 05:26:39,Badge notification incomplete,"Showing a badge, the circle and number on the app icon, should mean that the application opens on the new notifications.  Instead it just opens the app to the home screen or whatever was last displaying.  It's a strange omission on an otherwise well-designed app.  I expect to go to some notifications summary",4
2014-09-20 21:39:37,Poor flow,"The app is generally clean, but the workflow is poor.  For instance, when I get an email from someone wanting to connect, I have make 4-5 clicks to accept it instead of just one, and I have to find each of the clicks.  A better way to do it would be for the email to have a click to open the app and go directly to the page where I can accept or decline the connection.",3
2014-07-12 00:26:42,I ENJOY this App BUT...,"LinkedIn has allowed me to connect and network with a lot of different professionals across the world; however one thing I wish they would fix is letting you review a job description after you've already applied to it...sometimes I have to revisit all aspects of the job entails just in case I get an interview, but I can't!",4
2014-08-14 15:58:23,Principal,"This is a terrible user experience; the screens are hard to view with grey type; the moving from screen to screen is awkward; hard to separate emails from invites. I like LinkedIn a lot but only on desktop. 
The iPad version is only a little better than this poor iPhone version.

Since I pay  for the Premium account. And so many of us write about User Experience you would think LinkedIn would do a better job.",2
2014-04-28 23:28:47,Removal,I think the overall app is very good. The only thing I would suggest adding is a way to remove contacts. I have a handful that do nothing but constantly spam or like pictures of women. I know I can do it from my laptop but 99.5% of the time I am using my smartphone. Just a suggestion. It's a great tool for the professional person.,4
2014-06-27 21:41:12,Beautiful job seeking and professional app,"Going to make this short and succinct. No other app, mobile or not, compares to this one in regards to seekin g employment or a professional career. Though one must build credentials for her or himself to get somewhere, this powerful tool will make it all the more simpler. It's all about how you use it.",5
2014-05-10 04:48:18,Best program for building business connections,I use this program daily from both my computer and  iPhone. It never crashes or freezes. Absolutely a must have and use if you want to connect to business people.,5
2014-04-17 15:30:06,Awesome,Works ok and I like that I can get to connect with people all over the world before I travel to different island and country I always fine out as much as I can and your app allow me to do that an I trust the information that I receive here more than the other site,5
2014-04-12 02:23:34,Great App easy to use!,"LinkedIn is a wonderful product, having the iPhone and iPad app make my day to day functions with LinkedIn even better. Connect with professionals, check messages and stay update on events. LinkedIn is changing the #InternetOfThings and how people are connected.",5
2014-04-03 14:35:02,Linked In Is the BEST!,"LinkedIn is so live & so busy. There's a lot of interaction & feedback from viewers & people always appreciate what one does, whether it's Music, Acting, IT work, they are always complimenting other's work & are very inspirational , uplifting & mature individuals. They're definitely supportive & are always ready to cheer! 

Much Love, Singer, Songwriter, Performer--Emria .",5
2013-12-29 05:25:57,Business owner,I have seen linkedin from the beginning. I like each upgrade and change. Great work. Continue to advance and move forward improving and making better. Just as we are in our life and post about ourselves right here on LinkedIn ;) upward and onward!!,5
2014-01-07 11:42:51,Staying in touch,"Works great to stay in touch with colleagues including good people you may have met only once.  The user interface has some shortcomings - confusing between laptop, tablet and phone versions.  Some desired operations are not intuitive - ex, how to search for a specific influencer to follow.  (finding companies is easy) Disappointed the current reading interests were removed.",3
2013-06-16 15:07:55,Great app!!,I have the ability to make connection and apply for jobs.  Good screen interface and ability to build your resume.  Ability to receive news that interests you and also participate in group conversation.  Love the app.. Keep doing the good job LinkedIn!!,5
2013-10-09 23:20:54,Terrible,"The LinkedIn app interface is too bulky to be useful.  This app is only good for messaging and approving invites.  I need to use my PC for all the heavy lifting.

The most frustrating flaw is in the ""people you may know"" section.  If you are browsing here and you view a profile, the list will go back to the beginning and you'll have to start all over again.

I've tried to avoid this by using the mobile site, but when it's not reminding me that I should use the app, it's fumbling with all of my requests.",1
2013-06-05 12:47:13,Nice Improvements!,"I used earlier versions of this app and stopped due to a lack of functionality. That has been changed for the better!

Adding the ability to edit my profile on a mobile device has revitalized my use of this app. Nice job!",5
2009-03-08 14:26:18,Needs access to inbox and messages,The current functionality seems to work fine; I've not had any crashes or hiccups. But I think the functionality needs to more fully match the website. I really would like to be able to get to my messages from the app and be able to respond.,3
2013-05-30 04:02:49,Privacy Issue,"Great way to connect with  business professionals, however the app interface isn't great. Also, my least favorite part about LinkedIn is that you cannot block a user who is creepily stalking your page... even after reporting it. Users should be able to block people.  I am about to deactivate my account because a person will not stop looking at my page and it's making me very uncomfortable for my privacy and safety...",2
2013-03-07 06:29:04,Most Features Don't Work,"Search function...doesn't work
Sending connection invites...sends a message ""since you're a person I trust.."" Of course you wouldn't know it says that unless you get a response back saying.. Trust?!
Linking connections to address book... doesn't work
Sending an article or post to your email completely closes the app & doesn't allow for in app function
Messages, connect requests & activity doesn't update even after you've checked/read and or responded",1
2011-12-11 01:41:11,Do not update,"First, I LOVED the original LinkedIn app. Awesome app. This updated version is horrible. It looks pretty, but they removed the key functionality of sending out invites. Now this version does not allow you to send out invites, even though it has an invite button. If you have the old version, stay with it. LinkedIn, add back the feature and I will change my rating to five stars immediately. Without.....I would give you a zero, but that is not possible.",1
2010-03-17 02:39:35,"Good network support, horrible account support","I actually like the feel of the LinkedIn app - it's clean, clear, and relatively unobtrusive in its design. But my main need is not for a way to connect to my network, I want to maintain my account.

I enjoy rewriting, editing, updating, and optimizing my own summary, specialties, status, etc. This app will allow only the very minimal of account options.

I will probably remove this app in the near future.",2
2017-06-09 00:09:17,Love it but needs tweaked,"Love the app, but why not let us sort our feed by most recent like you can on the full site?  Also, please consider allow sorting the people we may know by number of mutual contacts.  It's silly to see people is share 3, 5, and 7 contacts with and then scroll down to find one with 345!",4
2017-09-08 22:19:30,Thankful!,"This app has the tools to give you an express network, and connection to numerous opportunity. It gives you motivation to do more , in order to increase your profile . It has been an excellent tool for my career. Even with my recent opportunity to attend Yale's SOM. Thanks LinkedIn!",5
2017-09-02 01:25:57,Fantastic App!,Love using LinkedIn to network and the job search app to find employment opportunities. I do recommend one thing. Please make a user friendly profile view that includes position description and accomplishments once you click on a profile!,5
2017-08-25 00:02:20,Great place for business professionals to connect,"I love LinkedIn, it's a great place to connect and network with like minded business professionals. LinkedIn allows you to showcase your skills and abilities while connecting with potential recruiters and job postings. Great app, great website, great business platform.",5
2017-08-13 15:56:41,Too busy,There are two major problems with this app: 1) It has WAY too much going on. The UI is too busy and I can't see what I want right away. 2) It is constantly trying to trick me into giving it access to the contacts on my phone so that it can spam everyone I've ever met and invite them to join my network. The fact that it asks me this over and over is the worst part. Just ask once and then go away.,2
2017-08-12 14:31:07,Positive & Motivational networking 🙌🏾,"I really enjoy networking on LinkIn not only does it gives updated information in the business world but, it promote encouragements & confidence to move forward to bigger and greater advantages that you may dream about but never thought about putting into action.",5
2017-08-04 01:38:37,Great app,"I find the new LinkedIn app to be very user friendly, easy to access and versatile. By far my favorite means to get and stay connected with people all around the world. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a way of developing a professional resource group.",5
2017-07-13 14:53:20,Great app,"Sometimes in life you just find things that just work.  This is one of those times.  I am very happy at my current job but I log into this app at least once a day.  I learn something new about one on my connections or how one CEO treats his staff.  The range of informations is fantastic, Great job.",5
2017-07-01 01:22:36,Facebook for Professionals,It's not my phrase… But I love it! I recently read somewhere that LinkedIn is positioned to be the new Facebook for professionals and I totally agree. From applying to jobs to finding great articles or just keeping up with past and current coworkers… LinkedIn has changed my life!,5
2015-09-17 13:50:22,"Simple, effective","I'm a fan of LinkedIn. The app will unexpectedly close from time to time, and gives me a new user tutorial a little more often then I'd like. It's a very small detriment to the application though. The application is very simple to use, and I recommend it for your portable device as The LinkedIn website has more function.",4
2017-03-22 12:36:12,Love it,"Easier search, super fluid, not too busy, really nice render... also love notifications and ability to continue to share, search for people, post, like, etc. when I'm on the go. Could use an easy integration (back and forth) with sales navigator app but all in all I love it!",5
2017-02-17 06:15:06,Best app to network and ultimately land you your dream job,"Linked in is by far the best way to get recognized between the professionals in your industry. And get recognized. And if you have some character, write an article now.. and see what reaction you may get. And it spreads like wild fire from there. Learn linked in well",5
2017-01-19 00:38:44,EXTREMELY BUGGY,"The app is terrible. It keeps thinking I recently created my profile and registers none of my updates as if I didn't have any because I just created my profile...even though I've been active on it for a while. It keeps crashing all the time. I can't even look at my LinkedIn profile through safari because it shoots me back into the app. Fix it, it shows how poorly linked in cares about their users...",2
2016-11-13 16:48:08,LinkedIn review,App is fine. The idea of it is great. Sadly the only thing I have to say negative is that it is slowly turning into Facebook. It used to be a site for networking professionals. It has now turned into a politics and opinion filled site with rare professional job postings or job related things. I deleted my Facebook because of those reasons and I feel I'm going to do the same with LinkedIn unless it changes back to what it's intended use was for.,2
2016-07-28 14:12:20,Watch your privacy setting,"Yesterday I updated my APP. Today I Woke  up  only to get a calendar notification from Linked in. They said the new APP will periodically search my calendar and connections to make better suggestions.   that is a horrible feature they just hacked my phone info and put it on their sever.   

When checking the privacy settings it is unclear if this is a default that is always on or a setting you can change. I have an iPhone so hopefully Andriods are different",1
2016-05-26 07:19:04,A great app,"My use of Linkedin has increased after I started using latest app. The way it is organized for notifications, headlines, connections and suggestions make it easier to use. In seconds you congratulate people on their roles. Sharing news is easy and fun.",5
2016-03-08 15:40:26,Creepy,"How does LinkedIn manage to make a bad app worse? Download the update and find out. It's still laggy. Shows less relevant data. And also now is much more creepy. Somehow it's tracking my location because it ""suggests"" that maybe I want to update my profile to a new City which I happen to visit frequently. There are no location service settings for the app so I don't know if it's bypassing privacy settings or somehow reading my IP and broadly knowing where I am with no way to turn it off.",1
2016-01-01 14:26:21,Why!!!!  Terrible Update!!!,"The new update is awful.  What used to be a 5 star app, is now a waste of time.  Please change this app back.  The new updates are convoluted, they in no way help.  We used to be able to endorse with ease, find connections with ease, edit with ease, now it's a jumbled mess. Was a huge fan, now I'm just disappointed.  Poorly done.  Anybody who gives this new version of LinkedIn a good review, obviously had some hand in designing the new platform.  They did a terrible job, completely dropped the ball.",1
2015-12-16 00:35:51,From everyday user to a never user,Where do I start to list the ways in which this app is totally useless? The whole app seems to minimize the ways in which I can actively manage my network of both PEOPLE and COMPANIES while maximizing LinkedIn's opportunities to collect more data about me (i.e. fill in more profile data or create more connection).  The whole thing just feels like a scam now for them to leverage our data while providing little value to the users.  Such a huge step backwards!,1
2015-11-10 21:43:25,Best app and site for professional networking,My one only site and app for professional networking.  I use it almost daily.  The iOS app is very useful for getting info before going into a meeting or quickly jogging my memory about people/names/mutual connections when I'm out.,5
2015-01-19 15:01:21,"Good, stable app. Other areas of improvement",Overall the app is good and stable and does what it's supposed too. My only complaint is as a student there should be a cheaper version of the pro subscription. Down the road after students graduate they would be more likely to pay the higher subscription rate.,4
2015-06-09 02:34:28,Stop showing emails and asking me to add contacts,"First, LinkedIn displays your PERSONAL email address to all your contacts. Because of this, I changed my email address and only included one that is for LinkedIn. I kept getting spammed from contacts. 

Second, the app is constantly asking me to add contacts from my iPhone when I open the app. This happens every time I open it, even though I cancel it. Wish they would fix this.",2
2015-04-18 16:24:59,Another social exploitation network...,Being able to connect with actual coworkers and people from your industry for networking is fine but often you're exploited by mass recruiters. You have to pick and choose carefully or you will be receiving useless messages all day. Also every time you open the application it puts you through the same information/setting you skipped purposely. I just don't use it anymore.,2
2015-02-14 13:02:43,My main networking app,I have become s reliant on the LinkedIn app I can't imagine what I would do without it.  This iPhone app is well designed and fits all the important features into a compact package. I do notice sometimes it does not communicate right away with my LinkedIn app on my computer.,5
2015-02-09 09:52:50,"Great for networking, OK for social media","For many professionals, a LinkedIn profile is essential career component. It's where recruiters find you, and your colleagues will actually visit the site so there's a chance for actual networking.

I've always found the site to be clunky. The app is more polished, but some features still lacks depth (groups, messages). I do like the main update feed, and the new pulse feed.",3
2015-02-09 03:51:47,"Great App, and Powerful Tool","Excellent app.  The interface is really easy to learn, and the news stories are always an interesting read.  Overall, LinkedIn is a powerful tool that when wielded wisely can give users an unparalleled advantage in building the career thy are passionate about.  Highly recommend!",5
2014-08-20 18:19:27,"Solid app, delivers plenty of info","This app has a big job- deliver a world of business and connections to a mobile screen. It does it well. Sometimes it's a bit difficult to organize and parse specific information that I'm looking for, and private messaging could use some work, but overall, this is great!",4
2014-12-19 14:04:10,First Rate App,"Since it's inception, LinkedIn has created a wonderful platform that makes networking easier but also helps to demystify the whole process of finding employment.  The educational tools are second to none.  I really enjoy the app and I recommend it to everyone.",5
2014-12-04 17:33:53,Love this app.,"It is simple and easy to navigate. Unlike most social apps, LinkedIn kept it basic and user friendly. I only have one complaint and it's not having the option to remove a connection unless you're on the desktop site.",5
2014-09-17 11:20:29,Best professional social media outlet out there!,"From managing your online profile, resume, connecting with people in your industry or not, I recommend being on LinkedIn for anyone. It's been a great marketing tool for me and I've met a lot of clients through this outlet that I've developed solid relationships with.",5
2014-05-20 13:20:55,Good app for working professional disciplines,"This app is beneficial for individuals who have a trade or skill to easily look around to other disciplines or fields to seek future opportunities. Although lately I have discovered material that is more along the lines of an individuals' preference and not of the individuals' profession. Be that as it may be, this app is very useful for a person who is seeking new opportunity.",4
2014-06-27 06:34:31,Lots of improvements needed,"Known bugs:
*Always says you have updates though you open the app and have none
*will not update recent people who have seen your profile. You can see their smaller image in the top but once you tap to see who has viewed it, those people don't show.
*job search is sloppy & difficult to use. It cannot remember where you left off so you must scroll from the top every time and recognize where you left off.
*no ability to edit profile
*does not show additional content on profiles (links, documents, video, etc...)
*cannot endorse skills of connections

For a site that focuses on professional connections, I am surprised that this app lags so far behind. Please give this some TLC.",2
2014-05-14 14:30:28,Linked In,"I have joined several groups and most of the others in the group are CEO's or somewhere high up. I have lots of hands on experience but do not have a PHD. I am ignored and feel that I have nothing to offer these highly learned people even I may know as much as they know. So I have a high school diploma, experience can put me equal with someone else.",4
2014-05-12 01:08:51,"Clean interface, Always Improving",Nice user experience. I think it's great but my one complaint is the clunky-ness in giving and receiving reviews. Even the desktop experience makes it hard. I have people willing to give them but LinkedIn makes it really hard to find and execute the process. Anyway - that's my big gripe so 4 stars.,4
2013-11-12 06:16:13,No complaints,"I don't use the app very much at all, but am very happy with it. I've never had a problem and when I have a need to update or check something out, I can do so easily and effectively. I also like the updates. They do a good job improving overall UI in functionality and overall look and feel.",4
2014-02-06 12:44:34,Professionalism,"Excellent professional social media package that allows you to exchange your strengths without spamming or exchanging mindless information. 
Very effective tool for recruiting and career advancement.

2013-06-14 23:01:46,Very useful and well designed,"I find the newest version of the LinkedIn app to be flawless.  The amount and type of information available is fantastic. I use it to check out the background of people I work with, brush up on their credentials and connect.",5
2013-10-10 05:43:17,Defines useless...,"I downloaded the app to do a quick ping to a connection. If there is a way to find my connections it is hidden (and I *write* apps). 

If you want Facebook comes to LinkedIn, download this. If you actually want the things LinkedIn is good at in a mobile form, wait until they release a real app instead of updates and your profile. Basically useless for anything a professional would care about. 

And I write apps and advise those who do. My advice to LinkedIn: hire people who know how to design iOS apps.",1
2013-06-28 11:23:44,Poor implementation,"Unfortunately, I have to agree with the poor reviews here. The most frustrating is that the app at first glance seems to be very promising. Once you start using it for a while, one can see it's a very poor implementation. On the iPad,it would have been better to just improve the Safari experience. One example - if one tries to leave a comment, once the words exceed the small provided box, they run off the box and cannot be seen. The whole experience is a lesson in frustration.",1
2013-06-17 14:37:58,Can't search for groups,I am using the iPhone five and I downloaded the LinkedIn application and When I try to send out invitations to connect with people from my phone it tells me it sends but when I go into my inbox and click under sent invitations it does not show that I sent any invites at all! Does anyone else have this problem! I can only add connections via my computer!,3
2013-04-18 11:40:23,Much better UX,"Version 6.0 brings iPhone users a much cleaner, simpler and better user experience than previous versions which were ugly and confusing. While this isn't the easiest and could probably get some tweaks, it is a great first step to fixing the many problems this app has had. Great job LinkedIn. Keep up the great work.",4
2013-04-21 21:01:11,LinkedIn app needs plenty of work,Tried to connect with a friend but I couldn't because the iPhone app requires you to input an email. I didn't know my friend's email and couldn't connect even though I found his LinkedIn profile. So close to connecting with my friend but yet so far. Facebook doesn't require you to know the friend's email to connect when you find their page.,3
2012-03-02 22:06:54,need profile version and company information,"Need iPad HD version. Also need company information, not only groups. So the iPad version has all the features of the web version, including searching jobs, applying jobs, Monster has these features on the iPad version. Thanks.",4
2013-04-13 13:54:20,Not Good,"I am STILL unable to personalize a connection request with this app an the worst part? - When I try to use the main website on my iPhone to do such (which is usually how I access LI as I don't typically carry a laptop with me wherever I go!), I keep getting directed to the mobile ""touch"" site which also doesn't let me personalize a connection request! 
Fix this (AND the mobile site) to restore the option to personalize a connection request like one used to be able to do on the old version!",1
2011-05-31 12:30:47,OK but needs a fix,"Since the most recent update I no longer receive connection requests via the app, only in my email. Beyond that, no real complaints, although I agree with others who have said it should be possible to make profile changes.",4
2012-02-17 16:57:08,Great App!,"This version of LinkedIn is easy to navigate through and keeps me updated, reminding me to check new articles and invites. Since I'm not always at a computer, I love the convenience of this mobile app. So far, no technical issues.",5
2011-11-19 06:29:16,Terrible USer Experience,"I'm not sure who thought up dividing the inbox from updates, profile, and friends--but this app could be natively designed for half the price of this custom app. Nothing makes sense. A 5 tab bar at the bottom would make a huge difference is UX and user flow. This app looks cheap and was not thought out. It's one of the most frustrating apps to use, especially compared to its desktop website. Every website should have a similar feel to its mobile app and vise versa--not here!",1
2017-01-24 16:07:12,Good career networking tool,"I have found LinkedIn to be a very useful tool for networking in my field and for helping to maintain activity in the current advancements in the industry.

2017-09-02 02:15:50,Using It More,"I have started using the app more and more and keeping in touch with professionals. Great posts and articles. Spend a couple of hours using it and you will pick up on things that have an influence on your work, your business. Explore!",5
2017-08-24 23:24:03,Excellent App...some users treat it like Facebook.,This app has put me in contact with multiple recruiters and began the process for me landing two consecutive phenomenal career positions.

2017-08-10 15:03:03,Excellent!,"I value the fact that I can receive updates from my network, find useful information and contacts and even promote roles available in our company. I perceive there is a continuous effort to improve the app and the user experience, well done!",5
2017-07-14 11:56:36,Professional Standards,Thank you LinkedIn for allowing a platform for those whose background and skill set look for an outlet that speaks to colleagues.

2017-05-04 13:16:01,"Lacks ""Split View"" compatibility on iPad/iOS 10","I use the iOS 10 feature ""Split View"" a lot on my iPad Air 2 (e.g. researching subjects with Safari and jotting notes in my findings in the Notes app pinned to the right in Split View column). LinkedIn app for iPad does not support this feature; though it does support Slide Over, which allows you to peek at other apps like Notes but not pin them to the side the way Split View does.

2017-01-08 02:22:09,Very Helpful,I have been actively using the Linked In app for the past couple of weeks and have been very satisfied with its performance! I would recommend since it allows for a professional contact within a social media platform.,5

2016-04-04 19:15:02,A professional alternative for staying connected.,There many features and the interface is great. Sure the app doesn't have a lot of fancy animations but I think that stuff adds little value to actually staying connected professionally,5
2016-03-11 05:20:13,Not a fan since the update,"I was a daily LinkedIn app user, but am underwhelmed by the recent update and can't get into this redesign.  Notifications are irrelevant (and not all adjustable) - my preferred action is certainly not to send a prefabricated DM.  Settings are buried, jobs section gone, and the LinkedIn jobs app doesn't hold the same relevant value.  The shown content also seems to have lost value (new algorithm or personalization attributes?).  I really want to like it, and gave it a shot, but believe the team can do better.",1
2016-01-11 12:49:29,New version is disappointing,"I've been using the app for past few years and the new version is very disappointing, its my first time writing a negative review for any apps.  I cant see any job change and anniversary updates on the main screen and its hidden in my network.  The Like option is gone and force me to put comments, but I dont like that.  Its trying to be more facebook like but turns out not user friendly at all.",2
2016-01-10 23:46:55,Happy with the update,To be honest i never used my LinkedIn account because i found it to be not user-friendly. This latest update has changed all of that and i look forward to using it more often.,5
2015-12-14 02:16:47,Linked in new app,"I completely agree with the reviewers that say the new linked in app is beyond horrible. In addition to what has been noted, I find the pastel concentration is very difficult on my eyes as is the added brightness. JUST HORRIBLE!!!!!!! Should have never upgraded but was finding it difficult not to do so because content was being portrayed in new version. Also, not all my groups migrated over and getting to groups is difficult. Also, my groups did not all transfer over.",1
2015-12-11 14:19:43,Missing landscape. App doesn't look like LinkedIn.,"This app seems to not know what it is, who its audience is. iPad users use landscape view constantly. The lack of landscape view is the kind of oversight you'd expect from a novice app developer.
The look and feel are nothing like the experience of LinkedIn on the web. The branding just doesn't match. The app has also been dumbed down so it's harder to do some things that were simple before.",2
2015-08-25 15:41:31,Great way to stay in touch,Always like seeing what past colleagues and contacts are up to. Have reconnected with a few past persons that led to new work for us. Like that I can always know where I can get in touch with them even after years have passed.,5
2015-05-01 16:00:22,Connect quick,I love this app. Connect with people quickly. I use it while I'm at an event and as soon as I leave event I search people on LinkedIn. I like the app because you don't need their email address like you do when you are on the website. It doesn't ask you how you know the person. Easier to send invites.,4
2015-06-03 15:52:36,Love it,"Since I don't do Facebook, Twitter or other social media, Linked In is my way to stay connected with professionals and to network. I really enjoy seeing what people are up to professionally and reading the articles that others post as well as posts from contributors I follow.",5
2015-01-06 03:52:11,LinkedIn iOS app rocks!,I used LinkedIn's Windows phone 7 app for years and was not happy with the performance or features. The iOS app is a night and day difference with great features and performance. I guess that's what happens in the app world and sadly why Microsoft phones will struggle as long as app developers give half hearted attempts to support lesser used platforms.,4
2015-02-19 12:14:31,"Love Linked In, App is meh","Overall, I like Linked In, but the app provides limited functionality.  That's what an app is for though.  It's meant to be a supplement to the web browser version.  

I would be willing to sign up for the paid version if they lowered the price point a little.  If they start their plans at say, $20 month for the basic plan, they could reach the 30's and younger crowd.",3
2015-02-11 18:28:28,Ought to be called LogIn,"It is unbelievable how frequently I need to RE-login to this app. It's annoying as hell to have to login over and over and over. I'm not rebooting my phone. This doesn't contain my credit card or password information. Yet LinkedIn doesn't seem to be able to keep my logged in. 
Overall, the app is...meh. Not great. Not terrible. But if you're going to make me login over and over again, the app better be extraordinary. It's not.",2
2015-02-04 16:01:27,LinkedIn,"Excellent way to stay in touch with business contacts and stay informed on your industry's news. Also, it is like having a resume posted all the time. You never know when the next opportunity will come knocking.",5
2014-05-07 15:55:20,"Get rid of ""similar companies""","The app is generally good, but one place it falls down is on the company pages. The app shows a list of  ""similar companies"" that is based on industry keywords, and is therefore pretty useless. Would be much better to replicate the ""people also viewed"" list that shows up on company pages on the web site.",4
2014-05-25 01:41:08,Amazing,"LinkedIn is great for networking & meeting other people with unique jobs, education, & abilities. The upgraded version is expensive & using the site can be confusing but help is provided & I believe it to be well worth it. You won't regret setting up your own LinkedIn account.",5
2014-04-18 13:39:06,Linked In - easy to use,"Very user friendly. Easy to navigate.
I enjoy the ""mini"" version of Linked In to check updates and whats happening with my network from the phone. I still do all of my editing from my laptop though... which is fine. I like having more control and larger viewing panel.",4
2014-04-08 06:46:08,Super cool,"This app rocks though I do not know how should I use it. And it's a little slow, there should not be so many graphics and things that are heavy in kbts and to be honest I do not know 95 percent of people that I'm connected to but as I said its fun to stalk on people just like on Facebook so I recommend it very much.",5
2014-04-10 14:52:21,"Useable, but not to Manage","If you like me put your laptop away in light of how well smart phones have integrated into our lives, get it back out cause this app only scratches the surface of what you need to properly manage your account.

As a viewer of information it is fine, but it is clunky and not fully ""cooked."" 

I await a meaningful update bringing the power of the platform to our smart phones!",3
2014-01-26 13:02:14,LinkedIn is great - this app is not,"Too many important features are missing on both the iPhone and iPad: like requesting a recommendation, and adding recommendations to your profile. The latter issue is the most frustrating - when recommendations come in an email on the computer, you see a button at the bottom of the message to 'add to profile', but it's not there on the app.
Navigation is inconsistent with the web version.
Just delete this app and use Safari or Chrome!",1
2011-11-08 16:05:57,Good app - need to fix the ios 5 crashes,"Good app - they just need to fix the crashes. I use this app a lot, so maybe I just run into those more often - seems like ios 5 has caused a crash issue for every app I own. If I could, I would give Apple 0 stars for ios 5, and app developers 5 stars for having to go through all this.",4
2013-09-08 12:50:02,Ok - but,"This app is okay - performance is a little lanky but other than that it's it seems to be fine. What I'd really like to see is to have all of the apps; the desktop, tablet, and the phone app sync their notifications. It's kind of frustrating to see or read a message and then find out that I have to do the same thing on each of the other platforms as well.",3
2013-08-08 15:16:36,Why LinkedIn why???,"LinkedIn, you have an amazing concept. How could you possibly allow such an awful app for the iPad? Do you think maybe we could update our profiles? We can't even search for jobs (yet that's available on the iPhone?) if I were you I would fix this quick before you turn into the next ""my space""...Facebook came around with the same concept and better user interface. I'll stay with you until 1.)a better site comes along or 2.) YOU FIX YOUR MAJOR ISSUES HERE",1
2013-04-24 16:34:12,Hate it.,"The Vers 6.0 upgrade is terrible.  I have LinkedIn on two iPhones.  I will NOT upgrade this app on the second phone.   It highlights junk ( individual updates) that I don't want, would exclude if I could.  It makes the good stuff, finding info about someone harder.  This gets one star because zero isn't an option.

Please go back to the previous UI.  I don't want to use this one.  I may delete the mobile app if there is no other choice.  I could get by with using LinkedIn on my desktop.",1
2013-04-02 17:03:28,"Missing key functions, confusing interface","My excitement over the new app quickly turned to frustration and disappointment. The navigation is very confusing, and the main function I use all the time-- my contacts-- is buried within one's  profile with no way of easily searching them.  There seem to be all sorts of additional pages of content that I am not going to use, while I can't use the ones I need.",2
2013-02-08 02:56:11,Who in Marketing killed this app?,"This App is more interested in pushing its greatness, not its functionality.  When you use this app, it is slow, cumbersome, and scattered.  It is sad that the web version on a tiny mobile screen is better.  In addition, once it has started putting notifications on my start up screen to tell me message that was really a pop up ad, I deleted it immediately.  I just keep it now to see if it gets fixed.  If I could give it a negative star rating, I would.",1
2012-12-20 06:20:28,This version keeps crashing,"I have the latest version and it has shut down three times tonight when I was searching for colleagues using my iPad. I could not enter names in the search box without the app freezing, flashing, and then shutting down back to the icon. This does not happen on the iPhone. I performed the exact operation on my phone and it worked perfectly.  I have had zero problems with earlier versions and loved the app. Am hoping this is fixed so I can give a stronger rating.",1
2012-07-01 00:16:30,Disappointing,"I installed this app many moons ago.  When I click on a link from a LinkedIn email, the app does not open taking me to the page.  Instead I am asked if I want to download the app.  Keep waiting for this to be rectified.  Does not show linked friends' email addresses but instead opts to email them for me which I may not always want to do.  App is not very useful except to see who is in my network but I already know who those folks are.",2
2012-03-15 01:50:08,Newbie but liking it,I just graduated from college and have had my account at LinkedIn for over a year. I just now am realizing the benefit of updating my account and keeping tabs on people. Definitely going to be a great tool in the future!,5
2011-11-25 00:48:53,"Smooth, intuitive and quick",A great tool for various business needs on the go.  Elegant interface and effective navigation.  Thousands times better than previous iPhone app and current Bberry app for the most important tool in a business owner's social media tool belt.,5
2011-10-21 23:54:36,Bottom line... I actually use the LinkedIn app now,"Bottom line... I actually use the LinkedIn app now.  The only thing it's missing is a cleaner UI.  They've done an AWESOME job incorporating most of the features of the online site, it just feels a bit overwhelming when opening the app for the first time.  That said, incredibly low learning curve...  4/5 Stars",4
2017-09-08 12:42:50,Lovin' it,"It's really become the career social network with impact on how I navigate professional contacts. I certainly don't mix professional contacts into my personal social network profiles. So, with the recent updates, I love what I am able to do in LinkedIn!",5
2011-04-16 14:48:08,No Groups Support,"I would give up the ability to do anything else with this app if I could see and manage my groups. 

I work on the computer all day, and would love to be able to kick back and look at the groups on my phone instead of having to drag out the laptop. LinkedIn is such a great network! We need this!",3
2010-01-09 04:20:54,"Not that bad, could be better","To turn on connection updates, go to iPhone Settings, LinkedIn, then for Visible Network Updates, turn Connection on. That's it.

There needs to be a way to clear the new connection count alert without adding them to your iPhone address book. Not that big a deal, but it looks silly.",3
2017-08-25 03:46:17,Helpful and Friendly,"The LinkedIn app encourages users to stay in touch with their connections by wishing them happy work anniversaries and birthdays. Messages are pre-crafted, and are customizable. The pre-crafted messages are helpful for busy professionals like me. It continues to be helpful even a year later.",5
2017-06-29 20:17:59,It works!,"Social Media is all over the place, and many online communities have lost their purpose - NOT LINKED IN. It still serves business-minded individuals and companies on the Internet.

UPDATE: The things you suggested didn't work.  I tried to contact you via the address you gave me and my phone wouldn't go to the site. I reinstalled it today and I was really hoping it would go back to working properly, but it did not. I really want this app to work.",1
2017-01-25 02:02:57,Convenient and user friendly,"Love the LinkedIn app. It's very user friendly and convenient to keep in touch with all the professional and personal connections. I also enjoy all the useful articles that I can read, learn from and share. Keep it up!",5
2017-04-29 19:30:12,Notifications are ridiculous,"While the LinkedIn platform is useful, this app has a serious problem with bombarding you with notifications. I have every notification option turned off, yet the badge counter continues to show notifications. All. Day. Long. It's incredibly annoying to open the app and see that, yet again, there's nothing of importance about which to be notified, yet notified it does anyway. One star until the company rethinks its notifications.",1
2015-09-01 13:26:11,Flawed Interface,"Due to a flawed mobile functionality - an errant hand movement automatically sent invitations to connect to everyone of LinkedIn's ""suggestions"" - whether appropriate or not.  This was extremely upsetting.  There was no dialog box/warning saying ""are you sure"" or any kind of fail-safe/safety measure.  This I find is a major flaw.",4
2017-01-24 18:40:19,Fast and Targeted,"This app keeps getting better.  The functions are quick, and targeted to the most useful networking activities.

There are multiple red dot notifications for the same thing in several different places, then when you click that section there is a bunch of irrelevant information. The layout makes no sense. The old app had similar to logic to the website which makes much more sense. Unusable at this point.",1

2015-12-16 16:04:39,Hate this update!! 0 Stars.,LinkedIn get it together. This latest update is so awful I'm considering taking it off my phone and sticking to desktop only (unless you plan on screwing that up too). No...I'm not going to download multiple apps for 1 site. I hated it when Facebook did it and have no idea how that's still around.  This entire experience is clunky and irritating and I haven't talked to 1 person that disagrees and we are all young and tech savvy so that's not the problem. Please change it!,1
2015-12-07 07:53:09,Suggested contacts are a dead man's party,"When I dismiss a suggested contact in the LinkedIn Mobile App, I don't appreciate that it comes back an hour or a day later.  On one marathon session I dismissed over a hundred contacts I didn't know only to have them reappear later. Like my dead mother, for instance. I am not kidding.

2015-12-02 08:42:13,Compliments desktop LinkedIn,I think that desktop LinkedIn is better than mobile LinkedIn. I should be able to do everything I do on desktop LinkedIn in mobile LinkedIn but I cannot right now. But still a good compliment to desktop version.,5
2015-12-02 04:54:10,Great improvements!,"I loved the experience of using the LinkedIn app already, but the new organization is great; the feel of the app is much more friendly.

2015-01-07 15:40:14,Buggy and poor experience,"LinkedIn is one of the worst iOS apps out there.  Clearly it was written for the browser/PC versus written for Mobile first.  It is very buggy for example try to address a note, the search function for the contact hangs up and isn't intuitive if you don't type the exact name.  You need to scrap it and write the app for Mobile first ground up with some new mobile first developers.
The latest 8.3 doesn't even let me send messages to all of my contacts.",1
2014-02-14 01:49:47,Great networking tool,Over the past year I have come to the conclusion that I check LinkedIn more than any other social media site.

The profile view in landscape mode doesn't seem to respond at all when scrolled.  There needs to be much simpler interface controls, there doesn't seem to be a. Unifying interface theme throughout the app.  I'm surprised so many people gave this one high marks, I expect more from a big player in the social media game.",2
2017-08-07 16:54:02,Excellent Networking App,"This is fantastic for business if it is used properly. LinkedIn premium is definitely worth it if you are in between roles. Only complaint, it is too easy to ""accidentally"" connect with people when swiping through people and there is no way to undo the invitation.",4
2012-04-18 02:54:45,LinkedIn Fan,I have been promoting LinkedIn as the premier professional networking social media program for a long time.  The new app just makes it easier to stay connected with my ever changing network.  Great app and great use of social media.,5
2012-04-08 21:49:59,"Awesome: Super intuitive, simple & beautiful --  best networking app on store","This app us super intuitive, simple & beautiful  

Intuitive:
Features are easy to navigate; great UI & user experience.

Simple:
The home screen has 4 buttons; although LinkedIn has a ton of functionality, the app was distilled down to what's most relevant & most crucial while on the go.  No extra fat.  Easy to find people & groups, send/read messages and access the news via LI today.

Beautiful:
Great design.  Much better looking than other social utility apps.  Good transitions between features.",5
2012-01-25 14:07:32,Pop-up messages are obnoxious,"Nice interface, but you get a weekly push notification to ""check what's happening on LinkedIn this week."" This is obnoxious and annoying and I was being charitable by seeing if I could disable these messages first via Settings before deleting the app. Apparently there is no way to block these intrusive pop-ups, so I finally just deleted the app.",2
2011-08-30 16:47:00,New version is great!,I like the new version of the app a lot better than the old one. I like that I can see my groups and read discussions. And the layout looks better too. I can't understand why some users would want to go back to the old version.,5
2011-08-21 13:11:03,Awesome update!!,"The LinkedIn app just went through a fantastic update!!! I love the new look and organization of the app. The only suggestion I have is to allow users to edit their profiles from the app. It may be possible, but I haven't figured out how to do it yet.",5
2011-08-19 14:37:37,LinkedIn Fail,"LinkedIn was a way to keep track of business/ professional associates on the while on the go. The current update looks fine but removes all functionality.  I can no longer respond to my messages, can no longer get to my list of contacts without going through multiple screens that were not needed before.   B+ for look of new app, D- for functionality. Here is hoping they fix it soon.",2
2008-12-22 08:06:56,Could do more ,"This app has all the basics: search, network updated, contact list, etc. Would be nice if it let you accept invited from the app. Should also let give you the same options when adding a connection as you do online (the ""how do you know"" feature is missing). Otherwise, it works well.",3
2017-08-31 16:32:33,Awesome App,"It provides a much easier and more navigable experience, than using the website on my phone.

And I see less Ads than I do on the website, since there is no ad sidebar.  It causes less distractions as I read my contacts' posts.",5
2017-08-19 19:22:45,Love it,LinkedIn is basically my CRM and Database so I use the platform constantly. Love the functionality and especially excited about the option to use video as a posting medium. Keep up the great work. Looking forward to the outlook integrations that I hope are forthcoming.,5
2017-08-04 09:30:36,Does not work in landscape mode,Convenient way of keeping up to date with your LinkedIn contacts when not in front of a desktop. But tough to read picture posts containing not-so-large fonts. Would be quite helpful if the app could be viewed in landscape mode as well.,4
2017-06-30 03:24:53,Great business platform,We must all learned to use each app appropriately. Therefore LinkedIn is a business app that can either network you with like thinking or network with you with your next big step in your career. Make good use of it!!!,5
2017-05-11 05:55:36,Easier than ever,While it seems that the business model is changing and a few of the free features are disappearing and being migrated to the the subscription side. The remaining free features have been simplified and made easier to use.,5
2017-05-26 20:13:10,What a hassle,"When you open the app, it requires you to do too many things before taking care of what you opened the app to do.  Connect to this person, new feature that, swipe for more of this, and the frustration continues. There's nothing you can do to skip all of it.   With any luck this will be corrected in the near future.  Until then, I have better things to occupy my time with, so do you",2
2017-03-02 03:14:14,Best app for professional growth!!,LinkedIn has provided me an amazing platform to grow my business connections and to expand my reach. I highly recommend using this app and the premium membership to take your professional life to the next level.,5
2017-04-02 05:51:39,Incredibly annoying user experience.,"I only open the linkedin app once every couple weeks to accept connection invites. Everytime I open it and more than a few weeks have gone by, it forces me to go
through a list of tour items to reconnect with people and find people to follow. I don't want to follow anyone or connect with random people. I just want to open the app and click a single button to accept an invite. I don't want to waste my time with this other stuff.",1
2017-01-27 03:06:44,Ability to Share,"Collaboration and Sharing. LinkedIn provides an platform to converse, learn, and gain perspective.  A perfect platform for sharing professionals. Sometimes knowing there is a place that is always open around the world and local makes all of more effective.",5
2016-10-20 03:00:42,Use it all the time,"I love this app I use it all the time. It provides me with very specific information and I feel it's more advanced than others like it. This app doesn't ever shut down randomly, or repeat posts like some do.  I also like the alerts",5
2016-12-17 17:13:18,Secretly Removed Features,"What they didn't tell you about the ""general bug fixes and performance improvements"" was that they were also removing features from the app as well.  I never would have upgraded if I had known.

They removed the ""Unfollow"" feature from the home screen.  If you didn't want to see everything some people post or share on your home screen, this was a great feature.

Thanks for making LinkedIn just like Facebook!!",1
2016-07-29 14:24:34,Badge Alerts and Notifications aren't accurate,"Badge alerts: the number says ""2"", I go into the app to see what's up and nothing.

Notification of a new connection. Go to the app to see them. Nothing. No notice or direction that I had a new connection. So if I don't respond to a notification, I have to dig thru my connections to see whose new. 

These two items don't align with my experience inside the app! Been like this for way too long!",2
2015-12-14 19:08:34,Why so many bad reviews?,"I would consider myself a ""normal"" user of LinkedIn, meaning I use it casually or when I need to. This update seems to be an improvement to me. I'm knocking off a star because the initial update to this new version kept crashing on open. I reinstalled it and it seems to be working fine now.",4
2016-06-01 02:00:53,Nice,I often find myself annoyed by websites that feel the need to create an app to view the same content I could browse using safari or chrome. This is one of the few such apps that I actually enjoy using. Highly recommended.,5
2016-05-25 03:59:07,A convenient way to keep up with colleagues,"Having given my Facebook account up over fears of identity theft, LinkedIn is so much more secure and convenient. Because it's business-oriented, I don't have to wade through people's status updates, superfluous requests, pokes, etc.",5
2016-02-12 13:59:46,Too different from desktop site,"For a short time the LinkedIn app looked and felt a lot like the regular desktop site that we hard-core users had come to like. Now the app is very different again leaving both rather hard to use and correlate. Stop redesigning and just give us a nice, simple representation of our feed, messaging, notifications, etc.",3
2016-01-05 14:59:37,2 big requests,"The folks at LinkedIn don't give any way to submit feedback or feature requests so I'll try it here. If I could get two changes on the app, the group posts should show all entries in chronological order. Option for popular discussions. Now it's some weird subset. Second, give us a Create Post button when we are in a group!! Outrageous it isn't there. Thanks for reading and providing the biggest professional online network. Definitely still a tremendous value.",1
2015-03-04 14:47:26,Crash after update fix,Uninstall app and re-install App. The only way I could get the app to work again. It works fine now and the update actually works well in the iPhone 6. I wish the developers would have given instructions as to uninstall and reinstall the App in order to work.,4
2015-12-11 18:03:52,As Good an App as Any,I have no idea where all the horrible reviews are coming from. This app is as clean and easy to use as any. Performs the basic functions with ease. The bad reviews must come from people who are technologically challenged or from those who use LinkedIn very intensively.,5
2015-12-09 02:46:07,Time to reorg your development team,"This new version is in one word ... HORRIBLE!  Management, please look at your development team and put Quality Control in place as well as make sure you beta this before it goes out.  You actually took functionality away from the previous version so I'm now going in through the website and leaving this app in the dust, tucked in a folder never being used hoping one day you'll clean it up and at the least .... Do regression testing.  Yeesh .... HORRIBLE!",1
2015-09-18 21:59:33,Poor IOS support.,Clicking on email links sent from LinkedIn to my Gmail on IOS devices rarely works.  Click on an attached link back to LinkedIn and you get directed to the LinkedIn site and the app just stalls.  It often won't open the link I received in the email.  I have written to their support about it several times.  They just wont fix it.  This is a business app that isn't ready for prime time - not on IOS devices.,2
2015-09-03 11:58:53,Does not play well with other apps.,"Typically, I'll get a notification via email (GMail app on my iPhone) about a discussion, a new connection request, that people have viewed my profile, etc. If I click the link provided, it opens Chrome and then opens the LinkIn app, which might or might not open the discussion I'm trying to get to. Half the time the app just hangs, wasting my time.",3
2015-05-13 16:27:45,Adding updates is very hard,"The text box for updates is so tiny, and almost impossible to navigate on an iPhone. I have to use notepad to compose my updates and insert the links, but when I paste the system doesn't recognize the link and only posts a truncated version of the link and not the image and the title of the article I'm trying to share.",3
2015-03-18 00:24:01,Still learning my way around...,Became a LinkedIn member a few years ago. I can see and sense the power of this social engine. My problem – too many things on my agenda and not enough time to explore. Thanks LinkedIn! You're definitely in my to do list.,5
2014-06-09 03:37:16,Confusing but valuable tool,"The idea behind LinkedIn -- a professional networking website -- is amazing, but it's layout and interface can be cumbersome and confusing, especially on smartphones. Overall, a great tool that could maybe be a bit more user-friendly at smart-phone level.",4
2015-01-15 01:23:56,Stable but....,Although over the past couple of years most of the major bugs have been resolved making this app stable it still lacks some basic features like having to log in from an link in my email or more intuitive navigation.   On a brighter note each build is incrementally better then before.,3
2014-08-27 23:26:45,Overall happy,"I think the app works great -   except for new activity. When someone requests a new connection, there are too many hoops to jump through. And, I think the ""endorsements"" are an absolute waste of time. I've been endorsed for things I know nothing about...",5
2014-08-07 16:56:15,Decent,I would like more functionality out of this application. I like the way updates look when you provide a link. I dislike the very limited information provided when you click on someone's profile. Not being able to edit your profile is weak too. I give it a 2.5 but rounded up in homes this billion dollar company steps up.,3
2014-07-30 14:50:09,Notification problem on iphone,"After the last update, no notifications are active.  Inside the app everything is selected but in the notification center or main settings page you can't find the app to select the notifications options.  I am receiving messages and notifications and the only way I find it is by receiving an email... Bug needs to be fixed asap",2
2014-07-04 03:51:15,I feel linked in to tech,"With linkedin I am very connected to the pulse of the developer community and I receive a lot of interest and learn about great opportunities at many great businesses. I love LinkedIn. The app is the icing on the cake, with the ability to chat with recruiters and quickly learn about my colleagues.",5
2014-04-21 16:40:23,Complete Professionals App,"If you are looking for a app for professional networking then this is it. It's got all areas covered like job openings, company profiles and various influential professionals on your fingertips. You even have the feature to endorse your connections for their skills. I use this app quite often and I highly recommend it!",4
2014-04-23 22:29:22,Easy navigation and interface,I enjoy using this app on the go! It's similar to the desktop version making it easy go move around and it can access your phone contacts to find connections too! Great job developers.,5
2012-03-26 12:53:39,Complements Web Site Very Well,Navigation is a breeze and extremely powerful functionality packed into a mobile app. Others have already noted the lack of profile editing. I don't consider that a hindrance - yet. But it will be as we transition into the post-PC era. Otherwise it's a well-done app.,4
2014-04-16 16:09:49,Professional it is,"It's time for us to change the way we  manage our personal network to a professional one. 

solution. Passing that information should be digitally seamless. on is built on two simple ideas.
1. Contact information can be conveniently shared with people who matter.
2. Passing that information should be digitally seamless. 
LinkedIn has done a great job. The app itself has to now be geared to the times and modernized.  We need to see the above features added. I will be happy 2 provide details of how the above can be improved.",5
2014-04-12 15:10:42,"Great site, great app","LinkedIn is great for networking and the mobile version is great. If you have an upgraded account, the mobile version doesn't carry over all of the features, but it keeps most of the overall functionality.",5

2013-09-05 11:41:04,Very good app- thankful for it!,"I love this app. Love it and I am on it aaallll the time. It is very comfy to use and i even apply for jobs through this app!!!! This is how comfortable it is. 

BUT the thing that bugs me for months now is the way they correlate with emails. 

When i get an email notification - i click on the link in it and it doesn't go to the APP. It goes to a stupid website which i don't want to login to!!!!! All the time . 

Cant just it be going to the app directly from the email... I mean isn't it so obvious to do? 

Not happy with that at all. I have to open the app then and i loose notification or i have to search for it in the app. 

2 stars down for that. Very uncomfortable.",3
2013-08-19 17:47:33,Great for networking tool,"Easy to use application.  When I look at someone's profile it speaks volumes to me how assertive they are with their profile (ie updated, recommendations by others, helpful information about the individual).  It help to gain a better image about the person.",5
2013-08-01 19:41:32,Like no other!,I haven't found any other network with the amount of resources and connections like this one. The filters used by the system to limit the amount of non desired contacts or connections is outstanding. I strongly recommend LinkedIn.,5
2013-07-05 22:21:22,Very rudimentary,If they put 10% of the amount of effort in creating the custom view controllers and aesthetics this app would have been usable without using a curse word every time you open it. If LinkedIn can't figure out how to use app links in the junk emails they send us they shouldn't be in a web service business. None of the features have a flow and work intuitively. It's a shame Stanford used LinkedIn developers on their iOS course for guest lecturers. Form is not important than functionality.,1
2013-04-19 00:05:00,Multiple Problems,"This Ap constantly crashes.  A real pain in the neck!  I even deleted the Ap, then re-installed it & updated the Ap as required hoping to fix this problem with no success.
When I try to connect with someone, it will not allow me to do so.
On several occasions, others have accepted invitations from me when I know I did not send them a request to connect.
More & more, I go to the website & do not use this Ap.",2
2013-02-19 12:58:19,LinkedIn Today Section Drives Me Bonkers,"I see an article in the updates section from the home screen that looks interesting and really want to read, I tap to go in and then that article GOES AWAY and they update/shuffle around. This happens every time! Please just make it stop. It's frustrating enough to make me stop using the app because I can do everything else just the same on the website. Please look into this....thanks!",2
2012-10-19 23:29:19,Hello? iPhone 5 support please.,"What respectable publicly traded company that specializes in professional social media and boasts over 100m users can't even release an app update to support the iPhone 5? 

LinkedIn... That's who. This app stinks. You'd think they'd want to keep their mobile users happy, but this is tragic. On top if a lack of iPhone 5 display support, it can be almost impossible to send messages to contacts. 

If you're beholden to shareholders the you best get it together and release apps that actually work and function properly.",1
2012-08-10 14:41:46,"Some bad, some good","I really like the interface and the organization. Easy to find people, send notes, and connect.

It crashes at certain points in the app, needs to be fixed. There is no ability to edit your profile in the app. I would like a verification pop-up before a connection request is sent.

Definitely close, but needs work.",3
2012-05-09 11:44:44,Meh,"If they cant get my iPhone to work on the website, why would I want an app of theirs on my phone?  I tried to use the website, and it redirects to the mobile version, which just sits there 'loading'. Pretty useless. Never gets to an option to use the real website. I don't care that there is an app for that, since there was already a website! Now I have more crap on my phone and have to learn *another* interface.",2
2017-08-19 13:41:55,Great platform great app,"LinkedIn is an amazing platform instead and the iPhone app makes using LinkedIn simple, convenient, and enjoyable. There some features that are not fully available on the mobile app like certain settings which gets annoying. But overall it's a great product!",4
2011-11-06 18:43:08,Better by far than the website,"Smooth as glass, and a very different and unique interface. Different from the site and better for it, because it puts the options you want right now, right here, on any given screen.",5
2011-07-09 20:08:15,Creates Duplicate Address Book Entries - More Pain than Gain,"This app has caused me more pain than it is worth.

When adding a contact in LinkedIn, the app adds that contact to my address book on my iphone, thereby creating duplicate contact entries. I like to have a nicely maintained address book, and I don't want any help with it.
 
I could not find a way to deactivate this despite looking every where in the app and in the settings menu. If there is a way, still not good: it should be more easily and obviously accessible. Also, this ""mess up one's address book""- function should not be on by default. 

Bottom Line: Not good. The convenience of having an app for this is outweighed by having to go back and clean up my address book. Deleted the app. Will just use the web-interface in the future.",1
2008-08-21 04:33:56,I wished for other and I got it,"Just yesterday I was searching for this app and today it's here. I am not going to comare it with the web version though I expect some pro features implemented. Please add updating profiles - one star for it. Fix the invite issue - another star for it.

I am really glad that LinkedIn is now on my iPhone wherever I go. This is great.",3
2017-08-05 13:13:26,An exceptional social media,LinkedIn gives a new meaning to the trends of social media. Not only does it provide individuals a place to explore career paths but it also invites them to read and write about their professional expertise. It is a one stop shop for building communities and expanding professionalism.,5
2017-07-24 17:29:05,I really hate one thing about this app,"So, in fairness, this is a pretty good app once you get past the 96 million steps of the intro EVERY TIME you open it. I don't want to go through connection suggestions or whatever else is in there when I want to read a message or look someone up. Why would anyone trying to serve a community of professionals design an app that wastes my time like this? Get rid of this annoyance and the app would get 4 or 5 stars. This BS feature takes it down to 1. Vent over...",1
2017-04-21 21:49:31,"They add secret ""features"" without telling you","One of the latest updates tries to connect to other Bluetooth devices nearby without any mention in the update description. Just google Rik Ferguson and Vocativ for more info if you don't believe me. The app was already pretty questionable about always, ALWAYS trying to get at your contacts in your phone and email. I the default should be that *I* decide who my business contacts are. I don't need my mom as a LinkedIn contact!",1
2017-04-06 14:51:39,Great for business and networking,I have find myself using this app daily. I have read articles on here that I would have never looked up on my own that have really helped me professionally. This app has helped me increase my network capabilities.,5
2017-03-02 02:09:29,Best professional networking social app out there!,Love the new version with the ability to write blogs and share news and information on our industry. It's primarily technology heavy but definitely useful for all verticals. Best way to build your professional network.,5
2017-03-16 12:08:17,Too many notifications,"Love LinkedIn and the app works great. But it drives me absolutely insane to get so many notifications about birthdays, work anniversaries, profile updates, etc. I have an All-Star profile with over 600 connections so you can imagine how often I get notified. Why can't we just control which items notify us?? I don't want to turn off all the notifications, just the ones I don't find useful. Thanks",2
2017-02-24 10:49:59,Best social media platform,I've deleted all other social media applications but this one. I find that I feel better after reading articles and seeing friends on LinkedIn. Great for connecting with your career and connecting with likeminded people in your industry.,5
2016-11-22 05:59:44,Love this business networking app,Loving this all as it's navigable. Easy to search and review profiles. I enjoy the articles that's shared and the groups we can join.   It can definitely expand our resources in our field of work and increase our connections. Love this app,5
2016-10-01 01:39:26,Perfect mobile version,Works perfectly for its purpose. Just as functional as the desktop edition in my opinion. Latest update seems to have fixed any log in problems I was having before.,5
2016-09-19 15:49:19,"Useful, fun to explore, educational","I think people who have more negative things to say about LinkedIn *may be taking meaningful work and relationships too seriously! (;-). Visit this app often and connect a little, learn, have fun. Go for more advanced features, if you like.",5
2016-08-18 00:07:51,Great App!! Ease of use,"I personally use this app on a daily basis. I love every aspect in it. I read so many helpful and useful articles daily from people whom are expert in different fields. I love the feature that shows who viewed my profile, which makes me feel important. Great App Great Job",5
2016-06-23 01:19:10,Easy to connect,"There are several options to use Linked In, the apps is the most easy and convenient one to have! The opportunity to navigate and connect with people become more enjoyable by using this app!",5
2016-06-29 17:11:17,Missing crucial component!,"The app is fine overall, though I'm frustrated with the notifications, or lack there of. Unlike the desktop version, the app doesn't allow you to see who has accepted your requests to connect. I only see that my number of connections has increased. Thus I'm continually forced to log on the computer, basically defeating the purpose of having and/or using the app. Please change this!",2
2016-04-26 14:09:33,Necessary App for Business Relationship Building,"I love the LinkedIn app and highly recommend it to any business person for building and maintaining strong relationships. I use this app daily to connect with my network, which has resulted in stronger relationships and increased business.",5
2016-06-19 20:35:58,Buggy,"The app is functional, but it's pretty annoying to continually get notifications about someone sending me a message over and over again. I get a new notification every day for a message that was left about a week ago and I've already read. This happens all the time, unfortunately. 
Maybe Microsoft can improve the app. Hope so.",3
2016-06-18 17:57:23,Good for basic searching,"This app is a good clean way to digitally present your resume to pretty much anyone who has the interest in employee searching. In career counseling, we actually spend 45 minutes discussing linked in. That's really the beginning and ending of the counseling now. Without a solid linked in presence, your not on the spectrum digitally to ""know your stuff"" as a professional in a millennial world.",3
2016-04-26 13:44:08,LinkedIn stepped up to the plate,"I'm super impressed with how much better this app has become. It finally up there with FaceBook and I feel it surpasses Instagram for sure. It's become a power tool now just for business, but also for social networking. Way to go LinkedIn..!!🔥👊😎🔥",5
2015-12-17 06:37:50,Clean and user friendly,I don't normally review apps but have just been drawn to LinkedIn again and again after this new release. Everything makes sense to me and it is a great way to gain access to people and news in my industry. Well done!,5
2016-03-16 22:52:56,Confusing and often annoying,"This app and entire social app leaves much to be desired. It had great potential when I first downloaded but now, I receive more information and contacts via email than through the app. If I wanted to flood my email, I would have signed up for that! Make this workable or I'm deleting to create more storage on my devices.",3
2016-02-19 13:54:22,LinkedIn needs more integration,"LinkedIn apps need more integration. They shouldn't need multiple apps. Everything should be accessible through one app (network, jobs, articles, etc). It's too fragmented. Same goes with their desktop websites. Mail and messages from the standard LinkedIn, sales navigator, Etc should be integrated with one's regular non premium version.",3
2016-01-17 17:22:22,"One of the best, now the worst","I don't review very many apps, But this one is special.  Since the UI update, this app is pretty much useless and is absolutely horrible.  You guys seriously just need to go back to the way it was.  I get push notifications but can't find what they were.  I'm about to delete the app and just use the web version.  Completely awful.  It was one of my favorite apps now its the worst.  With 2 overall stars, LinkedIn obviously is not listening to users at all.",1
2015-12-10 07:23:54,Cuts off experience section,"This new version puts the 'See More' link below Education instead of below the experience - for most people it looks like the first 5 lines are the only experience they have.  The 'see more' link should be placed below experience, THEN put education.  This is very confusing and cuts off a lot of information for people who have a lot of valuable experience.  Otherwise the redesign is quite nice.",2
2015-12-04 13:01:40,Poorly done,"Why did you try to fix something that wasn't broken??!  Now I can't view my profile views, nor can I view or get to all of my groups or companies that I follow.  When I have a new connection, I have to figure it out by combing through my existing connections. I also have to perform several clicks just to get to anything whereas the previous app was 1-2 layers.  Very poorly done. I will use my laptop before using this terrible app. Hope you change it back asap.",1
2015-11-03 21:38:04,Great app but learning curve is a bit steep,"Like many other comprehensive apps, LinkedIn could use some overview documentation for new users. It's hard to blame them for the lack because almost no other apps provide such help to users. So we will continue to muddle through. Over all, it seems to be a powerful  and useful app.",4
2015-12-02 19:39:26,MUCH easier to use,The new card format for handling connection requests and news items is OUTSTANDING!!  It now takes seconds to process my queue where it took several minutes before. Excellent UX design has moved this from a 2.5-star app to a 5-star app.,5
2015-11-17 16:08:26,Pointless excercise in self promotion,"Nice design but zero real world use. Seems to be a place for people desperate to get noticed by ""connecting"" with largest amount of past acquaintances from past jobs. 
No real push for allowing to look for jobs higher than current tier nor opportunities for honest discussions (since everyone is afraid to hurt their career options).
Pointless and not really entertaining. 
Recent addition of ads makes it a spam app.",2
2015-11-10 01:56:37,Navigation,"This is one of those ""necessary evil"" services. You feel like everyone in business is using it, so you have to as well. And really, that's fine. It's not a bad app. The constant badgering to rope more friends in is VERY tedious, but I get it. Free service has a cost. That said, i don't use it much. Too much of a pain to have to sign in so often. Seriously, take a cue from the competition. Leave me signed in unless I tell you otherwise. Or hey, how about Touch ID?",2
2015-07-29 19:50:26,Strong networking/contact base tool,This platform brings lots of value to the professional and networking world. The only caveat is that when I click on a person's picture in my notifications it doesn't bring me to their page. Also sometimes going backwards in the app erases my last actions.,4
2015-09-07 14:13:41,Phenomenal App for business development!,"I would give this 10 stars if I could. The suite of apps and remind you and encourage you to keep making contact - makes this a phenomenal business development tool!

I hope keep adding features to this - to make it more user friendly to manage contacts as well.

The pop ups gives instant access to reading messages and adding contacts - simple search and messaging makes this app always stay open and on my first page of apps on any device I own.

Thanks LinkedIn!!!",5
2015-09-03 23:47:14,You are not a professional unless you have this app,"This app is simple. Easy to use and intuitive. I love how simple it is to keep up with my professional world on my phone.

This is great tool to say connected and drive new business development efforts. I have been on Linked In since May, 2010.. It is a Powerful Tool for Professionals.

2015-07-16 13:21:52,Great but poor mobile interface.,LinkedIn has really helped me in my professional life. It gives me a way to track my progress and provides me feedback that I would never get otherwise. The mobile app is not very straight forward. The left notifications menu especial needs help.,4

I go to the app, the notice about the group update is nowhere to be found!  Seriously, if Facebook can do this, LinkedIN, you should be able to do this...

Wouldn't use this if I could use it 100% in browser on iPad, but there are issues with posting that are stupid...

All in all needs better integration and testing,",5
2015-02-15 19:52:27,Can't add photos,I don't like the fact that in the app you can't add a photo to your page for promoting your business or for networking events..

2014-10-29 13:59:57,Disconnectedness,"I can't understand why, after downloading the LinkedIn app to my mobile device, why, when opening emails sent to my mobile device, LinkedIn gives me the page suggesting I download their mobile app.

Don't you folks use your stuff?  Can't you figure out when a person clicks on a LinkedIn email link that they either do or don't have the mobile app, and respond accordingly?

Your mobile and email channels are not connected.  That's hard to accept.",1

2014-05-16 11:52:09,Good but some things missing,Need to integrate add a pic in the mobile version. Need to integrate software opening from Gmail link. Most importantly: Need realistic suggestions for improving visibility that are tailored to your specific sector. These suggestions will not only improve each individual's visibility but more importantly the real value of LinkedIn,4
2014-06-03 13:54:04,Works well,"The LinkedIn App performs well. Does not crash, and it allows contact searches, connecting with people, responding to requests to connect and communicating with connections. The app's notifications when people invite you to connect work well. Great job.",5
2014-05-28 17:17:04,Great app,This app is very easy to use and connects you to tons of people in your line I work and others who are not.  I have been able to connect with people all over the world which has helped in finding a job much easier.,5
2014-04-26 04:06:30,Seems Decent,I use this app very little and only for professional connections however I have not had any problems other than I do not like that it ask me often to invite people to connect  from my contacts list this gets annoying after a while.,4
2013-11-08 10:27:56,Good way to network,"App keeps me in touch with previous connections. Sometimes the email button shows I have a message and it won't take me there. Recommendations are helpful to ""poke"" someone you haven't connected with in awhile. I've never actually gotten an interview through the app. Overall, it's good, though.",4

2014-02-04 02:54:20,Great Tool - Mediocre App,"The LinkedIn App deserves 5 stars simply because of the edge it provides in all facets of pursuing a successful career. The App is necessary for anyone who is serious about their future, although in my opinion it does not do justice in comparison to LinkedIn via a web application on a larger operating system.",5
2014-01-09 17:38:54,An investment worth making,The app is user friendly for my smart phone. The feature that allows me to customize my message to connect are a primary concern. Connecting with someone in a timely manner makes this app worth the memory it reserves on my phone.,5
2013-12-15 10:34:51,So disappointed in this app,"After all of these updates, you would think that it would be improvements! It still does not load ""who's viewed my profile"", you still can't do specific searches...it's just a waste to even have the app. The only good purpose this does is to immediately add a new connection when you meet them right away. It's almost not even worth having such a large app on your phone, because you can't even be productive! So annoying!",1
2013-11-13 00:23:21,Getting Better,The new layout is easier to maneuver through And provides better use of the timeline of activities. I would however like to see the timeline divided between connections and business/jobs.,5
2013-04-06 13:34:57,Job Search,"Get on the ball and add the functionality for Job Search in the Jobs Group. Don't show me jobs you think that I would be interested in.

2013-07-02 04:13:09,Added Functionality,"Would love to see the inclusion of personalized recommendation for contacts through app. Also, addition of basic skill set confirmations for one's contacts.

2013-05-09 05:05:54,Pretty worthless as a mobile app,"Not being able to make updates to your profile makes this app practically worthless. I've also clicked accept on a certain connection request a dozen times, but it doesn't add the connection and gives me no reason. For such a large company, I'm shocked your mobile app is so lacking. When I saw there was an update today, I got all excited that this would be fixed....sad to see it was not. Hopefully next time!",1
2012-01-20 22:02:55,Very useful,"I like it a lot. Great for quick updates. I can get to all the things I need while I'm on the go. 

I wish the reader function worked on the browser.  That would be so much easier to power through the news without having to resize.",4
2013-02-19 17:45:44,Never works right,"I gave this app a 3/5 because profiles are viewable and the feed is too, but my messages are inaccessible. I cannot read a message again once it's been read, and that's only possible 60% of the time. When there isn't a new message in my inbox, clicking the inbox leads me to the feed... Which becomes rather frustrating and irritating.",3

I try to sign in but it hangs.  After hundreds of attempts I finally get it
To reply to a contact and I can't even see the area I am trying to write my reply in.  The menu seems to follow every we're I go and it covers everything up.

So I go back via web page and it hangs 
Up when I try to long in.

So frustrating!!!!!  Makes me wonder
How many great opportunities I have lost since I have been not able to get
Into linked in.

I use my iPhone for 80-90 % of access to Email and Internet.  My Job does not allow acess to linked in with work computers.

Great app idea but lousy implementation!!!!!!!

I wanted to give it zero stars but I was once again forced to pick at least 1

Good bye LinkedIn",1
2012-11-20 11:06:35,Awesome app,LinkedIn is one of the greatest App I've ever used. Clean and user-friendly UI is everything that makes this a perfect app. Still it crashes at some times but I can't blame the app for crashing. It crashes due to low memory on my phone. Thumbs Up to LinkedIn for this great App,5
2012-11-08 11:41:36,"Amazing new look but, -1 for no editing",Seriously??? LinkedIn spends all this money to revamp their app and no editing capability. LinkedIn - I know you're not the only one. Many apps I come across lack the exact same thing. But did you really think people wouldn't want to edit their profile straight from their iPad or other mobile devices? Love everything else about the app!,3
2012-04-26 16:08:53,Good start,"This is a good start on adapting the app to the iPad screen, but why isn't getting to my contact list a little easier? Also, I would like to see a scrollable list version of the updates (as on the web) as an alternative to making me page through the (nicely designed) updates laid out in blocks. Glad to see this update to the app in any case!",3
2011-12-17 03:58:51,Easy to use on the go,"Although this is the first time I've used the LinkedIn mobile app, I find it intuitive to use and effective to perform the most common LinkedIn tasks. I would recommend it to anyone who needs to maintain their professional network outside of the office.",4
2017-01-24 22:50:18,Very good...if more functionality were available on the mobile app,Very good...if more functionality available on the web version were available on the mobile app than it'd get a 5.  The messaging on the mobile app is way better than the web version.,4
2011-08-19 23:49:33,Keeps me connected,"After updating to the new version I can't stop using it, I really like the news section which is very simple for me to track the related news in my industry. It was a bug update comparing to the previous version.",5
2010-02-09 20:24:08,Okay but limited functionality. No groups!?,"Other than access to my inbox (which doesn't always seem to work), status updates and peoples profiles, it doesn't do much. One major hole is not being able to access groups. Groups are one of the most important parts of LinkedIn.",3
2009-12-29 03:15:02,V 3.0 Update,This is probably the best upgrade to date. Much easier to get around and many more options/access to various LinkedIn features that were not availible prior. Also a much cleaner interface. ,5
2017-08-19 01:11:50,Good app - stay in touch with professional community,"I find this App an improvement over previous versions. Easily navigated, can edit responses to notifications, see new posts on the main board, private messages and connection invites.

2017-06-08 01:28:22,LinkedIn Critical For Career Networking,LinkedIn has proven itself to be the number one application for job searching around the world.

2016-08-26 14:50:06,LinkedIn vs other media,"I think the relationships you can utilize on LinkedIn is far superior to Facebook and others because your not limited in contacts or type.

2016-07-28 02:40:45,Definite Game-Changer,I was unaware of this platform until transitioning from military service came knocking on my door.

2016-06-17 16:33:14,Literally doesn't work,"This app is one ofthe worst I have seen. It's telling me there is no internet connection... So nothing will load. It does, however, load my activity. Also, I'm writing and posting this, so clearly I have a connection. I reinstalled the app thinking it got out of date. Same thing. I cannot fathom what type of development process lacks the basic QA and testing rigor to catch something as massive as this issue. Clearly they don't care about the app, so you shouldn't either.",1
2016-05-26 22:30:00,Great business networking app,I love that I can talk to other people in the same field of work as well as reach out to those who are otherwise employed and compare notes to see how everyone else uses this app and what they do in various work situations.,5

2016-04-26 01:42:33,Good user interface,"I like this new version of the LinkedIn app.  They have done a good job of ""going mobile"" and keeping the app relevant and recent.  I don't have to go to my desktop to get stuff done and it has all of the functionality that I need.",5
2016-04-07 04:25:39,It went from ok to just bad,"Splitting the features into different apps was a horrible idea. I have to close one app to go to another app. Designers are supposed to make a user interface easier not more complicated. 

I am looking for a contact yet there is no option to find my current contacts on it. Only options to add new contacts. This app falls very short of what you can do online. Redesign it please and merge the apps up. Get it right. It's not user friendly at all.",1
2016-02-25 00:54:21,It's a useful and reliable app.,"This app is very useful and never gives me any issues with stability. It's helpful for networking and getting your name at least seen by people in your field or related fields, and it offers a great platform to show off your skills!",5

2015-11-11 15:20:45,Very disappointing!,I use LinkedIn almost religiously. The site is great. This app is a great disappointment. Crashes consistently throughout all it's revisions. It is virtually unusable. The original for iPhone worked. This doesn't and isn't worth the effort. Access the site through Safari and you'll be pleased. Avoid this mess.,4
2015-12-28 16:46:02,Old version was far more useful,"The latest version of this app is basically trying to transform a business app into a social app like facebook.   Those of us that want to use linked in for business find the new app practically useless, with an interface that is not at all intuitive and constantly links out to other apps to have any value.   I've been on LinkedIn for a long time and it's no longer a relevant app to use other than for finding people.",1
2015-12-05 01:05:41,Stop the h8,I've been looking forward to the update for a long time because I believed the last version was far too clunky and not very useful. I love all the changes and hope they carry over to the web experience,5
2015-12-04 19:32:05,Improved update but still needs video,"Th update from 12/2 is finally making this app useable.  LinkedIn has been far behind in their usability.   However, while making it much easier to upload pictures there still needs to be a way to upload video as well.  

I hope you add this feature to it soon",3
2015-12-04 02:57:08,"Close, but no cigar.","Not well done. I use the app for iPad and obviously the developers have never used one. For the uninformed, iPad users often use the device in landscape orientation, especially when said user has a keyboard add-on that can only be used in landscape. Therefore, your app, which to my limited search and sideways view of the non-existent ""settings"" option, only displays in portrait and renders the app useless for me as an iPad user. Not using this app anymore until you correct this.",1
2015-05-12 15:51:10,Great App,"I have had no problem navigating the app, creating/editing my profile as well as adding connections. They seem to do a good job with bug fixes when the app is updated.

2015-04-04 14:26:48,iPad version is buggy,"The iPhone version of this app works fine for me, but the iPad version is very buggy. It keeps asking me to join groups I've already joined, and doesn't update the group page. All I can see are posts from 2 weeks ago, even though on the iPhone or web I can see more recent ones.

2013-07-12 07:25:32,"Nice work, LinkedIn",This app brings all that is good about LinkedIn to the mobile phone. I'm spending almost equal amounts of time using LinkedIn mobile app as I do on Facebook. Getting so much more value and useful content from my LinkedIn network! Several pesky bugs to work out. I'll look forward to future updates.,4
2013-09-05 15:26:57,Still Needs bugs fixed,The issue is the iPhone app keeps showing me the comments made by people or have liked a comment and keeps notifying me for hours of that and then stops after those hours,5
2013-08-01 22:01:21,Confusing,"I get these numbers that I think tell me how many ""open items"" I have. I click on the app and it takes a long time to open. Then I chase all these icons with numbers to see what my notice was about. All very confusing.  Then they ask me to write this review and only after tell me my name is taken then don't offer me a easy way to change it.",3
2013-07-30 16:24:39,App gets stuck in screens,"The app gets stuck sometimes with no back arrow or cancel options. Happened to me twice in first 1/2 hour. First, I clicked on sign instead of join and I couldn't back out or cancel. Had to uninstall/reinstall entire app to get out. Then, when I loaded a profile picture I didn't like the one I picked but again had no option to cancel, choose again or even approve!! App is useless so far.",2
2013-07-28 17:54:50,Hate it.,"I can't tell you how many times I have checked my inbox to find out some random person ""accepted my linked in request"". It is impossible to scroll through the suggested connections without inadvertently touching someone's picture and instantly sending a friend request without the ability to cancel out. This is not only annoying but could pose a security risk. Since I can't use this on my iPad this site is pretty useless to me since I don't really visit the site on my PC.",1
2013-04-19 19:09:10,iPhone Linked In application,"The application is good and has many of the features as online version. I would give it a 5 of 5 rating if my iPhone emails linked directly to my installed Linked In application instead of an advertisement saying ""Get the Linked In application"" when I already have the application installed",4
2013-05-11 19:10:57,Constantly crashes,"In the past, it made sense to update apps whenever the publisher issued a new version. Not these days. Updates today more often fall into two categories. Either they simply have added new ways to show you ads or have f'd up what had previously worked OK. LinkedIn falls in the latter category. Earlier versions worked soso on my iPad 1, but the last two updates crash constantly. Wish I never would have updated. Basically useless app at this point.",1
2013-05-02 23:39:43,Confusing UI 😡😖,"I think the programmers did a good job implementing this app because it works well and is polished, but the UI design is horrible and confusing. Trying to figure out how to navigate the app and find certain features is a nightmare. I cannot find out how to write a recommendation in the app at all so it seems certain key features are missing. My recommendation: fire your designers but keep your programmers. Sorry for the 1 star but the UX really is that bad that it overshadows everything else.",1
2013-04-23 15:57:52,"Love the site, but app needs improvement",I cannot sufficiently comment on any posts: one way to comment will not let me scroll down and the other way won't even let me type. I cannot view other comments as well. I love LinkedIn because it connected me with people in my field and had gotten many opinions and viewpoints. All in all: the app needs some improvement.,3
2012-10-04 17:43:43,Director,"If you are in business. And are a digital citizen. This app is a no-brainer. As I write this review, I have just connected with an executive, who's details I found via the App, and through which I then connected directly. No fuss. It has allowed me to do via my mobile what I'd normally only be. Able to do via desktop. That good enough.",4
2013-04-19 02:24:46,The best networking tool,"I use this app in iPad, iPhone and Pc everyday and enjoy a great experience in all 3. This is way cooler than any social app out there as it provides meaningful and rich interaction with my professional world. Improvements have helped this app a lot but I always welcome new updates.",5
2013-01-22 23:45:47,Let's get it together!,"Come on ,LinkedIn!!!!!
Seriously, I REALLY want to use this app, but it never works. It would be nice to use the ""people you may know""without it stopping but the worst part is that now my messages don't show up for days. The news section won't move past the first page, and if by chance your lucky enough to catch it on a ""good"" day, you can't read a complete article. It won't display!  Come on....please fix this , everything else is fine, just make it work!",1
2012-05-25 15:27:42,Nice improvements!,"Before, the iPhone app was a means to inform me that I need to log in to the web interface on a proper computer. Now I can interact, review, post in a more efficient and pleasing manner - right from my iPhone. Nice. Big time saver.  This is the way apps should work. Very stabile too. Big bonus.",5
2012-07-21 05:35:28,It's a good start,I like the app and check it to use it daily. There are a couple of features I need to use it better. I need to be able to update my information through the app - profile information not just statuses. I also need to manage (i.e. remove) connections from the app. The iPad is the #1 way I do my computing any more. Thanks for considering these suggestions.,3
2012-05-06 21:33:01,What is this? News reader?!,"I want to use this application to manage my LinkedIn account, check on my colleagues. Instead it pushes to me some stupid news from people and companies I don't care.

Each new update makes it worse. Now I cannot find my groups to see what going on.

If next update won't fix this I delete it from my devices. Web page is not very convenient, but at least now I still can find info about my colleagues and groups I am interested.",1
2008-08-26 21:18:49,"Good app!! Does the essential, which is what you want",I am a very active LinkedIn user and this application does all the essential things that you do on LinkedIn. The Q&A section is not available but that may come in later updates. The application works well and has good speed even on 2G. ,4
2012-05-02 12:14:51,Looks great but...,"Seems to look and work great, but now the useful information (connection updates) are mixed in with the useless news stories, with no apparent way to suppress the information I don't want.  If I want news, I will use a news app.  Give me the control that I have when I use LinkedIn on a browser! I want the information I want, and ONLY the information I want.",3
2012-04-26 10:16:39,Settings are limited & questioning how to edit calendar,"It seems there are no edit features for your profile using this ap...would be nice to not have to use my laptop or PC to edit my profile.  Also, no know way that I can find to edit my calendar in this Ap....yet....I know how releases go...work out the bugs as complaints arise ;-)  Still glad to see an iPad ap!",3
2011-10-27 00:06:08,App is wayyyyy better than their desktop website,"This is a way better way to access LinkedIn; However,I'm still trying to figure out the benefit of being on LinkedIn though. I feel Facebook is wayyyy better way to connect with colleagues and/or networking groups. Don't understand why there isn't an IPad app though or why this company went public...",3
2011-10-04 18:16:14,Remember it's mobile,"Great mobile app... Fast and easy.  Great interface.  Easy to use.. I actually appreciate the fact that you can't make changes to your profile on a mobile device.  That would only lead to "" mobile errors"".",5
2011-09-08 14:35:40,Complete lack of functionality.,"Personally I do all my social networking from my phone. This last update has rendered linkedin useless to me unless I want to browse information. This app is pretty, but in every other way inferior to the previous version.

I sorry to rain on any developers who read this. It's a good start, but needs to be useful, especially if your website redirects us to your app. Anything less than 80% functionality simply isn't worth using.

Please improve.",1
2011-07-31 03:46:03,Whatever,Add a freaking option to clear your current status rather than only add a new one.  Thought they would have thought of this in the last 5 updates but they haven't.  Programmers must be too busy blowing their stock option money from this mega inflated IPO on drugs and hookers.  Quite a few other things this App lacks.  Amazing how two of the leading social networking sites (Facebook and LinkedIn) have two of the poorest iPhone apps.,2
2010-09-13 04:24:26,Serves its purpose,"The app itself is fairly robust and that could be considered a good or bad thing, depending on the user. The homepage is too jam-packed for my taste but the overall flow of the app is still polished. If you need to keep up on your LinkedIn profile, this is not a bad way to do so. Unless you want to update your profile, then you might be disappointed.",3
2017-07-14 18:46:25,Better than most websites turned apps,"I have been a LinkedIn member for over a decade and I am a more-than-daily user. 

I would say the app is still not quite as good as the website, in terms of functionality and usability, but it's closer than most are to successfully making that transition.",4
2017-09-07 13:40:24,Works great,"Not sure what the negative reviews are about. Haven't had click bait or too many notifications at all. You can adjust notifications and email as you like. Plus, unlike Zip Recruiter, the jobs are actually not expired or filled.",5
2017-08-24 12:53:14,Great app with a growing list of new features,"Been using the app for years now and it has always been valuable. I have used it to learn more about my industry, meet new people and even find new jobs! I'm a delighted user and love the premium experience.",5
2017-05-09 20:33:41,Only use the app,I have stopped using the LinkedIn web page altogether. The notifications don't let me forget to consistently network and update my profile because potential employers are watching!,5
2017-04-13 19:54:38,Best Professional Social Media App,"Best professional networking app yet! 

Thanks Linked-In. I have made some great contacts and have had the chance to share my background with those that make a difference! Life greatest accomplishment is the ability to connect.",5
2017-01-23 18:53:30,Great way to stay connected,"I rarely use LinkedIn from a desktop, and I'm not missing much by using my phone.  Some features seem to be missing, but the major ones I need are quick and easy to access.",5
2016-09-15 01:46:04,Great for on the go,"I use this daily to check my messages, notifications, and read articles. Works great, I wish it had as many options as the desktop version of the site, though",5
2016-10-28 22:14:45,Can't log in after latest iOS update,"After latest update, I was prompted to sign in. Keep getting a ""something went wrong"" error message when I try to log in.  Won't let me request a password.  Completely not functioning.  Aside from that, when I'm logged in, I just keep seeing articles from the same people. No variety, plus repeating updates from connections.  Not happy with this app anymore, will delete if this doesn't get addressed soon.",1
2016-10-17 01:50:16,Eh...,"The app does what it's suppose to, but there is a lot of quirks. It tells me to ""connect with 5 people from my school"" and then proceeds to show me 5 random people whose profiles do not show they went to my school. It asks me to sync my contacts CONSTANTLY. I almost always have a notification, and when I check them it's the same notifications from the last time I was on. Other than that, it does what you'd expect it to do.",2
2016-07-04 17:56:14,Marketing manager,"Great app for knowledge sharing and business learning. I used the job search app, which is separate when I needed it and it worked really well as it was set up to focus on and support that search function specifically.",5
2016-08-04 21:47:38,Group discussions are impossible to find,"I receive emails from LinkedIn notifying me of a group discussion that I want to read. When I click on the view discussion link in the email, it opens the site in chrome that I have to log into. Alternatively,  i let chrome open the app but there's no way to find said discussion. It is extremely frustrating",3
2016-08-01 13:19:29,Miserable,"I would rather drag myself up stairs 5 times to get my laptop and use the website than use this app. The notifications don't ever come through when it says  you have one, the notification history removes your most recent ones so you can't go back to access them, the newsfeed is never in chronological order so I just see a bunch of the same stuff every day, and there's so much more that makes this download a complete waste of space.",1
2016-05-10 15:57:58,Great for on the go!,"I like seeing my feed and my connections on this app, and getting notifications of who has viewed my profile as well as messages. Probably would not use this app to update my profile, which is why it loses one star for me. But overall served the purpose I expect!",4
2016-04-26 16:42:37,Improved,"I like the app better than before. Notifications, meeting contacts, featured articles, etc. has really improved the overall outlook of the app. One of the missing functionality is the ability to see the latest connections in the app.",4
2015-05-03 15:54:03,"Great, but not there yet!","I find the experience of using the App enjoyable. It is a great feel for reviewing your home page and looking at profiles. It really provides the features you need for networking on-the-go, but... The App is missing the ability to customize your connection request, the golden rule of networking!",4
2016-02-19 17:43:42,A Business Essential for Success,"There are a multitude of resources in the LinkedIn app, along with being great for job seekers/upgrading your job.  Business interactions in Group Forums, as well as Direct Connections are of great value. Like any Social site, what you put out there is what is seen! Think prudently.",5
2016-02-12 14:12:42,Solid but needs work,"LinkedIn has constantly produced quality apps and this one is no different. However it is lacking in a number of functions that users expect on mobile such as simpler ""likes"", group management, and one-click job application. Instead of building multiple derivative apps, they should focus on perfecting their bread and butter.",3
2016-02-04 16:57:40,Bring back 8.8.3,"These last few updates are terrible.  I understand the need to constantly improve your software, but some of the most basic functions have been removed.  I find myself not even using the app anymore and using my computer.  The layout of 8.8.3 was very user-friendly and FUNCTIONAL.  Please stop trying to make it bubbly and pretty and focus on adding more website functionality.  You do realize most people use smartphones more than PC's right?",1
2016-01-28 05:32:37,A must-have!  Earns a spot on my phone's home screen.,This is quite simply the only social media app that matters. Connect with valuable business contacts and help your career grow.  The app itself is clean and easy to read and keep up with what's going on.,5
2016-01-14 09:45:31,App features and privacy,"At times, when launching audio/video features in the application, the audio does not work.  Also, repeating prompts to link FaceBook contacts to LinkedIn can be annoying to those who do not want to link contacts across these social networks.  One prompt and a ""No"" should be sufficient to keep this prompt from perpetually appearing.",3
2015-12-29 00:29:59,Priceless,"This new and improved app is just about all you could ask for: accessible, user-friendly, intuitively designed and warm....all while maintaining LinkedIn's core virtues. Did LinkedIn just make an incredibly sweet offer? Hand accepted...and looking forward to an amazing ride.",5
2015-12-19 13:50:08,WORST update!!,"Hate the new update. First, the constant ""spinning wheel"" as it tries to update and the tells me ""Hmm lets try that again"" after each time a refresh doesn't work is redonc!  Its an app, it should refresh!!! Also, it's harder to find what I'm looking for. I can't just ""like"" a persons new job, I have to send a message and I have to look at jobs in a different app (touching something 2x). I'm all for change and improvement, but this last update was done for change sake, NOT the UX. Booooooo",1
2015-12-08 10:26:59,Latest update was a bad move,I disliked the latest update so much I came back to change my review.  The new update makes it harder to read the screen...that's just for starters. It's not as user friendly.  I felt that before it was easier to get things done.  For example when you found an interesting company it was easy to see what job openings they had.  You can't do that now.  I will keep using the mobile app and hopefully you don't update that.,1
2015-09-25 15:42:46,Connect Phone Number,The app works very well for what it is but I subtracted two stars due to the fact that there is a blaring bug in your program. Every Time I switch screens or start the app it asks me to connect a phone number for security. I've done it previously so this popping up over and over again is getting ridiculous. Fix it!,3
2015-08-28 12:56:08,Networking,"Actually, I really do like this program. It allows me to get in touch with other professionals in my area and outside my state. It also allows me to get together with old friends and see how they're doing and what their success story has been.",5
2015-07-29 20:45:57,Does what I should - no problems yet,"Good app- obviously doesn't do as much as the actual site on a computer would do, but it works well and notifies you when you have a message/request. Good way to check out someone's work ethic on the go.",5
2015-07-23 15:43:11,Easy and attractive app,"LinkedIn is a simple pleasant way to stay in touch with colleagues, peers and other professionals. News from contacts, groups and companies is at your fingertips.  The new app is attractive and works well on my iPhone and iPad. Very useful and valuable.",5
2015-07-17 19:45:45,President,LinkedIn has been a good tool to see what's going on in the business world whether it's in the area of your business or even to create new ideas from other industries that may fit within your own business.,5
2015-03-17 11:13:32,"Works pretty well, with some annoyances",So the LinkedIn app works fairly well.  The biggest drawback is the app isn't recognized on my device when I open an email and use a link to a LinkedIn feature - it takes me to the sign in page.  Easier overall to use the web version.,4
2015-04-08 13:08:07,Great App,The college I attend required all students to have a Linkedin account and I use and check my account daily. This app allows for quick connections and editions to my account. This has to be one of the most valuable assets for business professionals.,5
2015-03-07 00:18:06,Annoyable Fix,"Overall a very good program. I enjoy keeping up with my friends, associates and contacts. However, as previously noted when I accept a link I would expect to be taken to that persons home page...not a Un-endless list of others to link with. This seems like a reasonable expectation and fix.",4
2015-03-04 13:15:37,Immediate Crash at Start,"The latest release causes an immediate crash at start on iPad Air running iOS 8.1.3, which is the latest version available. Have deleted the App and will try to reinstall to see if that corrects the problem.

After reinstalling and logging back in to the App, it worked.

Clearly a very buggy update release that should not have been released in current state. It appears that the update is the problem and a fresh install works correctly.",1
2014-07-04 20:03:08,Best professional networking app on the market,"LinkedIn is without a doubt the best professional networking app on the market. Excellent tool for organizing your contacts, recommendations, and opportunities to expand your network within channels of communication among others in the field as well as professionals operating in varying roles across the nations too organizations and employers.",4
2015-01-23 19:28:26,Engineering Manager,"The reviews process is a waste of time. This is the sixth time I have tried to input this and each time it tells me that nickname has been taken. If that is the case, why not return to the nickname field and leave the message alone until an unused nickname is found? Alan Myers (LinkedIn) passed away several months ago and you say he has a new job and six new connections.
You need to update your records if you can!",2
2014-11-20 04:26:07,This is a great app to reach out to other people!,"It is a very easy app to navigate through and find connections from all around the world! I do recommend this app to every type of person be it business, family or friendship ties!!",5
2014-10-25 01:00:13,Wish the app stayed on my home screen,"Linked in is great, but the app is suddenly buggy.  A couple months ago the app disappeared from my home screen.  Randomly it reappeared. Last week it disappeared again. I go to the App Store to install and it says it's already installed. I try to open it, and it won't open.   I'm on an iPhone 5s less than a year old.  What's up LinkedIn?",3
2014-10-17 16:36:09,Irritates me,"The app is sleek enough, but it lacks some basic functionality.  The biggest annoyance is that it only works within itself.  If I get an invitation via email, when I click to accept, I only get a Safari page to login, not to the app.  It doesn't even tell me that I have the app installed and give me an option to switch.  So I rarely use it, because I have many other logged in spaces to spend my time.",2
2014-09-07 00:10:18,Lacking everything,"For one of the most popular and business orientated sites, this app sure isn't up to parr. I can not edit my profile from within the app!? I can not see the full profile, exp. certifications!? It's annoying that I am and apple ipad user and have an app that I have to close just to go to the browser version of your site to edit. Obviously I'm going to be doing some editing and revising and not just clicking and viewing(like a Facebook stalker) please fix.",1
2014-09-01 17:36:39,Invites with personal notes don't work,"I love Linkedin and their mobile apps.  There is lots they can do to make these apps more useful.  One value add is the ability to send an invite, from a LinkedIn member's Profile, with a personal note, from within the IPad/IPhone App.  Unfortunately, this new feature does not appear to work right now.  Let's hope it's fixed soon.",3
2014-04-20 01:32:58,Excellent tool for anyone!,"I have been a member for a number of years and have found a number of connections thru here that I would have normally not been able to make.  I think anyone not only job searching, but even  updating current profiles will find this a win / win!",4
2014-06-19 23:44:40,Often Flaky,"Using this on iPad. The icon will show I have new activity, but when you open the app there is nothing to tell you what is new and where to look. As a result you cannot make the notification go away. Extremely annoying. Also, my account on iPad is always out of date with the main online version I access with my PC.",3
2014-05-16 17:11:43,"beware of allowing app to access your ""contacts""","i had to spend over 2 hours on the convoluted process for withdrawing spam-like invites to everyone who has ever taken a breath within a 100-mile radius of me (or some other bizarre connection). i admit to having ""agreed"" to allowing the app to access my contacts, but there is no question that it accessed more than the contacts contained in the email address with which i registered. rather, the app seems to have scanned email traffic via my iphone - including activity related to my work account. 

apparently, this has been a frequent user complaint that the company is not willing to address. i removed the app as soon as i realized what was happening; this truly sets a new standard for abusing privacy!",1
2014-04-09 17:12:31,Very Functional,"I thought that this app did it's job.  I just started using it but, it seems to do everything I would expect out of an app like this I think that it was well done answers it's purpose definitely an app you want to get if you are a link in member and use it from time to time.",4
2013-11-08 17:37:35,Great for Basics on the Go,"I mostly switch between app and website. Don't like the limited capability in the app to update the profile, specifically the bio section. I just want to tweak the wording but looks like I have to rewrite the whole thing.

Otherwise I like the app to browse my groups, people I may know and respond to messages.",4
2014-02-21 16:22:37,Easy way to network,"LinkedIn provides an easy way to network. You are able to job search, keep up with current industry news, and network with others in one place.",5
2013-12-12 01:02:16,Not able to Edit profile,"I was a big fan of this app for ipad for viewing profiles and adding people. However, I am unable to edit my profile or endorse people from this ipad app. I think it's a big deal I can't edit any information on my profile which is why I rated it so low. If your just looking to view profiles and add others, your fine. But sadly you cannot edit your profile content.",2

My opinions os a vehicle of engagement he's been very good and I am glad to have platform agnostic tools to do it on. I say 5 stars so far,5
2013-11-16 17:32:39,Doesn't work as well as computer,"The app is easy to use, but I find that it doesn't relate well to the computer version. Comments and messages don't show up when they are actually posted. It seems to be good for viewing other people's profiles, but it is much more efficient to use the computer to reply to messages and such.",3
2013-09-06 03:30:36,Working great YESTERDAY!,"I wish the email functions were a little more built out but solid app. That you could see sent messages.

But the most frustrating is that yesterday I was able to send messages then with the latest update - no longer. This has happened before. Sigh.",4
2013-10-26 05:45:57,Confusing,I like the Linked In website but the app is awfully confusing. The last app was tricky to navigate but I got used to its quirks This one looks cleaner but has some nasty traits. I accidentally accepted a connection because of the non intuitive way this is set up. Also I have a notification showing on the app icon but no idea what it's for. I'm pretty close to uninstalling this and going back to the website through Safari.,2
2013-08-09 18:15:30,Good for on the go connectivity,"Looking forward to day when functionality on iPhone/iPad is just as robust as it is on the website. Would also like to be able to send connection requests with personalized notes to a non-connect as you can via web. Otherwise, love it.",4
2013-07-05 04:02:54,Works soso,"It is nice to read articles and postings. But when you try to comment the text box keeps scrolling off the screen and you cannot select or paste in the text entry field because it scrolls off. 

I changed my profile online but the app did not show the changes until I killed and restarted the app. 

I've experienced other problems as well and found linked in support to be useless.",2
2012-07-24 01:36:25,Overall it's a thumbs up,"I like the interface. It's easy to navigate through the different features and the text size is just right. Its easy to make new connections. I noticed some unstable buggy behavior when posting to a forum, but that was when the app was new, so it may be fine now.",4
2013-05-23 19:30:07,Needs a lot of work,"Facts: You can not edit your profile from the iPad app, you are not able to follow companies from the iPad app, you are not able to personalize an invitation to connect on iPad app.

You are able to view your own profile and read updates and articles but the app is more of a compilation if posts than something you can use to be effective on the go.

Definitely needs work.",2
2013-04-22 23:05:58,Improved but ...,"The app has improved its design very much and  you can edit your profile easily and some other wonders but it still shows some errors to me saying try again later..Moreover, when I click a LinkedIn link in the gmail or mail app it jumps to the website and when I log in its not the same experience as the app.",3
2013-02-22 05:31:12,What Happened?,The most recent release has crippled the app. I am no longer able to view or edit my own profile let alone view messages from fellow connections. Time to get hot LinkedIn. Test test test before you push your updates. The community uses your service as a tool though when the tool breaks too often do you keep buying the same tool or move to another brand?  Get the point?,2
2012-10-15 23:13:18,They don't get the simple things,"So I get an email from LinkedIn saying someone wants to connect. The email has a hotlink in it which, if you click on it takes you to a web page encouraging you to get the LinkedIn app but I already have the app! I'm at a dead end, have to close out of my web browser and go open my LinkedIn app. It's all backwards, why doesn't it take me directly into the app like other app emails do?",2
2012-09-03 05:07:18,Great app,Makes it easy to stay in touch with professional connections. Updates are easy to put through and messages come through with no problem. It sure beats having to connect on a laptop.,5
2012-08-30 04:28:04,I Wish I Could Give My Clients This Bad Of A Product And They'd Stay With My Firm,"You'd think that a CORPORATE BASED SOCIAL NETWORK would, of all the networks, work! The simple fact is, LinkedIn fails to make products that just work. I wish my firm could retain clients as well as LinkedIn does and provide a half complete product like LinkedIn seems to think is okay. I mean come on, the app practically has a mind of its own and always has. LinkedIn really needs to step up it's game.",2
2011-12-02 02:49:47,Much better!,"I really like the new layout, but am looking forward to an actual iPad app. I think it would be great if you could incorporate a feature that allows connecting with people via Bluetooth or similar to the BUMP app when we are at a networking event. Other than those suggestions I love this version.",4
2012-03-14 01:06:44,Great for on-the-road networking,"This app is a necessity! As an upcoming college graduate, this makes it easy to network and look up new contacts on the go. The user interface is easy with no errors or issues as of yet.",5
2012-01-21 12:27:27,Love it,The app has breathed life into the site in my opinion. I almost never updated or checked on my LinkedIn profile. But since the launch of the new app I have greatly increased my updates and my connections. Great job!,5
2009-01-06 15:34:53,Almost there,"I love LinkedIn.  This app does fairly well at imitation but the ""send note"" is frustrating.  You can't scroll the window so what you can see is all you can type as pretty soon you are typing under the keyboard.  

Still great for a quick lookup or invite.",4
2011-09-08 17:19:39,Old dogs are complaining,This version is actually very nice and progressive. I havent encountered any limitations of functionality since the previous version. Works fine looks good. Old dogs will always complaint when you try something new.,5
2011-08-23 05:34:10,Very impressed,"Not many apps ""really"" allow you access to your network and give you the ability to keep connected from your phone.  This one does.  Very well thought out, easy to use and most of all robust.",5
2011-08-19 04:49:12,"Beautifully designed, easy to use","LOVE this update. The new design is much simpler than the old version, and the design details are awesome. So much attention to detail, and now with groups, yeah! Now I just want the ability to update my profile and I'll be super content",5
2009-06-06 14:51:53,Will there ever be an update?,"This app is good for a product just launched, knowing more improvements to come.  I've had this on my phone 8 months, and is virtually the only app that's never been updated.  See reviews from others re: suggested changes.  The longer we wAit, desktop users will be turned off from using the full online version since they'll think the app is representative of what linkedin is all about.",1
2008-08-21 03:32:27,Works as expected,"A very convenient application, which works exactly like you'd expect. No frills, just a straight forward network manager. I love being able to change my status now, which is something even the webapp never really did well.",4
2017-09-15 22:04:10,Usually an EA/Legal Assistant,This app is great for searching for a new position!  Everyone is so positive and very helpful.  I believe everyone who posts on this app/site truly wants to make a difference in the business world and truly want to help those of us who are seeking full time employment!!!,5
2017-07-01 01:38:37,Everything an app should be,"Neat and well organized, the new app is simple, well designed and easy to use.  I can get to my groups easily, messaging and posting articles works smoothly and it has a clean, uncluttered interface.",5
2017-06-22 11:30:23,Clean and easy to use,"Well integrated functions and stylish interface. My only critique is that visually, I sometimes get it confused with Twitter or Instagram. Maybe it's just me, but all of these social media apps are starting to look the same, kind of blending together.",5
2017-06-20 03:21:16,Good but needs some obvious changes.,"1) There should be a way to know if you've previously sent a person a request to  ""connect"" so that one doesn't send another request(s) if they decline. 

2) There should be a way to hide a person from appearing as a potential network connect permanently. I swiped to hide a person, but they keep showing up.",3
2017-01-11 19:20:46,Almost perfect,Really stepped up messaging and UI. Still some weird disconnects between the desktop and app version and needs better integration in the main app for premium features. Messaging still needs work. Overall soooooo much better than it used to be. Love it. And the feed is great,4
2017-06-08 00:32:45,Great way to stay current,The LinkedIn App has kept my professional interests up to date and I've been more engaged with colleagues. I enjoy the jobs section of the app because I love to forward information to those seeking employment.,5
2017-04-26 23:00:49,Convenient!,"I am enjoying using this app on my phone and iPad.  So easy to check in anytime I have a spare minute. Easy to post from the app as well. I'm glad this is available, otherwise I wouldn't be connected to my colleagues as often.",5
2017-02-01 01:03:10,The most irritating app ever,"Congratulations to LinkedIn for making the most irritating app I own. Like all good spam apps, every time I open it, it asks me to connect my email, with apparently no way to tell it to stop. And why would I open the app at all? Because I get cryptic notifications of non events, like work anniversaries, and once I'm in the app, rather than put all the notifications in a single place, they're sprinkled all over the app so that I'll never find them. Total crap.",1
2017-01-27 03:23:33,Perfect business tool in a user friendly app,"LinkedIn is a perfect business tool that is usable for networking and getting updated with the new business changes.
The new app design makes it pretty easier to work on.
I love this app..",5
2017-01-16 19:42:48,I love this to finally the LinkedIn,"When just like forever news is the information that without you the for as for another people probably the Forbidden are you 
sure to only problem.",5
2016-12-26 05:18:39,LinkedIn review,"I'm really impressed with this app. I have a lot of networking friends who also have joined and it's all business. I've had jobs in my field come via LinkedIn, and made great business acquaintances. It's clean and neat, and helpful. In more aspects than one.",5
2017-01-11 17:16:36,Don't like the update.,"Since the app now mimics the mobile site, I no longer need the app. I want to see how many connections I have, not 500+. That tells me little about my network. Not sure why they changed it but that was the only thing I used the app for. I'll just let my email take me to the mobile app and skip the annoying connect to the internet to be redirected to the app.

Do not like being forced to update to what a lot of people consider a bad design.",1
2016-12-08 19:04:07,Owner,"Love the new LinkedIn. It makes it so easy to connect with previous co-workers, to make new contacts, follow your favorite companies and to keep in touch on a business level. For the most part it is all about networking and less about socializing. Love it!",5
2016-12-07 00:14:01,Love the app!  Can stay in touch when on the move!,"As I travel a lot, if I have a few minutes before a meeting, I reconnect with other professionals or share a relevant article with my connected friends.  It really has helped with my sales!!",5
2016-10-16 16:49:32,Fantastic ! Networking n representation at its best 😃,"I have been part of linked for several years now. Connections , endorsements  n opportunities are great for those looking to network in the professional world. 
Hope to see more great features for the global playing field . ✌🏼️",5
2016-08-19 05:51:28,No complaints,I've used the service for a bit over a year now. Since the app and company have been acquired the job search and streamlining of both the site and application functions has been great. Vital app for any near or recent grads,5
2016-06-11 00:31:23,Broker Associate,LinkedIn is so easy to use and keep up to date with my business contacts and the ability to network with potential new business partners. I like that people keep it very professional on this site.,5
2016-05-03 10:12:15,Love the new look!,"I tried using LinkedIn a few years back but wasn't a huge fan of the interface. I also wasn't quite ready to be in the world of business.
Now that I'm ready to grow my career I'm stoked that this tool is at my disposal.",5
2016-05-01 17:20:10,Well designed,"I love the LinkedIn app - very easy to use, making it easy to stay up to date on current trends that are relevant to my career. Keeping in touch with professional contacts is very simple through LinkedIn as well.",5
2016-04-26 14:28:23,Works at working your work,"I enjoy using the Facebook of work apps. No probs here. The Venn diagram that contains FB friends and LinkedIn connections is almost a complete overlap. This app and the website make it so I don't have to ask ""Hey, how much money do you make?"" Great! We're connected! Now I know!",5
2016-01-22 13:06:31,Easy to navigate,"The app is more enjoyable to use than the website. Switching from the news feed to article content is quicker and smoother, and updates take less time to process.",5
2016-02-03 15:42:41,Why?,"I gave it 1 star and I am being nice here.  
Why did you have to ruin the old app?  Updates or anything else, for that matter, have become cumbersome through the app. 
I still connect through the app, but only when I get a connection request or a comment on my stuff. 
Otherwise, the new app is USELESS. Haven't you guys heard ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it?""  You took something that was doing fine and you broke it. 
Is it too late to go back to the old interface?",1
2016-01-21 15:48:29,Must have app,This is probably the best way you can search for a job. It's not only about finding the exact job you desire but LinkedIn is also about creating a network of people that can help you in your journey to a prosperous career.,5
2015-12-27 18:55:37,LinkedIn is Top of the line,"I love Linked in because of making connections with other professionals and easy to use app. 

The app is a great tool to use to not only connect with professionals but also to find new jobs, services, and other opportunities.",5
2015-11-22 20:32:50,I am a raving fan,"I am a raving fan of LinkedIn.  From the mobile app, I wish there was an easier way to search for 2nd and 3rd level connections within specific geographic regions.  I travel often, and I like to paint my calendar green.  Sometimes, I need to find connections easily in the area to which I am traveling.",4
2015-12-18 11:17:27,Terrible,"Since the most recent update, I get a red notification number 1 on my phone home page. I open the app and it tells me that 1 notification belongs to messages, which I don't and won't use. And I can't clear the notification. I've tried everything. This is deeply disturbing. And I agree with the previous review that points out LinkedIn is lost and wandering, taking the worst aspects of Twitter and fb and appropriating them for itself. Terribly move. Absurd strategy. Utter fail.",1
2015-12-16 04:21:14,LinkedIn is a must have,I love how up to date things are on the site. It helps me stay connected with all the companies I've worked for while still making me feel professionals. A great app and website as a whole.,5
2015-12-08 22:50:37,You finally broke it... Nice,Besides being one of the only apps that can't launch from a LinkedIn generated link in an email the latest update completely fubarred the app.  It won't even load now; it shows the logo in portrait mode then crashes out to the iPad main screen.  Did you push the iPhone version to the pad?  Please fire the group of cheap overseas programmers and put a team of professionals back on developing and deploying your app.   I use this daily and now it's gone.,1
2015-12-08 07:04:28,Nice redesign,"I don't understand the negative reviews here below, it's just the crowed that hate changes, no matter what it is. This redesign seems like a logical step forward for LinkedIn and I think it was nicely done. The app functions pretty much exactly the way it did before.",5
2015-12-06 22:01:27,Nearly the worst update ever,"This app was never the best but generally worked albeit with some frustration. The UI is now nicer but that's about all I can say that is positive.
I can go into all the technical mess ups they have done but what bugs me the most is that even landscape mode doesn't work....that's right you can't even use it landscape which is ridiculous since many people use their IPads landscape with or without keyboard.
LinkedIn need a new product manager for their apps.",1
2015-11-24 03:52:32,Nice app and nice service,Helps using the tool on a smart phone. Fast and had not crashed on me like other apps that are SaaS and their app is not up to par. Not here! If you use LinkedIn on the web you will want to download this app for access from your phone.,5
2014-11-01 00:27:59,Use it most every day.,"Is it perfect? no Is it great? Yes. Trying to keep track of all the people I've known in my career is impossible without a tool like LinkedIn. It works for me. The endorsement element gets a little over done because it's very subjective and most often not based on true first hand experience. Otherwise,👍👍",4
2015-04-10 22:07:11,Networking at its best!,"I love LinkedIn. A friend introduced this to me some years ago and it has helped me in many ways. From connection inc with other professionals in my field, recruiting and a wealth of shared resources that I have found immensely helpful. It's a must have tool for any professional.",5
2015-02-21 20:32:09,Great social app!,"Great way to show your professional profile, contact business people, get noticed by recruiters, show off your resume and be noticed and recommended by people you have work/worked with.
I use it daily!",5
2015-01-27 02:16:57,Has room for improvement,"I'm a huge fan of LinkedIn as a professional social networking platform, but I'm not impressed with the app. For me, it does not flow well and is not intuitive.  I also find that Messages and Notifications are not always up to date. I just think there is room for some UX improvement on the mobile side of the platform.",3
2015-01-06 19:46:36,Poor,"I am just starting to use LinkedIn as it is becoming a popular way to professionally connect with people. It is unbelievably hard to operate on a mobile device (iPhone, iPad) and it is incredibly cluttered and the fact that the layout has not been updated for the newer iPhone sizes makes it even harder to understand the items on the screen. Hoping for an improvement as soon as possible, otherwise... I will stick to handshakes for connecting!",1
2014-09-21 17:33:01,Great Networking Platform,"I use LinkedIn for a couple years now. I love it. However, the sent email feature in the app is still missing and requires login on the full website. Hopefully this can be addressed in one of the new releases. Other than that I have everything I need on my smart phone.",4
2014-08-16 06:42:41,Best Professional Social Media App,I won't date myself by saying how long I've been on LinkedIn but this App is by far the best one for professional networking and communications. This would be five stars if I could easily endorse the skills I identify for the people I choose (rather than a random list of people in my network).,4
2014-08-06 01:54:05,Very good app.!,"This is a very good app. and I like the recent changes to it, but why on an iPhone can't I change my profile picture?? I click on the box with the camera and it doesn't allow me to take a photo or select a photo to put on there. This is very frustrating...please fix soon! :-)",4
2014-06-14 18:02:00,Not bad still some glitches,The Mobile Web app doesn't keep the iOS app launcher banner up so it's annoying that you'll have to login through the mobile browser.  This happens when I click on a link within any of my linkedin email notifications.,4
2014-07-29 07:01:59,Responsive to Feedback,"I had suggested just a week ago that they expand the information on the profile that's displayed, and here we are with this new update that shows it all. I don't know if it was in the works, but thanks LinkedIn!!!",5
2014-03-06 21:43:44,Update to App,"Love the path to network from friends networks.  I have experience & education other than my work HX suggests that I would like to find a career in. It appears that options for group networking were limited to only my work experience...
Improvements on your app is always good...keep up the good work!",4
2014-03-28 10:21:33,Terrible app,"I love LinkedIn but the support on the Apple products is just plain terrible. The app doesn't flow like the website, it's a copy of Flipboard but a bad copy and you can't copy and paste from another app into the LinkedIn App as the keyboard and the screen keep jumping up. On top of it all the web page in Safari you can't like anything and I accidentally open profiles or send invites to people I don't know all the time because the website isn't responsive at all. Get it together!",1
2014-03-13 23:27:22,A must-have app for any professional,The LinkedIn App keeps me updated of any new events and questions/concerns from all people/groups in my network. The apps bring the level of interaction to a higher level. Thanks for the awesome work LinkedIn team!,5
2013-05-26 14:38:54,Better than previous version!!,"👍👍👍 The UI is really nice for iPhone.. The only issue I have is.. I cannot search for companies.. At all I can only view suggested ones.. When searching for people I cannot specify the city 

But it's way better than old version!! I use it more than the actual site!!",4
2014-02-18 12:34:30,Garbage,"I tried to sign in multiple times, every time it asked me if I had forgotten my password. After numerous failed attempts I followed the instructions and changed my password and the app continued to ask me if I had forgotten my password and won't let me sign in. I just created my account so I know exactly what my password is. This does not happen to me on the desktop version, only on this mobile app. I deleted this app quickly as I had next to no luck with it.",1
2014-01-30 16:27:02,Not bad but could have more features,Nice overview of posted info. Nice to be able to invite connections. Would be even better if u could accept invitations and have the ability to edit profile. I was not able to find my groups either. Still with the download. But more could be added to make this more functional.,3
2013-09-05 18:31:28,LinkedIn,"Great app ! It is an excellent way to find people in your industry and clientele to improve your sales and get your name on the market . All in all LinkedIn is an excellent app for businesses small to large , and a great way to meet people in your field and clients looking for your services.",5
2013-08-04 19:28:35,Limited functionality,"With limited functionality and quite a few issues, this app is virtually useless. You cannot manage your account as you should. Links in your Linkedin emails will not open the app but go to your web browser. It does not indicate you have a message. Not a substitute for the web access. Just a toy.",3
2013-07-01 23:39:53,Not happy with a few things,"Please fix the app so you don't have to enter in the email of the person or company of whom you want to connect with. If they have a LinkedIn profile they should automatically be sent a notification of request (Like Facebook). I enjoy the app but another problem I have is with the emails of endorsements to ""confirm"" yet nothing appears for me to confirm when I log into my profile? Good luck!",2
2013-06-11 05:57:52,Useless.,"Just saw a posting from a ""director"" promoting a piece on spanking women in Israel for something...didn't even read it all because the picture was so offensive.  Come on LinkedIn...the content has become hard to access, and is becoming irrelevant.  I mean really...a picture of 4 women with their arses hanging out is approved content?????  Not the kind of business I wish to engage in.  Just the next facebook.  That's all.  Delete the app and pick up the phone...have a conversation.  You might enjoy it.",1
2013-05-28 15:36:21,Doesn't work,"Why is it that I get email in my email acct but the app never shows that there are pending requests. Fed up trying to make this work. The requests NEVER open the app and my requests NEVER show up on email or messages in the app. The fix is garbage & I am deleting this crap app ASAP. Don't fix something that isn't broken. Linked in and Bing totally lost me. Deleted both after last ""improvements"" SUCKED. Bye bye linked ""out"". I had to give it 1 star to post review.... But there was no minus 5 stars.",1
2013-04-24 21:05:30,Love the interface but functionality needs work,Very easy to use and great design/interface but hard to update personal information and progress. Also search options need work. Need to fix issue with updating connections and requests more accurately,4
2012-09-07 19:15:55,Update,"It's unfortunate that everyone immediately goes to a one star rating when undesirable results occur during an update. The app does everything you can ask for except having the ability to add a custom message to connection invites. With that featured added, I would make this a five star app.",4
2013-03-06 01:29:52,Still Useless,"I just updated and none of the problems have been fixed.

This app essentially does not function. You can't load company profiles, invites to connect don't send, and you're unable to successfully accept when someone else requests to connect with you. All it's good for is letting me know I have such requests, so I know to log in from my laptop and accept them.

How does the mobile version of LinkedIn work correctly, but they can't get the app right?",1
2012-09-18 18:11:48,Good on the go,"Though it does not support the full functionality of the website, it does provide provide useful features which are pretty handy on the go! Probably they could include the inmail option and job search option which would then enable us to access the most part of the website features.",3
2012-09-08 23:46:38,LinkedIn is not functional on mobile.,"App is non-descriptive, poorly organized, and runs slowly. No ability to add personal messages to invitations to connect, which I hate. Should do away with the triple-icon home page altogether. 

Furthermore, when I try to visit LinkedIn on my iPad Google Chrome browser, it breaks almost every time. Cannot zoom in (which is necessary due to text/link size), and cannot type fast enough before the site stops responding.

Please improve!",1
2012-03-29 13:19:18,Need to personalize connect request,I like the new and improved version both in look and feel. I would really like the opportunity to write a short personal message in the connection request email that LinkedIn sends from the app.,4
2011-12-19 20:06:05,Review,"So far I liked it. So far after trying the 
Facebook app this app operates faster.
Have not tried , to add any pictures yet.
 I have not done any traveling yet. Due to the notification feature would that be a problem, if not used, to receive data ?",4
2011-12-02 19:13:20,Contact sync bug fixed!,Finally.....you guys fixed the bug that didn't allow you to save your linkedin contacts directly to your iPhone. Good job! Keep up the good work. Now if only you'd allow me to edit my profile from within this app. Like make modifications and add changes etc...,4
2011-11-24 15:37:20,Simple & Beautiful Annimations,"The LinkedIn app has evolved a lot over the past 1-2 years.  The incessant drive to continually reinvent the app into the most relevant and usable form of LinkedIn means there is always change, but this is one of the higher grade applications in the AppStore.  Its a real pleasure to use this app, thanks guys!",5
2011-08-18 18:21:27,Great mobile app,"Great rewrite of the mobile app; all the most commonly used features are here. 

No, you can't edit your profile from your phone, but do you really want autocorrect to change words on your profile? Some thing are best done at home.",5
2017-09-01 23:11:47,Love it!,"Love that the iPad version has finally been fixed to show a users uploaded photos & videos in their profile. For the longest time, you could only see this information on a desktop or laptop.",5
2009-08-28 05:27:00,JrFlip,Good way to stay on top of your LinkedIn account. But hard to type a message to a connection when your message goes beyond the window view. Doesn't follow you when you keep typing and you end up guessing what your typing since you can't see it.....ending your message abruptly. PLEASE FIX!!! so we can send messages.,3

2017-04-30 16:52:30,Terrible UI Affects Usability,I downloaded their app after being prompted by an email link. It took me tries to actually load the proper page in the app (each time I was bombarded by a new user modal instead) and when I finally entered the chat/inbox screen the iOS keyboard was forced open with no way to hit any of the buttons :/ I had a better experience on their mobile site but it was still pretty jank.,2
2017-02-02 19:32:57,Getting better and better,LinkedIn is becoming increasingly critical to use as a business person and the app is finally looking the part. Stale design and glitchyness are giving way to an app you actually want to use.,5
2017-01-05 17:21:08,Push notifications,"LinkedIn is a handy app to have, but PLEASE fix the push notification system. I selected the notifications I want to receive in app, but then get hit with a ton that I don't care about. It was annoying enough that I disabled notifications from the app in general. Push notifications are pretty basic for an app, I'm surprised this is an issue for a company with the resources that LinkedIn has.",2
2017-01-03 05:53:13,Terrible defaults and senseless notifications,"No one needs to be notified via a little red number in the upper right corner of the app that someone has a work anniversary, but the default is to share your work anniversary. There's not an intuitive way to stop this because LinkedIn knows that they aren't driving users to the app enough with their content and user engagement. My solution is to delete the app until LinkedIn provides an incentive for me actually use the app.",1
2016-12-24 22:40:52,So buggy!,"This app is so buggy! When I click on my photo icon on the top left to go to my profile, half of the time it doesn't work! Once you're finally there and you click the ""view full profile"" button, it does nothing. Moreover, your messages aren't updated in real time. I was on LinkedIn on my desktop and saw that I had 2 new messages yesterday and the app still hasn't reflected that (1 day later). 
I expected better from LinkedIn.",1

2016-08-18 04:27:22,Amazing results,"I was skeptical about using LinkedIn and the benefits thereof.
The benefits have been endless, using LinkedIn guided me to create and cultivate professional environment that has enriched my career and helped me identify and focus on my objectives. 
Ive had a career beyond my wildest dreams, thank you for the incredible support!",5
2016-05-05 02:28:37,Great way to network!,"My only complaint is that when I add my previous work history the only job recommendations the app shows are for my previous employment (which, in my case, is completely different) and not my present employment.  Thus I do not have my previous employment on my LinkedIn.",4
2016-05-17 05:28:32,Keep Up With the Apps Would You?!,I hate that you don't see who you just connected with. You get a notification but the new contact gets dumped in your contacts list alphabetically & you have to use the desktop version to see who you just connected with. And profile updating is too limited with the mobile app.,3
2016-04-30 16:28:57,Good App but needs to improve,"Great app for professional growth and connecting with coworkers and friends. Bad idea for just one app for messaging, commenting or getting timely notifications on anniversary's. I also think that the app should have the option to be in Apple Watch. But otherwise I give you a 4 star rating.",4
2016-04-05 01:02:44,Getting better all the time!,This app is finally starting to show some real potential and promise! Just a few more tweaks to ease business networking and indexing business cards by way of the camera with automatic invites to connect and it'll start to be close to a five star review. For now it's a solid 3+/4-.,4
2016-04-26 10:22:28,Great app!,Every time I've used this app--which I do often--it has always done what it's supposed to do. I can get to my account and see all that I would see and do on my laptop. Easy to navigate. Works for the simple and not so tech savvy user like me.,5
2016-03-17 18:46:05,For those who use this app less often,"The app is direct and to the point. You can search, send  messages, and even prospect for new business.  I'm not running into the problems other share. But that may be because I don't spend a great amount of time on the app daily.",4
2016-04-04 17:28:24,A must have for all professionals,"The LinkedIn app is a must have. I found my last job through it and maintain my professional network with it. I also blog to help build and maintain my personal brand. 

I now use the app daily. You should too.",5
2016-01-14 16:22:53,"Good overall, web links don't open well","Overall great app, only complaint is that when I open a web link that somebody shared or posted on my iPhone 6s, I can't zoom out to see the whole page. So if I want to read the article I have to slide the screen back and forth.",4
2015-12-18 18:33:45,Resume replacement?,"If you want this to replicate or replace a resume, you need to make sure the different jobs and activities listed are listed in reverse chronological order or are easily manipulated by the user. I have somethings listed 3rd in my activities list that is important and most current and I am unable to move it up or down the list",3
2015-02-07 13:43:55,Great App for Professional Networking!,"If you're into social networks, and want an app to keep up with your professional contacts and colleagues, look no further than Linked In! You not only be able to do that, but, if configured correctly, get relevant news and updates on your area or specialty.",4
2015-12-09 22:51:39,Very disappointing version,"I use my iPad everywhere and everytime, at work and at home. Linkedin was an app I was using every day, several times a day.
This version has made it difficult to use on a tablet. I will probably stop using the app until, hopefully, a new version makes it easier to use on tablets and reinstate functions that were key. 
Being in the IT business, maybe I can help with ""usability"" aspect ? Looks like there might be a need there.",1
2015-12-06 00:12:36,iPad orientation is stuck in portrait mode,"The new update for iPad doesn't allow the app to change from portrait to landscape view, it's locked in portrait. Hopefully this will be fixed with the next update. But for now it's rather irritating. 

I haven't played with enough to check out the new features and UI but I do like the messaging feature.",3
2015-12-03 23:13:55,"Sadly, a step back","I agree with a number is the most recent reviews the past 24 hours or so that this update is a step backwards. Though the app before had its issues, by and large it was a decent replication of the Web experience.

This new update is akin to Facebook in terms of UI UX (not a good thing), constrains me to profile mode only (unless I'm missing something), and attempts to a newsfeed with minimalist design.

Note to self: Use mobile browser to access LI from now on.",1
2015-12-03 15:59:25,what were they thinking - don't update if you value landscape orientation,"The ipad has a rotation feature for a reason. People like to use the unit in various orientations especially business apps by business users. 

Why linkedin felt it was a disposable feature to eliminate rotation support in their new app is beyond me. As I use my iPad in the clam case with the keyboard out during the day, they pretty much just made it so I will NEVER use the linkedin app while at work. I am not folding the keyboard back and switching to another mode just so I can use the app in a forced portrait orientation.

Ruined a great app with this design choice. I don't care if it is related to your view framework; that is a deficiency of the framework if it is a limitation.

Don't update if you like landscape orientation.",1
2015-08-11 09:37:28,Frozen messages,"I'm not able to access messages and have a call with a contact tomorrow. Need to see what time so it's kind of urgent. The messaging tool at a top tech company should not be completely down. Going forward, I'll probably just switch to email asap since this makes me feel the messaging function is unreliable.",3
2015-06-01 15:38:49,Must have app for everyone,Incredibly helpful for creating business and personal connections as well as tracking all of the people you meet over time.  I've relied on it at more than one party for reminding me people's names that I've forgotten.,5
2015-03-10 18:17:52,Clean and Simple,"Does what you need, and easy to use. What more can you ask for? (Maybe the ability to edit parts your profile from App, instead of having to go to the full site...but still ;) )",5
2015-03-02 19:53:46,Good but can be better,"Message sent cannot be seen at the app, which is important function on the web version. Also, message function not stable for both app and computer version.",5
2014-01-15 17:16:03,Good tool,"The tool itself is pretty good. Provides good access to the linked in data.  If you value linked in, the tool should price valuable too you.  Frequently updated, so it stays relevant. Only bad thing is the interface changes too much. You have to learn navigation every time you open.",4
2014-10-15 13:25:10,Much improved,"Mobile linkedin has improved considerably over previous releases.  I can now do most of the linkedin functionality on my iphone, where before I would only use my computer.",5
2014-09-30 02:52:01,Edit features coming?,"If all you want to do is read/check your profile, the mobile app is great. However, if you find a typo or want to edit your profile for any other reason, I have yet to find a way to do so using the mobile version. I'm forced to log in using Safari on my iPad.

If a mobile app is meant to replace its web counterpart, such basic functionality should be included.",2
2014-08-13 13:33:47,There are better contact lists,I signed up for linked in so that I could have a contact list that I did not have to keep up on my own. It has put much more emphasis on other features. It is more than I wanted and less than I need but still the thing in use for keeping track of those I have met and worked with in my career.,3
2014-02-28 16:52:07,An app that's still not optimized for mobile use,"Still doesn't integrate app from email notifications, forcing user to login in on mobile site. Should say, ""Open App?"" Searching for new contacts without a complete name is not easy. Should have capabilities similar to desktop version - how much research is done on smartphones on-the-go? 80% of time on mobile is spent in apps - so why is LinkedIn still not optimized???",2
2014-02-04 00:28:43,Great mobile version of the website,"Not all social networking sites translate well to the mobile device, but LinkedIn has done a great job with their app.  So intuitive and easy to use I am using the website less and less",5

2013-07-12 02:07:52,LinkedIn will change your career and life,"This is not merely an app. It is the best career move you can make. Use it. I use it daily. I'm a CEO, and use Linkedin for many purposes. It's especially powerful for reaching new opportunities through the largest professional network in the world.",5
2013-09-11 02:28:39,Very Mediocre,"I am still stupefied that LinkedIn bothered to release what is basically a profiles viewer of LI members, with tons of commercials and ads you can scroll through.  You can't DO any LI operations with this app.  Searches have no filters, you can't update your profile, just post ""updates"", etc.

So if I have to go to the browser version to do most if the things I use LI for, why bother with the do-nothing app version?",2
2013-04-20 13:47:51,Bottom line the reason for its success,"Enables people to interact in a socially/professional environment so they are able to show off their professional background, designations, MBA's etc and get recognition, one of the most awesome feelings a person can feel. It all revolves on that.",5
2013-05-15 13:49:17,What a Hack!,"I thought LinkedIn is a serious professional group social media that could be trusted and that your info is secured, but not this time. I'm gubbsmacked when I received a user support email from LinkedIn that linked me to a Toronto drug web page advertising Viagra and similar products. What a shame and a sham! I could not even email LinkedIn user support team to alert them about this, hence this open approach. 
'Thank you' LinkedIn for making my personal info known to Toronto (Viagra) company. What a disgrace.",1
2013-03-18 05:02:02,Nifty,"I do not know what anyone is saying, so I can not attest to their poor ratings. Have had the app for 10+ hours, running fairly continuously. It works fine! I did not give it 5 stars because I feel the interface can have more & the layout is just ""okay"", other than that I love this app!",4
2012-04-30 11:43:37,Love the new layout,Love the new layout and functionality of the latest version. The addition of the calendar view makes we want to open LinkedIn first thing in the morning to see what's on tap for the day. Great job on the enhancements!,5
2013-03-08 05:42:13,Pretty but Useless,"The app is attractive but it is not functional. The iPad app only gives highlights but not details. For example, the update page may say ""Five people have viewed your profile"" and you can see pictures of the first three but not the last two. If you click on the headline it takes you to one of the profiles but never to the list. The same is true for profile updates. It's frustrating. The iPhone app is better.",1
2013-01-11 09:26:02,What a steaming pile…,"Ok first, never, EVER lock people out of the full website experience. No matter what I try--even editing the URL directly--I get shoved right back to their mobile site... that doesn't work; I can't log in (yes, l/p is correct).

Maybe that's their way of forcing people to download the full app, but what do I get after downloading? The app crashes straightaway on iPhone 5 and latest iOS…so I can't use this either.

Thanks, LinkedIn. I knew there was a reason I don't use this network much.",1
2012-12-16 16:12:52,Good but not great,"Great interface with all the essentials to view your profile and others, read/post messages and articles but where are jobs? I have a premium LinkedIn account from which I do all of the above in addition to looking for jobs, saving jobs, and applying to jobs. I'd love to be able to at least view and save jobs from my iPad.",3
2012-09-06 16:17:21,Don't install!,"I get the same error everyone else is mentioning.
Also, as a side note applicable to all versions, anytime I try to visit a LinkedIn profile from web browser, I get a redirect page that asks if I would like to ""Get the App"" or ""No Thanks"". I have the app installed, so I choose ""No Thanks"" and the page hangs indefinitely. Please make it so it checks to see if I have the app installed before showing this page! Major flaw for people scanning QR codes and surfing with a web browser!",1
2012-08-08 01:56:11,Not ideal,"The website is great! But the app has very limited capability. Even when I want to load the full site and go to ""jobs"" tab, it goes back to the mobile version which does not include search criteria to search for jobs on the go. You cannot write a recommendation nor can you review your sent inbox. I don't know. It could have been better",3
2012-06-28 15:44:49,"Hmmm, you spy on us? Is that why it crashes so much?","I just downloaded the app and am now reading all the other reviews.  If any of those folks knew what Google was doing they wouldn't mind a little spying from LinkedIn... 
My issue is that I just downloaded the app and it has crashed 4 times in the last 5 minutes? I already don't use the iPhone app because it crashes continuously.  How about instead of ""looking in on our info to help us"" you make it so that it works!
Thanks
CoryT",1
2012-06-26 22:45:39,Buggy as all get-out,"I used to love the LinkedIn app, but somewhere down the line they broke something. I cannot accept invites or reply to messages without the ""something went wrong... We have no idea WHAT went wrong, but rest assured SOMETHING did"" error. So, hooray- I can see updates but that's about it. I know it's free, but you're data mining the ever loving crap out of our info, so seems fair to ask you to fix it if you get a sec... Thanks!",2
2012-05-07 02:25:11,Decent Start,"This is where I would have expected LinkedIn to start from.  It needs a lot of work, especially the ability to work more with your profile.  Interface needs a lot of clean-up and more logical/cohesive organization.  But it is a good ""Version 1""-style. 

The news reader is terrible.  The app does not support in-LinkedIn things (ie, voting in polls).  The bar at the top takes up too much real-estate on the phone. They tried very hard to impress but clearly bit off more than they could chew at once. 

The next update will likely fix all the crashes, but I doubt it will improve the interface much. 

Ending on a positive note:
The general summaries page for your connections is very, very good.",2
2012-05-01 01:18:35,Major areas missing!,"I miss not having people and companies you may know, not on hand,p. I miss not being able to delete a person. I miss not having any editing features! All of this was on the prior app! If these facets

2012-04-27 15:20:40,"Huge, I repeat: Huge Improvement","Huge improvement!  Better organized, faster, and what apps should be.  Other companies should take note of this and quit sending out websites  apps and create apps designed for smart phones and tablets.   
Great job!!!",5

2017-09-07 12:47:40,Useful,"This is the most useful social account app anyone could have. Find jobs, learn essential news, current events, follow your favorite businesses, connect with friends in a professional manner... I just love it for actually serving me as a social site.",5
2012-01-16 13:54:33,"Ok, but lacking...","The ability to customize invitations to connect with a personal message is very frustrating. It flies in the face of LinkedIn Best Practices, having the ability to tell someone why it would be beneficial to connect. Also would like the ability to better track my group discussions with this app.",3
2011-08-17 02:12:09,Need an iPad App ASAP!,"What is taking LinkedIn so long to release an app optimized for the iPad?  Can't be the money, after all they made on the recent IPO!  Perhaps they don't care?  Using the iPhone app on the iPad is VERY LAME!

I have updated my rating a bit becasue I like the new version of LinkedIn mobile released today.  However, still no version for iPad.  When they release for iPad I will give it 5 stars.",3
2010-06-09 10:00:58,"Won't update, won't show pending stuff","Besides the crashes, when I look at my inbox, it only shows me 4 items. When I click the link to get more, nothing happens. When I've seen and archived all 4, nothing else shows up. I tried clicking the circular arrow, but nothing happened. Also, there's no way to review pending things (like recommendations waiting for you to accept them). Looks decent, but basically worthless.",1
2017-08-26 17:43:49,More fun than Facebook or google plus,I enjoy being able to create videos. Watch out vloggers. I love this app! Just created my first video and uploading it now. I love the project moving forward encouraging people. My fan base. My support. Growing and showing. Thanks!,5
2017-06-30 11:56:17,Great functionality,Are use LinkedIn for many years and I've use the app since it first came out! It is well organized and easy to use. I enjoy the functionality and ease of access. Great app and very user-friendly!,5
2017-06-09 15:08:34,Great App to keep connected with the world,I have just recently started to us the app more than ever before. I have not experienced any crash or issues with this app. This is a great tool to keep connected and updated all the time. Thanks 😊,5
2016-05-04 00:22:41,Best engaging app!,LinkedIn App has been so much better since the last updates. I like how it keeps us informed of new statuses of those we follow so we can congratulate them and give recognitions in a timely manner. This is the most purposeful social network and the app makes it even easier to navigate.,4

2017-02-11 14:21:37,Gets the job done,"Pseudo intuitive app for a dubiously worthwhile social network.

Enough has been said about the annoying UI, so I won't repeat that - it's confusing. The biggest thing I miss is the insights about my profile views, specifically how I rank. PLEASE bring that back as you make the other fixes!",1
2016-09-18 21:09:42,"Good app, but has one annoying issue","It doesn't let you paste the password field. Apps need to be friendly with password managers like 1Password, etc.

Get with the times LinkedIn!!",3
2016-06-13 11:28:26,UI is annoying,"Every time I open the app it shows me the same modal to connect to the same people. Guess what LinkedIn, I didn't want to connect with them then and I don't want to now. I hit skip every time and it keeps showing them to me. Button placement on that modal is frustrating too, the skip button is way too close to the ""connect"" button, and it's touch radius is really small.",2

2016-02-12 00:32:31,Absolute Rubbish Interface,"Used to love this app and was a premium member, but cancelled my monthly spend for the following reasons. No wonder their stock has tanked. 

1. Aesthetics: My 3 year old could not have designed a more child like interface. The old app had a professional look and feel, this new thing looks like a kids toy. 

2. Confusing: When the old app notified you had a new contact, or people had been viewing your page, or contacts had posted, you knew. It was clear. With the new app, a user has no idea at all. It looks like you might have a new contact, but in actual fact, it's probably a notice on someone's blog. Just a waste of time. 

Bottom line, it looks, feels and operates like a kids toy, not a professionals network tool.",1
2015-12-18 07:27:38,Got massive problems,"Where is the list of my contacts? OK, I found it after a LONG search in the least obvious place. You don't think it's a useful enough view?
How to use iPad version in landscape? It's very uncomfortable to use it in portrait with a physical keyboard. Update: suddenly it started working after a second launch.
And why change something that works to something that, well, mostly doesn't?
Last but not least: how is it an update?",1
2015-12-16 22:56:54,Main necessities are not working,The redesign looks Betty nice and clean. Plus it goes across all platforms. That's very much appreciated. When I get new connections I'm never notified anymore. Also the messaging feature behaves awkward. Only messages started in the app are feud in the app. That makes communicating with new connections very difficult. Please fix these issues.,3
2015-12-11 06:23:44,WTH happened...This is TOTAL CRAP,"I'm at a lost for words, what is up with this update, and complete garbage app.  Where do I start.  First it is NOT user friendly, it doesn't rotate with the Ipad, everything is missing, and it completely make it so simple that you cannot use it anymore.  I lived on LinkedIn, paid for it, and now i'm stuck using the browser version...if you can DO NOT UPDATE...DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT....***contacted support***You cannot Roll Back...its like using crack one time and your screwed for life***DON""T DOWNLOAD IT",1
2015-12-08 15:36:14,Update ruined App,"Can't find anywhere to see notifications. Like when someone new has accepted my request.

2015-12-08 02:50:12,Not a fan of the redesign,"I know it's probably a big effort on your part, and to be fair the app does ""look"" good. But it is not as useful as it used to be (that's being fair, not harsh)

There's a reason apps are supposed to be similar to a website. I don't have the time to spend, or any inclination towards, learning your new app design. Very active user in the past, this is pointless.",3
2015-12-02 23:51:17,Love the refresh!,Huge improvement to previous versions. Looks like the old Connected app features are living in the My Network tab. So much easier to maintain my network now with the new messaging capabilities!,5

It will still not let me login even with the correct email and password that o used to login on my computer.",1
2015-09-29 03:17:18,Awful on iPhone & iPad,"It blows my mind that this app is this poor for a global company who owns the market.  To think that Facebook was so hated years ago because they had a weak mobile connection, but that same sentiment doesn't seem to be with LinkedIn. 

Pages routinely fail to load. Slow, so much so I dread clicking on the icon knowing it probably won't work. 

LinkedIn will be in serious trouble if anyone decides to develop a job networking database with a strong mobile ability.",1
2015-08-25 14:20:43,Terrible and the only choice,"LinkedIn mines your email and contacts and will independently send everyone you know anyone you've emailed an invitation numerous times. They've been sued in a class-action suit for this and of been found guilty. As soon as there's another choice I'll use it. Or use LinkedIn reluctantly because there's no other choice. User beware
This is the ninth one star review I've tried to submit. They found a way to keep all one star reviews off. Again user beware.",1
2015-06-24 21:08:45,"So, so, SO bad!","This app is extremely frustrating to use with the iPad. First, when you get an email notification from LinkedIn and try to click on it on your iPad the link doesn't take you to the linkedin app, but to a webpage suggesting you download the app. Second, if I do try to open the app correctly, it doesn't show messages that will appear if I open my linked in account on the computer browser. This app is really more trouble than it's worth.",1
2015-06-04 20:19:49,Impressive,"I love the app but I really wish it would showcase the background on people's profile pages on this mobile version of the desktop site. Also, I would like it to include more of the media available on the desktop site on this mobile version.",4
2015-05-30 14:16:42,Marissa in Michigan,Can you please syncs contacts from Facebook?  It would be so much easier to find the people that I know. I don't have most contacts in my outlook contacts.  I think that this move would be very beneficial for you guys.  Thanks!!,5
2015-04-15 21:27:18,Networking tool,"I love the app. I graduated from college and was having a hard time finding a job so I created a LinkedIn and found my current position on there. In my line of work, networking and connections are important so this is app is very valuable to me!",5
2015-05-21 13:24:15,Suggestion:,"Overall, I like the app. It does what it needs to do albeit a bit slow. 

I have a tiny UI suggestion: when users comment on posts, the color and fonts of their name and message are exactly the same. This makes it sometimes unclear where the name ends and where the comment begins. A darker name font color would really clear things up!",3
2015-01-25 02:13:33,Pretty Good,"The app makes job-hunting on the sly a lot easier, and the push notifications are helpful. The job search function on the mobile app needs to be tweaked so that one can search under specific keywords, ZIP codes, etc. Also, some recruiters don't receive my job information properly when I apply for a position via the app.",3
2015-02-24 17:40:39,Needs improvement,"This app leaves a lot to be desired. Navigation is poor and frustrating. I should not have to tap two or three different places to find my messages.

Also, trying to find the buried sign out tab is a real pain. I use this only when I have to to keep in touch. Really needs a redesign with ease of use -- not forced LinkedIn promos like ""see who else you may know"" to wade through.",2
2015-01-19 00:28:36,It's just ok,LinkedIn is way too serious. They will cut you off if one to two people say they don't know you. I've got an apologies for them clicking know by accident and then becoming a connection. There's got to be another way LinkedIn you should not be cutting people off because someone says they do not know them. And then you want us to pay $60 a month cut it out please!!! I am not really happy with LinkedIn at all!!!!,2
2013-09-16 21:31:00,Good app,I like this app except for one glaring problem. Why can't we have landscape view on our phones? This would make articles so much easier to read. The screen can be zoomed in portrait mode but that requires a lot of swiping back-and-forth to read anything. Please fix this.,4
2014-11-20 17:02:28,Love LinkedIn,Great app that makes it so easy to keep up with what's going on with my colleagues and the companies I'm interested in. Also got my great new job after seeing the posting promptly after it was listed on the newsfeed. Highly recommended!,5
2014-09-06 02:06:54,User,"The app has improved and I like the new interface. The only criticism I have is that u cannot access or change the settings in their entirety. You can only view the basics like changing your photo. But when it comes to privacy, I want to be able to update my settings from all my devises, as I feel that should be a top priority.",3
2014-08-06 12:55:26,Missing Profile Information,"I noticed that connection profile information is missing from the app. Connections profile will load with a blank page with only the name and connection button. However, the iPhone version of the app seems to be unaffected. Overall, the iPad app seems less and less effective as time passes and is in desperate need of an update.",2
2014-07-12 19:29:23,Useless app don't waste your time.,"This is a completely useless app. You cannot make changes to you profile though this app. All you can do is view profiles and read articles that are meaningless to anyone except the article author. 

If you want to update your profile or do any serious LinkedIn thing you have to log into the website from your computers browser. 

Hopefully someday LinedIn will join the 21st century and learn how people use mobile devices.",1
2014-06-05 19:31:55,Useless if you have to use a computer for some functionality,"I rarely write reviews, but I am so tired of apps that limit functionality and force me to use a computer, it essentially defeats the purpose of a mobile app.
If I can add connections on the go, I should also be able to remove connections on the go.  The fact that I now have to go and grab my computer is just unacceptable.  Do better.",2
2014-02-13 12:51:24,Great professional network,"This is a great way to make professional  connections.  I have had some issues with the push notifications that are sent to my email.  I'll click on the link in the mail and it asks me to sign in, but then it just takes me to my homepage instead of the article or blog I was trying to read.",3
2014-01-08 13:40:27,"Works fine, it's linkedin.. Don't know why I have to rate every app I download though.","I've noticed lately in iOS every app I download asks me to rate it.. I ignore it but when I get asked almost daily to rate it.. That goes into a rating. Why do I have to comment on everything I use? Zzzz... I mean today's society with companies trying to use social media to advertise.. It's changed from buy this buy this, to buy this, and tell your friends on Facebook you bought it!.. For real? Lol.. that is all.",1
2013-10-22 11:27:28,Great source to grow your network.,"LinkedIn is for me, one of the best ideas ever!, this help me to keep in touch with customers and also to offer new products and services from my company, just a fantastic and professional web site.",5
2013-10-07 21:38:24,Meeting people for B2B Business,"Excellent way in staying in touch with other people I meet. I love knowing how  I can support my friends in business and letting them know how I they can support my business. Business to business referral are important, as much as integrity.",5
2013-04-14 07:27:36,Great....but...,"I need a way to edit my profile on my iPad and iPhone. If that's already possible, then it needs to be clearer. Because I have scoured every corner of the app. Other than that, great! Give me that ability and it'll be a 5 star app. Maybe implement that side bar thing that Facebook and google+ seem to be fond of...",4
2013-09-09 15:45:17,Disappointing and useless,"This app continues to baffle me. I see no real use to the app and continue to try to manage my profile on the to by trying to use the desktop website from my mobile device.

Editing of ones profile in the app is not able, so therefor, you must login using safari/chrome/etc. Disappointing!

The ability to search contacts is also difficult. Even though I can find connections by going to my profile, this can be difficult.

The messages area of the app is pointless. I cannot figure it out in the end!

This app is extremely disappointing and useless as it stands currently. I really hope, for your sake LinkedIn, that these issues get ironed out! Not a happy user, and I avoid this app at all costs.",1
2013-09-06 13:42:48,Procurement project manager,Good app for mobile devices. Ease of use is high and overall functionality is comparable to the website. No issues. Mobile app allows me to use service much more frequently than website on PC.,5
2013-09-05 20:03:37,LinkedIn is Excellent!,"LinkedIn has quickly become my go to resource for identifying and performing my initial contact with possible employees I wish to hire.

It's has everything... Download the application to stay on the go and still stay ahead of the game.",5
2013-08-04 14:13:28,DISGRACEFUL - TOO MUCH SPAM,"I have tried multiple times to unsubscribe from email lists, however I find it impossible to get this company to stop spamming me. What happens is I unsubscribe to all communications, then a month later, I start getting emails again and find out one of my email settings had been turned back on. I should report this kind of behavior to the better business bureau. This is unwarranted, unethical, and simply disgraceful that a $20bn Internet company behaves in this manner.",1
2013-06-08 22:32:56,Hard to Believe the Power of Connections,What else really can be said about the more professional side of the social networks sphere. What I can say is its hard to believe just how good this app is. Business connections at your fingertips and the possibilities are endless,5
2013-05-31 00:14:10,Consumer,"After reviewing a number of fellow users reviews I feel better that my critique won't be as harsh as others. The UI is weak, it seems as though the company is in someway attempting to compete with Facebook but keep in wrapped in the business flag. I'd fire the head of creative and start over. The app has actually become more cumbersome than its worth, which is a disappointing statement. I was an avid supporter of the platform before it became de-facebooked.....",2
2013-05-24 12:12:42,Awful,"Most of the time just sits on a blank screen with no indicator that anything is loading. When the stars are properly aligned, it opens your page, but it won't allow any editing.  Of course it SAYS it does allow editing, but if you try to change any information it says to please fill out the required fields to save. There are no indicators of what is a required field, so I tried filling in each box and got the same result.  This app needs some work.",1
2013-04-20 10:46:54,Stinks,"This is one of the worst apps I've ever seen from what purports to be a high-end, technologically savvy company.  It is almost impossible to leave a comment with the program. It takes forever to load and the interface is a confusing mess.

Time for them to go back to the drawing board, like Facebook did. Till then, I'm sticking with the web browser interface and having to put up with the stupid reminders to use this horrible program space every time I do.",1
2013-04-19 02:06:19,Top notch app,"Top notch app that's very polished and clean.  It lets you do most things the desktop version does.  I really like the new version with the news front and center.

LinkedIn has helped me with employment too.  The reviews and kudos are definitely helpful at interview time!",5
2012-09-25 15:40:42,Good app....one foible,"The linked in app on iPhone is good....intuitive, pretty fast.  One issue: when you get an email notification of se LinkedIn activity, the link takes u to a login page.  Selecting the app directly automatically logs u in.   Seems like it ought to be smart enough, from an email link, to send u straight thru to the app.",4
2013-03-29 17:10:51,Waste of Time,"This app has the worst user experience I have ever seen. UI is confusing, and doesn't help the user find what they are looking for. E.g., in the messages section it was not clear where to look for all the mail. Also, I had pending notifications in email which were not showing up in the messages queue. Not sure why LinkedIn went with the fancy sections, but a normal tab bar would have worked ok for their interface. They really need to simplify the UI.",1
2013-02-26 03:19:14,No app is better than releasing an app that disappoints,"I'm a human person. What do I care about most?  ME!!  Ok, I think I'll let the world know a little about ME.  I open my iPad app to edit my profile. Wow, sometimes I'm really slow. How do I edit profile?  I know it has to be here, somewhere...  Because this is ONLY THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON TO USE LINKEDIN.  What?  Edit Profile functionality didn't make it into Functional Requirements for this project?  How is that possible?  How can the app owners and app developers be that out of touch?",1
2012-12-24 00:44:37,Needs updated for iPad,Just wrote a comment & got an error said try later what is that. Also the key board hides the comment area no matter what direction the screen is. Please fix these issues. Comments are not in time order when someone as relayed to you it should be in order but you have to look around for the last post.,3
2016-10-07 12:28:41,Beneficial app,"I just want to say if you're looking to network with others within your field or seek help from other fields, LinkedIn is the place to do so. Shared articles, photos, and ideas. Also, a great way to find a job is looking. Direct access to the hiring department or manager related to the job title.",4
2012-09-09 23:11:01,Totally USELESS!,"I have been a linked in user for many years. This app gets worse with each release. I am a member of many linked in groups. When I get a notification email and click on the link it goes to the infuriating ""download the app"" screen. It used to recognize that I had the app installed. Now it just hangs on a startup screen and never loads the app. I have tried it with the linked in app open and closed. Same result. Totally useless for a devoted linked in user.",1
2012-09-01 05:24:24,Love the new UI,"I deleted the app a long time ago because I just never really used it. I just re-downloaded and I have to say WOW! The UI updates are amazing. Not sure that all of it is super intuitive, but it's not difficult and it is a huge improvement. Great job!",5
2012-04-19 17:26:52,Great for conferences and meetings!,I downloaded this app while at a science meeting. Great for finding people quickly. They really have made a lot of changes since the early versions and it's great now. Everything is fluid and intuitive.,5
2012-02-16 04:49:26,Awesome,So far so good. 90% of the functionality of the actual site ported into the mobile app....but where it lacks extensive feature control it makes up in mobile usability....notification pushes and the such. Im a happy lil camper :),5
2011-11-28 18:47:19,Pretty cool but you can't edit your profile.,"When I first opened this app I was very impressed with how clean and creative the interface of this app was. It is very fluid. However you cannot edit your profile and or manage your photo! This is very disappointing considering how impressive the rest of the app seems to be. I hope this functionality is added later on,,,, I would then give this app 4 or 5 stars.",2
2011-10-13 04:25:06,Great Upgrade,"This updates app has me reaching out to many colleagues and associates from the past. I have received many new requests as well. It's not just about growing your network, it's much more about reconnecting with former colleagues to talk about business. Great update!",5
2011-10-04 13:42:26,Need to be able to update profiles,"3 stars because they need to enable the feature so we can update our profiles on the go. That is where i spend the most time when on linkedin. Otherwise i love the ""people you might know"" feature and the fact that you can keep messages as unread if you want. Getting there!",3
2011-08-24 03:34:38,Love the update! BUT....,"Give us an option to upload a photo from the app. Unless I am missing it... I do not see an option to change the profile image. 

Navigating the app is easy and I find myself using my LinkedIn account.",5
2009-12-30 10:01:39,Invitations are NOT working!,"I d/l the update recently and everytime I go to accept an invitation, I get a message that there was an error and that an ""error report was sent."" Sent where? And if they keep getting sent, why is it STILL not working days later?!! It's maddening to see these invitations pile up and not be able to do anything about them (at least from the iphone version)!!",2
2017-10-01 04:36:53,So incredibly helpful in keeping up with friends and colleagues.,I absolutely love this Avenue and the ability to see what my colleagues are doing. Love it it continues to stay professional and that it passes along the right amount of information.,5
2017-09-07 15:29:09,Incredibly convenient and versatile,"I love this app!!! It gives me the alerts I want/prefer, minimal ads (I have a Premium membership), and pertinent job alerts. Love love love it. (I also love how you can't do EVERYTHING on it and that some security-managed tasks need to be handled on a desktop.)",5
2017-08-11 13:36:52,Good App,"I think it's a great app. I can connect with almost anyone I've worked with. I do think they could do more on the job seeker side of things but overall it's a solid app. Doesn't crash,  messages, and notifications are instantaneous.",5
2017-08-03 13:26:24,"Easy, intuitive, Smooth","This app is so helpful as it points out areas of interest, recent activity, and pending actions recommended. Simple to make posts, connection, read, access sites, and check your stats.",5
2017-07-01 08:15:25,Consistent Progress,I have been a user of LinkedIn for years now and it's great to see how it continues to get better. It is one of the more mature platforms in social media. A great tool for professional networking and informative posts. Two thumbs up!,5
2016-11-14 08:34:31,Love it!,"I read all the previous reviews and is seems most people are unable to use this app, however, I have had absolutely no issues with it. Therefore I find it extremely useful and informative.",5

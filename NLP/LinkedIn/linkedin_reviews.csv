2023-09-30 00:42:10,Zalak Patel is a consummate PROFESSIONAL,"I hired Zalak to design my site based on two criteria: 1 She had a very fine portfolio. 2. More importantly, she asked me for my business, then asked again, then asked again.  I said yes and for the next year, was never sorry for a single moment.  First, she is a highly skilled and wonderful designer with an eye for art that is hard to find. 2. She has common sense and approaches her design as a customer centered business understanding that in the end, I needed to be satisfied and happy with her product, for her to be happy with her job; 3. I can absolutely trust her with my site, including passwords, and project funding (she was not only a designer but a great project manager). 4. She set me up with her own programmers in which I paid her and she paid them. She guaranteed them and she got what she wanted from the without damaging the site. (Something I had a hard time doing).  I found Zalak to be pleasant and personable.  She was always on time and always dependable and always did what she told me she would do.  I have hired dozens of talented off-shore programmers/designers and few do I give a recommendation and none do I give a full throated recommendation to, except to Zalak.  Call me any time in Missouri to talk to me.",5
2023-02-01 01:55:07,Love LinkedIn! But the app…,"Update: LinkedIn heard my prayers and fixed my app. I no longer get kicked out when trying to send direct messages, and the app works generally faster. Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to utilize this awesome app to its fullest potential again! 

Let me start out by saying that LinkedIn has changed my life in so many positive ways. I found my new career through the app, and started down a journey of positive personal development when I rejoined the platform. Hence the four stars. I needed to take one star away because, at least in the app, it almost always crashes and boots me out when I try to send a Direct Message to someone. I end up needing to go in and retype the message 2-3 times before it will send without crashing and closing out. I know plenty of other people are experiencing the same problem, because they post about it. Please fix this issue, I love this platform for so many reasons, but this is frustrating! Thank you in advance for your attention and all that you do to make LinkedIn the wonderful place that it is! Update: my app has worked perfectly since the last update. No more getting booted out when sending DMs. Thank you LinkedIn!",5
2023-10-25 11:39:30,Better as a creator,"LinkedIn was okay until I became a creator. It takes courage to post but over time, like 3-6 months, it becomes easier. At that point it becomes a lot more fun and now I look forward to using LinkedIn and this app every day. 

Not sure what to write? Use the 2 year, 2 day, or even 2 hour rule (credit Nicolas Cole). Just post what you would have benefited from had you known it 2 years ago, 2 days ago, or even 2 minutes ago!

Developers: thanks for your work on the app!! First request: wish the scheduled posts could be edited. Second request: wish commenting was just better organized for conversations. Like replying to a reply to a reply. Also wish that the best answers/comments filtered to the top. Would draw you in as a user to know that the first comments are the most valued by the community (when there are dozens of comments and you don’t want to sift through them all). Again thanks though for the great app!",5
2021-06-25 23:06:36,Need Auto-Saving for Drafts,"I spent about an hour carefully crafting a reply to a message, had assembled a bunch of links and useful information for the recipient, and had to navigate away from the app momentarily to grab a link. When I switched back to LinkedIn, the app opened to the main landing page and when I reopened the message I had been composing a reply to, the text field was empty. I lost an hour of work and I feel so frustrated, distraught, and disheartened. Auto-save for in-progress messages is pretty basic functionality for most messaging programs and if your app had had it, I wouldn’t be in this situation. I wish I could setup a LinkedIn auto-response that directs everyone who messages through LinkedIn me to contact me on a different interface, so that I could avoid using LinkedIn’s messaging tool entirely. 

Objectively, the app is basically fine aside from this issue and does not really deserve only one star. I’m just still reeling from the emotional blow of this experience and looking for an outlet for my frustration as well as to share this feedback with you while it’s fresh and in a way that will help your team feel the pain that can be caused by this product gap and really understand the impact. Thanks for reading.",1
2021-09-21 15:30:25,Unprofessional customer service and inaccurate algorithms,After using the application for quite a while that I have added too many connections that I have never talked to. So recently I was trying to clean up those connections. Because I didn’t find any option to delete all unused connections all at once so I just manually deleted them. All of sudden I received an system notification that I was using a third party software and restricted for log in in 1 hour. I was so frustrated that I never used anything like that and I was just simply cleaning up my unused connections. I mean if LinkedIn has the option to let me delete them all at once then I don’t need to manually delete one by one and create a ‘high volume’ as they claimed. It is the inaccurate algorithms that mark me as something called ‘using the the third party software’. In fact I don’t even know there exists this kind of third party software. The customer representative was like this is a done deal that you are using the 3rd party software and any tickets regarding to this would be closed automatically. So LinkedIn made a mistake that they don’t admit it. And the customer has no right to point it out! See this is the way how they treat their customers!,1
2023-08-26 04:46:05,Out of all the Options,"They are the most thorough platform available, full of many different types of new beginnings. However, I have not had quality customer support experiences with them. I have been trying to utilize a benefit that they offer veterans for some time now, and something is not working, but when I reach out to them for assistance, I get very little other than a vague response. I have contacted them on several occasions, but it’s still a mystery to me why this opportunity continues to elude me. I have given up hope, and I rarely use (or try to) the site anymore because of this. It makes me sad because I don’t have the resources and abilities I once possessed, and this is the best place for me to focus on what I CAN do and learn about new opportunities. I was looking forward to this being the beginning of the most lucrative and rewarding career in my lifetime. Yet, I have hit another stumbling block instead.",3
2023-10-27 14:36:21,Will not save profile picture,"I have tried on my web browser on my laptop and in the LinkedIn App, and the system will not allow me to save a profile picture. It will let me upload a photo, edit it with cropping and filters, and hit the “save” button, but the photo does not save. In the web browser, the “save” grays out after I press it and does nothing else. If I then close the edit window, it warns that my changes have not been saved and gives only the option to discard changes and close the window or to cancel and return to the editing screen. In the App, if I press save, it comes up with a “saving” message and the wheel spins for about 3 seconds, then the entire app crashes and shuts down. Pretty worthless app if it doesn’t even function well enough to put in a profile picture. 

My other limited experiences with the app have also been negative. When trying to edit education history and work history, the app is clunky and sometimes slow to respond. It is also hard to predict where in your profile the info you are entering is going to actually show.",2
2023-09-11 12:47:38,API calls make UI stall,"Extremely buggy on iOS on iPhone 12 max. I’ve deleted the app and reinstalled. There’s some very badly managed API calls that feel like it’s using jQuery instead of a modern MVC framework causing every other scroll to click instead. I don’t understand why it became so much worse, or how QA engineers let this out the door. It’s very badly managed developers and software. This was not an issue at all a couple years ago, shortly after Microsoft bought LinkedIn. It is however unsurprising that the UI became much worse after MS got involved and MS has no design cycle nor do they have a QA cycle so it’s absolutely likely the UI will continue to get worse. Sigh, hopefully I’ll land a job so I don’t need to use this broken and frustrating UI much longer. The most frustrating part it I tried to tell LinkedIn and the customer support claimed the couldn’t replicate, which is funny because I tested on several iPhones. It’s gaslighting on their part. The whole customer support experience also reminded e of Microsoft, where thy just don’t believe you and assume the customer is doing something wrong. I don’t think they want to fix it.",1
2022-04-15 17:47:13,linkedin (and the rest of social media) has become terrible,"after being a paying premium linkedin member for years, my account was suddenly deleted by linkedin simply because i chose to talk openly with others on it about being treated for sickness i’ve dealt with that was related to the moderna vaccine - and trying to spread helpful information to others who may experience the same issue. i’m also a single parent trying to find work ASAP after the past two years of struggle. linkedin has been deleting actual doctors who have been trying to help with this stuff as well. it’s clear the people in linkedin’s trust & safety department don’t care about any of this and have joined the insane groupthink cult governing too many of these companies now, censoring anyone who might displease their advertisers, even to their userbase’s detriment. the fact that linkedin has started using engagement and suppression algorithms like twitter and facebook is making it an increasingly more toxic environment as well. i’ve switched to indeed. linkedin has become absolutely inhumane and will sink its own ship if this is how it continues to conduct business.",1
2022-08-15 05:59:38,please read,"I downloaded this app on my phone just so i could advise everyone not to use this website. For a senior project in my AP english class, everyone needs to create a LinkedIn account. Everything was going fine and I had spent about 3 hours working on the profile and only had about an hour or less of work left to do. The next day, I go to log in and there is an error message that says I need to submit ID due to suspicious activity. I talk to my teacher and this seems to be a problem with many other students. She contacts LinkedIn and they said it was due to a mass login on the same internet, and it will be fixed soon. The next day, very few students were still locked out, including me. I submitted my drivers license. The day after that, I was one of two students locked out. Skip a few days (3), and they FINALLY respond to me saying my account is permanently banned. I am now drastically behind in my class and this program is going to ultimately lead to my failure in this college class. I hope you guys fix your support team and maybe look at issues a little deeper before banning people.",1
2022-06-07 14:41:17,"Not able to access on cellular, only WiFi",I recently transferred Service from Verizon to AT&T. The LinkedIn app only works on Wi-Fi it does not work connected to cellular service. I have gone through all of the troubleshooting steps with AT&T as well as Apple. I’m on an iPhone 13 Pro. Everyone has said it is not an issue on their end that I should contact the developer. Please advise if there is some thing I can do to make this app push through on cellular service. The app is up-to-date with what’s available in the App Store for me.

2022-09-19 08:02:26,Atrocious customer service,"After being charged over $600 for a product I didn’t realize I even bought due to their confusing interface I am being refused a refund and sent the same generic message about their no refund policy over and over again. I have used this website for years and am appalled by their dishonest practice. If you decide to ever use this website or app don’t ever buy premium (it’s useless) and don’t ever put your card information on it or you might fall victim to what I’m going through. They make it too easy ti misinterpret something and buy something with an insane price tag without realizing what you’re agreeing to. The app is also poorly designed as well. If you check Trust Pilot and the Better Business Bureau, they have a one star rating which is a huge red flag. Personally I would say avoid at all costs and don’t ever give them any if your information except for the bare minimum. Don’t expect a transparent app, business practice or to ever any kind of real conversation with customer service. Avoid at all cost but if you must use it Keep your expectations extremely low.",1
2022-01-15 16:11:33,"One step forward, ten steps back","Updating my review (Jan 15, 2022): Everything below PLUS app freezes when trying to post or upload a photo. (Yes, I deleted and reinstalled.) No such thing as tech help from what I can see. Just consumer forums and FAQs. Down to 1 star and deleting from my phone. 

——

I used to enjoy this app, but it seems that it is getting less and less user-friendly on iPad and iPhone. For example, the landing page and profile page do not mirror the most important features that are on the laptop version. It would be nice to be able to easily view my recent updates and make changes to all of my profile sections--not just certain ones--from the app. A new thing I've noticed now is that some articles or links can't be opened in browser or forwarded through email/text. The ""forward"" arrow icon pops up with a ""cancel"" message instead and no other option. So weird. Sadly, the ""app support"" is just a forum of somewhat useless info, which is why I'm posting here. Hopefully the designers will read everyone's feedback on App Store and correct these issues in next update.",1
2023-03-29 19:36:19,Social Connect NOT for CAREER seekers or EMPLOYMENT hopefuls,"ONLY use for a self propped social site to highlight career accomplishments, this is in NO way a site assisting with career, employment, job, or training for such in any way. I don’t believe anyone in it’s history actually found or obtained relevant employment by association with this site. The app is disgraceful with countless & continuous problems, the functions, features & customizations are only there to frustrate since no real functionality, majority if not all content from being contacted will be not or scam derived with no reportable solution for removal. If you have the time to waste, money to flush for the Pro version yet love advertisement inserts along with pro paying versions, lack of responsive support services & never getting much in return then you Will absolutely adore & promote this bug infested nightmare…there’s way better available if a serious job seeker, career hopeful & educated enough to avoid this mess individual or business looking for hires. Hope this fades from App Store listings & internet history quickly for everyone’s sake, the world could only improve for it doing so.",1
2022-07-16 16:40:09,LinkedIn engages in profiling through barring certain searches,"While I have benefitted from certain services that LinkedIn provides such as LinkedIn learning, LinkedIn no longer appears to serve the individual user as much as it serves corporate recruiting efforts and corporate advertising.
I work for a large educational system, which by this time has hundreds and hundreds of individual users with LinkedIn profiles, and while manually searching through a number of these profiles, the software app recently tried to force me into signing an agreement that I would voluntarily limit future searches through my own organizational network for others to connect with to a certain undisclosed, arbitrary number chosen by LinkedIn without any further information from LinkedIn to me or face suspension of my account by the app. The software has not allowed me any further access to my own profile until I sign that agreement. I strongly recommend avoiding this glorified recruitment service in favor of other newer, more personable services which allow the user to be more in control of his or her own searches.",1
2022-04-20 06:47:21,Racist platform - sells your ID on the Dark Web,"When I first joined LinkedIn I had support help me consolidate two accounts and that wasn’t an issue. Then because I debated some racists and debunked their lies, LinkedIn decided I was the guilty party and suspended my account. They demanded a copy of my ID front and back and/or passport. My identity could’ve been verified through my contacts who are high level attorneys, CEOs and even the Chamber of Commerce of which I am a member and LinkedIn sees that. They refused to reinstate my account. They’re racists as revealed by an article in NY Times in 2019! 

I then created another account and rebuilt my profile. After a while LinkedIn seeing I was getting a lot of traction to my posts restricted my account again this time claiming I had two accounts AND I NEEDED to provide a passport or ID again! These people are insane! Suddenly my credit report warned that my email address was compromised and was found on the dark web! Guess who did this? Yes, LinkedIn. This company is a racist lying bunch of thieves and you should really avoid it at all cost. It’s no longer the professional platform it once was.",1
2018-03-27 05:14:36,Serious VoiceOver accessibility problems,"I am a blind person using the screen reader voiceover for iOS and I am having some serious VoiceOver accessibility problems. For one thing, in the new version, when I double tap on my Contacts, the app crashes every time. Secondly, when I am browsing through my people you may know section, the app get slower and slower and slower the longer eyebrows. Thirdly, if you were using voiceover, there is no option to remove someone from your people you may know list so that you do not see them anymore. The accessibility problems with this app used to be somewhat minimal. I am really looking forward to seeing this app fixed and using LinkedIn again. It is one of my favorite social networking platforms.  I apologize if other people are bored by this review, but LinkedIn also does not have any where in the app or on the app support page to provide feedback about the app. I would also be kind of nice if developer of LinkedIn provided details about its updates in its release notes, but many App developers don’t do this. It’s just a pet peeve.",2
2019-06-13 21:38:07,Horrible Interface,"I swear this site has provided me with so much stress just trying to set it up. I didn’t dropped out of college and I left my job but they are both in my interests and I cannot change them. Whenever I open the app it tells me to finish updating my profile but I don’t have anymore information to add. There’s no way to say no. When I tried to leave things blank because they don’t apply to me I couldn’t. I got a notice that I had shown up in a search but when I opened the notification I was taken to a page within the app that did not work without a laptop. Why would this happen on the mobile app? It makes no sense. I’ve made all the connections I want to for now but every time I open the app I have to skip through the page to make connections with random people I don’t know. This app and the website are infuriating to attempt to use. I use all kinds of other social media that work at least decently. This platform is by far the most angering to use. Maybe the team is overworked or has no time to fix these issues, but they are too glaring and long lasting to still be around.",1
2023-06-17 20:15:01,Terrible tech support as a professional platform,"LinkedIn closed my account for absolutely no reason.

After I’ve updated the Linkedin App, I was asked to re-login, but instead of logging into my existing account, it created a new profile for me, completely blank. I was confused at first but was still able to search up my old account and thought of it as a tech glitch. I reached out to the service team and waited a few days before reaching out again, after they said they’ll transfer my case to another team. By now I can no longer find my old account and am panicking, since it contains all my connections and the profile that I’ve built long and hard for.

The team responded saying my account is restricted permanently for misrepresenting my identity, after I’ve provided my ID, and closed my case with no other details. Now I’m stuck with no information and a brand new account and no access to any of my past connections. I have offered the team to provide any relevant info to verify my past work/volunteering experiences, but I am just greatly disappointed by LinkedIn tech support.

I’ve been patience since the start and comply with the rules, despite the great inconvenience that this has caused me work-wise, but I’m simply frustrated now that I may never get my account back for absolutely no reason. Apparently this has been an issue for many people and I don’t understand why it continues to be one, being one of the most professional platform used by thousands.",1
2021-05-19 01:27:07,Only sort of useful,"An account is basically required by potential employers if you’re applying to white collar jobs, but is incredibly difficult to sort thru or actually get a response from companies- especially if you are applying thru linkedin itself. Would recommend only using the app to find companies that sound interesting, vetting them thru glassdoor, then applying via the company website itself.
Suggestion 1 for better UX: limit applications to 100 per job with job listings closing automatically upon hitting 100 apps received. I am tired of seeing open job listings with 100+ applicants because i KNOW that the hiring managers are only skimming the top 5% of applicants from the pile and then underpaying them for their experience. 
Suggestion 2 for better UX: Years of required experience being listed as a filter within job listings search. I am not interested in a job that pays entry level wages or says “fast paced environment” and then requires 5-7 years of experience AND a bachelors.",2
2023-09-26 21:14:20,Privacy,"LinkedIn excels as a premier platform for professional networking and career advancement, proving indispensable for job seekers and employers alike. It offers a rich array of features and a user-friendly interface that facilitates dynamic interactions and professional development. 
💡 However, it could significantly benefit from enhanced privacy settings, allowing users to conceal the start dates of their career experiences to combat the prevalent issue of ageism in the professional realm. 

Just like in the education section of a user's profile, this added flexibility would enable individuals to showcase their skills and experiences without the constraint of timelines, promoting a more inclusive professional environment. Overall, LinkedIn stands as a powerful tool for career progression, but adopting more nuanced privacy features would further its commitment to fostering equitable and diverse professional communities.",4
2020-08-17 17:02:17,Notification Issues,"I’m a job seeker and I’ve been using LinkedIn to aid in my search. However, I’m afraid of missing a job opportunity as whenever I get a push notification I never hear any sound, unlike with my other apps. I always see a red number on my LinkedIn app widget showing me how many new notifications I have however I never hear any sound. All other sounds seem to be working which leads me to believe it’s an app issue rather than a phone issue or operator error somewhere. Please help! Thanks!

Also, unless I’m just missing it, I would LOVE the ability to select a custom notification sound within the app so I can identify a LinkedIn notification from all others. Thank you! Be safe!

Oh! One thing I did forget to add is that I LOVE the section called “My Next Job Should Offer Me” where we’re able to specify benefits we’re asking for as well as the schedule we need. Oh and the Name Pronunciation feature is fantastic!!! Thank you!!!",3
2023-09-16 20:19:37,Need more options,"When a job expires I can’t see it on the app only on the actual website. 
There’s to be a way to archive old jobs that I’ve applied to. 
When applying to jobs externally it reroutes you to a different web browser entirely so you don’t lose your application. 
Is there a way to add quick swipe left so when there’s a job that you’re not interested in you can hide it?
It would also be nice to add a filter to where you can check “see only see United States jobs available for anyone in the United States and the state you live in for remote jobs instead of the app showing for example “Chicago, IL United States” and you can apply for these jobs because the job poster only wants candidates from that area state. This would make job searching a lot faster.",4
2023-07-03 09:12:53,Show me your papers! Repeatedly suspended.,"I have used LinkedIn for the last time. There is so much effort in building a LinkedIn profile and like other texh giants,"" they"" have the ability to suspend one's account. It may be automatic, it may be AI or it may be someone clicking buttons. It could have been me making a joke, asking, ""What? No fact chexking?"" to a post where someone said, ""Wrong is wrong, even if everybody is doing it and right is right, even if nobody is doing it."" Whatever the reason, they have shown me repeatedly that this is not a platform that I can trust or depend on when I need it. I resisted giving them my government issued ID to regain access to my account, the last time this happened and eventually, ""I Loved Big Brother,"" like at the end of 1984. I sent them
my ID and they still did not unlock my account. The promose was broken and was just a lie. They feel that they have power over us but it only works if we cooperate.",2
2019-11-19 17:50:15,Changes to LinkedIn.,"I too am very disappointed with LinkedIn and the direction it has taken. 
This previously was a great site for people to communicate with other people and companies. Whether it was trying to get a job, improving their position, finding a new workplace due to moving to a new area or trying to move up to a better job, talking with others about how to improve their job skills so they can prepare for a better job or keeping in touch with friends they worked with in the past or, even better, finding old friends and learning how to stay in touch with them. It WAS a great site. 
Now, as the previous commenter said, LinkedIn is now just another Facebook or Twitter. It’s totally lost all the professionalism it started with. 
If anyone in power within the LinkedIn organization reads this comment, please, please, PLEASE change the format back to what the original people or person had as their vision. If you don’t, I can foresee this site going down the tubes. I, for one, will do my best to start a new site with only one goal... to make a website for companies and individuals to get together and help each other grow both as a company and as individuals who want to help a company grow and a company willing to help their dedicated individuals grow within the company. 
Also, have learning institutions small and large contribute to the individuals growth.
Is anyone out there with me on this?",2
2021-07-08 22:41:42,Needs improvement,I was just trying to apply to a job on LinkedIn. They said to contact the employer by email and provided the email. When I press and hold LinkedIn does not allow you to select text to copy and paste into your mail. The email is also not a link I can click on to email. I unfortunately have to manually type in the long email letter by letter going back and fourth. Please fix this. I was also recently searching for jobs and reading a number of job descriptions. Many were in my field but did not apply to me. I would like to be able to hide them so I don’t see them in the future. Don’t see a way to do this. I only see Apply and Save buttons; no hide. When viewing a clients portfolio web link and clicking on it nothing happens within LinkedIn. This link should open up in Safari; I can not copy/paste it into Safari either and have to go back and fourth typing letter by letter.,2
2019-06-17 21:25:14,The absolute worst networking app...,"LinkedIn is the absolute worst, corrupt, and non user friendly social app out there. There are too many reasons to even begin mentioning all of them. Just to name one: if a user wants to unfriend or leave a group, LinkedIn intentionally makes it impossible to do so on the mobile app.

I’m also still dealing with a “glitch” that the app had a few years ago. Without giving any permission to access my iPhone’s contacts, LinkedIn automatically dumped every one of my LinkedIn contacts into my iPhone’s contacts. Well over 500 contacts were combined with my personal contacts. Not a big deal you say? Well those contacts birthdays were then automatically also added to iPhone’s calendar. Everyday I would have at least a couple of these birthdays showing. For well over a year I was manually removing these contacts one name at a time. LinkedIn admitted to the error. Thanks that did nothing to help. So at this point I have zero trust in the integrity, honesty, or reliability of LinkedIn.",1
2018-12-14 00:13:49,Chronological content feed - second attempt.,"LinkedIn... I love your platform. I have already posted a comment on the lack of a sort by “recent” function on for iOS. When I’m on my phone, the work around is to go to your mobile site, then request the desktop site, then select “sort by: recent”. The most recent update you just pushed out now has “lives” or something that feels like a clone of Instagram/YouTube/Snapchat/Facebook, etc. I do not subscribe to these platforms because I believe LinkedIn is the only social media platform of any substance. There is quality content and networking happening everyday. Why did your newest update add a cookie-cutter “lives” function and not a simple “sort by:recent” function. Why am I seeing 3 week old posts with recent posts scattered about. Totally ridiculous... The one platform I thought was doing a service to a community of professional people is slowly becoming just another social media platform.",2

That’s never happened to me before and there’s no reason stating what “suspicious activity” is being done? Even to get help as in a support ticket, or via email, you have to sign in but I CAN’T because my account is banned for no apparent reason! You guys need to seriously state the specific reasons as to why accounts are banned because I haven’t done anything but use your guys clarify app to get verified and also apply to jobs and post my degree so what’s the reason I’m so called “banned” for? Your customer service is horrible as well.. they’re should definitely be an easier way to contact someone other than being a member because you ban us for no reason and it’s impossible getting a hold of you guys. At that, it doesn’t even state WHEN our accounts will be off banned mode or how long it takes for them to verify. It’s ridiculous. I wouldn’t recommend this app.",1

2023-06-27 19:05:04,Bad SEO,"This app is really frustrating to use. When looking at a company’s open roles, I can’t filter by location because it will just reset the search to all jobs in that location, not restricting to the company whose page I was just on. If I try to restrict further by searching the company name, all these unrelated jobs show up in the search. This doesn’t happen on desktop so I’m not sure why it’s happening on mobile. 
Also the filters aren’t very functional - so many jobs that are included in the “entry level” filter but require 7+ years experience, or are marked as fully remote but are actually fully in person. The jobs I’m recommended aren’t even close to the field or function of my current roles. My home feed is just full of fake inspirational posts about CEOs deigning to give their employees breadcrumbs and people foaming at the mouth over their “generosity”. It’s not a good tool anymore.",2
2021-12-26 04:08:09,eh,"I honestly have never written a review before, but I left LinkedIn because of this when I was fond of building connections on LinkedIn. However,  someone had to make me very uncomfortable. LinkedIn is for professional use. When posting, there should be a  sensitivity filter so what ever comment or post is being shared on LinkedIn directly is not hurtful or disrespectful. I had a horrible experience with someone disrespecting my profession and the person said “in ms your considered a joke” on my post that involved my profession having an appreciation week. 
That is the total opposite of what LinkedIn in is used for.

Update: it’s sad to see that my review was overlooked and not cared about. Bullying or any form of making someone uncomfortable especially on a professional job app should be taken seriously. You should be able to post about your profession without someone trying to undermine a position. What a shame.
Adding on to my review: I hope LinkedIn is able to talk with him, and give him a warning. 
It’s sad because I did not want to leave LinkedIn, but because of this behavior that should not be tolerated I left and it was probably for the best. I just wanted to be recognized for all the hard work I do for my job and post it on my page and someone had to ruin it all. I know it’s not you LinkedIn, but I hope you can help me.",2
2020-01-03 00:26:58,Horrible,The newest update has them limiting your preferences for your job search an forcibly showing you state wide jobs like that helps. If  someone like myself has set up job preferences why take them away and why start showing jobs to them that are outside of their preferences like a job search isn't already hard enough and tiring enough. Now I'm every time I open the app instead of being able to scroll through the recommendations I have to create different searches because the jobs recommended to me are 8+ hours away and don't interest me in the slightest. Just because I live in a state doesn't mean I'm comfortable commuting far and doesn't mean I'm trying to relocate to the opposite side of it. So who's dumb idea was it to add that useless and annoying feature that shows jobs to people outside their now very limited preferences. I don't want to be shown state wide jobs and according to the customer service rep it's a feature I can't manually get rid of. Dumbest update to date.,1
2020-04-18 14:34:58,Please add an unlimited word count,"I love LinkedIn, but would like to see an unlimited word count.  There are so many times that I have a post that exceeds the allotted word count and it’s frustrating.  I could condense what i need to say most times, but sometimes I need to be able to say more than what LinkedIn allows.  

If the post is good, people will read it. If not, they don’t have to read it and can just scroll on past.  I’m sure if you took a poll from other LinkedIn users, you would find that most of them would agree that LinkedIn needs an unlimited word count.  Don’t limit it solely for the purpose of making sure people’s posts are shorter.  Give people the opportunity to add as much as they need to their posts.  Sometimes you need to be able to add more to your post to properly say what you need to say because tightening your word count doesn’t always cut it.",3
2018-01-16 01:51:49,Option to improve feed needs to be improved,"The app is solid and very easy to use. My complaints are the content in the Feed and that the option “improve my feed” really offers no real options except adding new people to follow. It should be flexible and let you choose what you want to see more of OR less of. For example, in my feed I don't need to see every single time a connection “likes” something. I also remember I always used to see when my current connections connected to new people. I used to see those a lot every day. That was helpful info if a contact connected to someone new in my industry. It worked well in conjunction with the other “people I may know” info. I almost never see those types of updates anymore in my feed. Can you explain why the feed offers me zero flexibility to see the things that are most important to me?",3
2023-06-07 16:48:52,The app for fake people,"Most of the content I’ve encountered on this app is fake. Fake people with their fake jobs and fake integrity awards. No. These are the lowest most untrustworthy people on the planet.  Sorry but I can’t play your charades. The job section is a hot mess. More fake advertisements than Indeed and that’s hard to beat. Then you have a bunch of fake made of companies with their websites that took them under and hour to make. Are people still being fooled? Most of the jobs that are real are expired and outdated or closed. It just a stalker app. Provides no real business connections or opportunities.
if you try to delete the profile they still want to advertise you for up to 2 more weeks. Sorry but when I delete you no longer have the option to do anything with my personal information. This app is useless. Just people spying on me or sending odd spam email. I can’t wait until I figure out how to reclaim my information from these jerks!",1
2023-04-27 15:28:21,Needs improvement FIX FIX FIX,"It’s driving me bananas but if you search for a job and put one of the filters on (company, date posted, industry, function etc) sometimes if you put a second filter on, it will remove the first filter. Please please please fix this. I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max and am running the newest IOS software. It is driving me crazy.

Also!! When you go to select “company” there are many companies that you are able to choose from or you can search for one, you should make one of the defaults be the company the person is currently at or ones that they search a lot not random jobs. It doesn’t make sense why the default ones aren’t based on frequency. 

I don’t understand how such a powerful and renown company can have so many bugs with their searching features. Hire more engineers. It’s unfortunate there is nothing like LinkedIn because I would love to use anything that doesn’t make me want to rip my hair out.",1
2022-04-30 14:51:14,Atrocious Algorithms,"I’ve wasted my time for years with Indeed trying to search for jobs, and most of the wasted time is related to having to get through the pile of unrelated jobs thrown at me without any relevance to my job search. It doesn’t matter how deeply I attempt to tweak my search, get rid of unrelated jobs or even supply comments to this company as to why their jobs are irrelevant - they keep on sending jobs that have absolutely no connection to my search criteria. Indeed could apply a significant fix by limiting job results to only those which have the exact match in the job title, but that’s not an option. Why not? Because Indeed gets paid for the number of times a job shows up in a search, not whether it has no relevance. “Failed algorithms which waste job seekers time” - I suspect that this is the vision statement for Indeed. I depend on LinkedIn instead, and so should everyone else: Same jobs, but less wasted time and effort.",1
2021-07-09 02:32:50,What is going on !!!!,"I’m a huge fan of LinkedIn but Im unable to access anything right now!!! I am not unable to respond to my messages, or update anything….as soon as I try I am forced to open the app that at first said I didn’t have an account so I reset my password….. even though I just had it open online…. now the app won’t open because it’s prompting me to fill out a page about my future job hopes and dreams that goes blank when I attempt to response. I don’t understand why I can’t use my online account anymore apps aren’t dependable!! All I wanted to do is update my resume and read some articles! I apologize for my frustration I know it’s an app thing! Please please please fix this issue!!!",5
2019-12-11 14:48:05,Feel abandoned,"My LI app will no longer run, I'm forced to upgrade the app, but my iPhone doesn't support the new minimum de for the latest app. Sad LI made that decision to not support earlier sw versions :( and being in transition spending $1k on new phone isn't the smartest idea right now. Laptop only going forward :(

Still abandoned- their support said delete app and reload, there was hope as when I was reloading it said that it would load the sw that was compatible with my phone and that some features may not work. Ha, who knew the feature that wouldn't work was the app itself... they have a screen that comes up stating ""update for the latest sw"" but you can't get out of that loop, my phone doesn't support latest iPhone sw so it can't get the latest LI download. A silly loop they could correct if they wanted, I guess they don't want to, they closed my case because I didn't respond back in the hour, like all I have to do is mess with this app, ugh. Now you know why I feel abandoned...",1
2019-10-28 17:21:50,Great app but...,"I love this app however it frustrates me that the current job title seems to be the only factor that is included when recruiters are delivered search results.  As a consultant, my title can be anything and it may be quite different from my functional role and area of expertise.  Depending upon the currently listed job title, I’ve noticed a sharp difference in the number contacts I receive from recruiters and the roles they are seeking.  I wish that other factors such as education, certifications and skills would be considered when recruiters are delivered search results.  Also, LinkedIn should allow subscribers to search by certification or certificate.  Currently a search for common certifications returns no results despite the fact that these certifications are listed within job descriptions.",4
2023-10-07 04:26:30,Scam,"They do not show you the jobs if you don’t pay them $34 per month. Which is expensive, because the same jobs are also on google too. 
They have scammers who impose as HR people, even doing fake interviews. If you report this to LinkedIn, they do not recognize it as a scam. 
I had an interview where I needed to perform a difficult 2 days test and an interview where the boss was racketeering me and harassing me. I also found more complaints about this particular company on google and Reddit but LinkedIn says, there is nothing wrong with them. Out of 200 applications, maybe 30 will download your file but only 11 will open your file. It means their platform is full of fake jobs. I have been applying for jobs straight to the companies and I know for sure they were not seeking for anyone but LinkedIn would post a job from those companies. Scam, a lot of scam. They just want your money. I was better off without them",1
2018-09-13 01:23:39,App crashes and crashes again.,"I downloaded the app again because I thought it would be easier to use on my phone. I’ve been using it for about 30 minutes and it has crashed 3 times. It crashed while I was sending a request to connect. I was attaching a message to this request because the person doesn’t know me. Now, It has sent the request and I can’t finish my message. I don’t know if it attached what I typed already or not. Given that LinkedIn is a tool to help people network and make professional connections, this is more than frustrating. Now, to reach out to this person, I would have to pay for a premium account and use “in mail.” I’ll not be using the app anymore which is a serious inconvenience. I stopped using the Linked In app years ago because it would lead to accidental connection requests while scrolling through searches or suggested connection.",2
2020-10-02 06:42:49,Hate speech from other LinkedIn members and employees,"Not a safe place to have a professional opinion in most professions. Especially if you are a women. LinkedIn does not respect women whom have professional scientific reasoning and professional opinions that vary from the political slant posted by either a member or otherwise linkedin; however LinkedIn will continue to push the political slant into your feed continually inviting you to acknowledge the political topic which is slanted and not academically or professionally sound. If you don’t like it and if you contribute your intelligent, professional and academically sound comment LinkedIn members state hate things to a person such as Members stating hate statement to me and others I have witnessed ). Very disappointed in the lack of professionalism from LinkedIn employees whom allow the members and themselves to be so hateful to women and others on LinkedIn whom state professional scientific academically sound verbiage on a topic.",1
2022-04-28 15:31:43,NOT for dedicated job seekers,"This platform is no longer useful for finding a job. The app does all of what it can to keep the user locked in to the feed section. If I’m reviewing a job and my screen lock becomes active (or view something off of the app), when I return to the app, I am immediately taken to my feed. When I go back to the job section, the job I was reviewing is no longer visible. I’m sure it’s not deleted. It’s just hard to tell which one I was viewing, especially if you’re searching for similar jobs. It’s like as soon as you put your phone down, you lose place in line. It creates nothing but wasted time.

For anyone who has experienced a layoff, unemployment is a lot of work and it can easily wear you out. The last thing a person needs is a tool that slows them down. Of course a person can look elsewhere for jobs but why even have a job section if it has basic flaws.",1
2021-04-13 22:47:28,Useful but opportunities for improvement,"LinkedIn is the prime social networking app for professionals. Main avenue for jobs and all that.

I think here’s some opportunities for improvement:

1. Make a filter for company size when looking for jobs. 

2. A lot of recruiters post contracts as “full-time” as a sneaky way to get more applicants since they consider a full time role 40 hrs/week. Make this differentiation even clearer by saying “Permanent Full-Time.” I don’t know how many contract roles I’ve seen saying it’s Full-Time and luckily I read every description pretty carefully.

3. Make an option for when Looking For Work is turned on, we can put more details for recruiters to see. I get hit up for temp/contracts all the time and have no interest in them. Recruiters don’t bother reading profiles.

4. It would be great to have an option to rate or leave feedback on recruiters when you are communicating with them. Just like you have automatic “Yes/Not interested” responses, there should be a way to leave feedback on recruiter accounts since so many recruiters are rude, ghost candidates, post things unrelated to your field/interests, solicit, etc.",4
2023-10-10 17:54:10,Paid experience is same as free experience,"I used a linked in free profile for a while and when I was on the job market decided to try premium. I had it for a few months past the free trial, used it multiple times a week, but soon realized I didn’t see any difference in the experience. No better prospects, never got any interest in my profile even though I opted to let recruiters see me. I even optimized my profile based on suggestions and no discernible difference in engagement or connections. Decided to cancel premium but then found out that I couldn’t go back to my free profile (perhaps even they know there is no difference!) I had to erase my whole profile just to stop paying for a service that offered no real service! It is annoying because now I can’t even use LinkedIn links (like when someone send me a job I might be interested in) without making a new free profile.",1
2017-12-20 16:50:28,iPhone X,"Number one, if your application in the Apple IDs door would support a dialog box when selecting apps support I would be writing this in that dialog box and not under reviews. My review is based on the fact that Face ID is not used by LinkedIn. LinkedIn‘s responses leave your app signed in. I do not wish to do that, the information in the app is too private for me to take LinkedIn suggestion. The technology for Face ID has been incorporated to I would say 70 percent of the applications at this point, so it tells me that updating your app to use this functionality cannot be that difficult. I’ll be waiting for the Face ID recognition in your app soon. I would use your out more by not having to manually put in my password, holding the phone to your face makes my motivation to use your application what greater than having to use my large fingers To type in my password. Thank you, John",2
2022-10-25 16:15:31,Messaging has become terrible and extremely frustrating,"The main thing I use LinkedIn for is messaging and the past couple of months with these updates the messaging has gone so downhill with more glitches and bugs than ever it makes me not even want to use it. Sometimes I click on a person to message and it just never pulls up the conversation or freezes when I am trying to hit send. Also, when you have a search going, it now disappears the moment you click out of the app to read a text or something which makes you have to keep putting in what you are searching for and it never used to do that.  This app used to be great before they ruined it with pointless updates that only made things worse with no noticeable improvements. I would have rated 5 stars before these updates if that tells you how frustrating this has become.",1
2023-08-23 01:18:02,Warning about LinkedIn Terrible,I had a LinkedIn account that I ran my photography business through messaging & sharing with customers sharing links they would send me and me to them. After at least five years of using the App LinkedIn stopped letting me log into my account asking for verification on KYC which I provided after about two months and the account still not able to login. I inquiring as to why the account was shutdown and not letting me login. LinkedIn finally has sent me an email saying that I have shared post or links they don’t want being forwarded. No warnings in five years of being loyal to the brand and they kicked me to the curve like I an ugly dog to them. It really hurt my business and feelings that this is as good as it gets in business today use at your own risk don’t put nothing on the platform you want to keep because I was locked out. I shared a few Crypto links?,1
2019-04-09 23:46:19,Responding to recruiters new feature is terrible,"In the past when I was contacted by a recruiter in my message inbox, I could respond directly to the recruiter. Now, the app forces you to respond whether or not you are interested in the job before you have a chance to respond. To me this is a 100% unnecessary feature and is an unprofessional way to contact a recruiter to express interest. The right way to treat a recruiter is to write that person directly and let them know your intentions, perhaps including some background for your decision. This can help keep communication channels open in the future and is a networking opportunity. This new feature is a result of someone “overthinking” the situation. This goes back to the old saying, “If its not broke, don't fix it”",4
2022-01-21 01:15:18,Horrible app/ Customer service,"The app/ website is difficult to use and the UI is as good as a brick. Windows 98 is easier to use. You can’t contact customer support via the phone, at all. If you can’t log in you can’t get to their email to contact them and when you finally hear back it’s “violated terms of service” and will not elaborate. IV read the TOS and there’s nothing I’m doing wrong. Can’t use the app/website on multiple devices or it will lose its ****. Relies on community mangers to help solve claims but it dosent help at all. I had to google a phone number and email to put in a support ticket while being locked out of my account. The phone goes to an automated voice that only tells you, to refer to their help tab that has useless information. LinkedIn needs competition because this is a huge pain to deal with. I strongly suggest you look for an alternative to LinkedIn.",1
2018-10-24 02:58:31,Professional Networking Tool,"LinkedIn is my preferred way to interact with business professionals. I do, however, wish that the site would allow a longer time to deactivate an account or allow one to restore their account within a year. I deactivated my account for a “spiritual hiatus” and attempted to set my account back up and was unable to retrieve it. I built a great network before and now it seems like I am not getting as many recommendations for people that I knew from college and other businesses. 😏 I’m sure my post sounds like a combination of great things and not so great things, but I do really appreciate the fact that the tool is much more professional than most social media outlets.",5
2023-10-13 14:14:39,I need more dots on my die!,"This is one super cool, fast paced, never boring but it does make you want shout! Absolutely one of the best games I’ve played online ever. This game wants you to advance extremely fast, quick and easy. But it also shows you how to manipulate, destroy and leave one of your friends broken, broke and mad because I chose to leave their building’s destroyed so they have to fix them. That costs more money, money is a big deal in this game. Everything costs money and breaking into your opponents bank and stealing their life’s savings is a bit evil, but I had fun doing it and it was worth the risk. The farther I put him back the further I can get a head.",5
2021-12-07 20:04:29,Love LinkedIn - hate this one tiny bug,"Please please please for all that is good and holy, please make it so when you connect with someone on the app, it pops up a “personalize invite” modal like it does on the desktop version. Or make the desktop version work like the mobile version (but the desktop flow is better IMO). The amount of times discrepancy between the two platforms has caused me to accidentally send an invite to early & blow a connection because I connect, want to personalize, and then can’t, and then need to withdraw and wait 3 (THREE!!) weeks before I can resend is just bonkers. Please please please fix this and I will come back and make this review 5 stars and love you forever. LinkedIn is a great platform, and could be a lot bigger than it is with people spending more time on it. They don’t because little stuff like this drives us wild.",2
2019-01-09 19:15:26,"Freezes, Can’t apply for jobs, links don’t work! NEEDS THE TO BE FIXED!","I’ve heard so many people speak highly of LinkedIn, so I tried it out. Unfortunately this app does NOT work, as it needs serious updates.  When you try to apply for any of the job listing your are given the option to give permission to attach your LinkedIn profile in replace or your resume, it does NOT work. Once you click you get a white screen or when it does go through to the next screen where it will ask for your name and contact info it freezes. Therefore you can not apply for any of their job listings. So I look up the company on google to find their website and then apply that way  with my own resume. 
The only thing LinkedIn is good for right now is to locate a job listing. Then apply on their site.  
I gave 1 star because at least they still proved job listing I can apply to on the companies web site directly.",1
2017-10-31 15:30:28,Horrible interface,"This is a perfect example of what NOT to do in mobile app design. 
1. Useless messenger button that does nothing but try and get you to download the app by popping not one, but two screens (if you don’t have it).  I won’t load Facebook Messenger because it won’t let me select no tracking without constantly being harassed. 
2. Extremely small “x” for closing annoying ad windows so that if you have any normal or larger than normal finger (god forbid you try and use your thumb) then you end up opening the item instead. 
3. Allowing you to block some advertisers for only 30-Days at a time??? Seriously. If it wasn’t bad enough that you show me adds from advertisers I’ve already blocked, now you’re unblocking them after 30 Days??
4. Extremely small “x” for closing annoying recommended groups windows so that if you have any normal or larger than normal finger (god forbid you try and use your thumb) then you end up opening the item instead. Can I just get you to stop recommending stuff to me? I’m not sure what algorithm you use but the recommendations are horrible. 
5. Translations are rarely ever correct. Give up here and just license Google’s translator. I’m not saying Google Translate is good, but it would at least be correct more than your translations are. 

There are more, I’m sure. But we will stop here.",1
2021-06-15 15:43:58,Great app. Unsubscribe from emails before Earth Dies.,"In all complete honesty, LinkedIn as a great app and it’s net work is good, but seriously, the amount of emails that you get from this company probably emits as much greenhouse gas as mining bitcoin. It’s in my opinion, one of the biggest email cloggers I have yet to experience. I have the rest of my life to see one that is worse, but challenge accepted, I guess.

I’ve been on this app since I was under 18 and I’m 27 now. I have spent many an hour clearing these LinkedIn emails, and it’s to the point where I fully understand that it could potentially be causing a detriment of heat to the earth due to the amount of emails they send out to literally anybody who is on planet earth and has an account. You will get carpal tunnel from swiping these emails into archive.",3
2023-06-06 19:40:47,"App is still terrible, customer service is worse","In the age of TikTok and Instgram, still bans and kicks you off for no reason, but spam accounts selling test prep are fine. Apparently if you are looking for jobs and networking and you’re using the app they will “ban” or “restrict” your account with no explanation except for “we’ve detected automated activity” I’m using the linkedin app on my iPhone! Why the developers don’t implement some features to deter actual automated activity such as: -Have users take a selfie, like Uber Driver app does -Remind users they have been scrolling for too long, like tiktok does -Tell users what the “threshold” for use is instead of having a “blackbox” and then issuing a ban. This is probably the worse customer experience/ user experience in an app ever! Should we use your app or not? Do we use your app and then get banned for no reason!? Linkedin Dev team please address this!!",1
2021-08-19 12:22:22,Very buggy app,"The app does its job in working the same as desktop. However, the notifications only work 1/10 times. In fact, most times you try to click an external link that will open the app, the app opens on an all black or all white screen and stays there. You have to force close the app to have it load normal again but if you were trying to see what the notification was about, I hope you have good memory. 

The app also does not hold your place in the feed so clicking anything for example a url will open their in-app window and returning will refresh your feed. Since LinkedIn is built on an algorithm to keep you interested in the app, you most likely won’t ever see that post again as it generates new items it thinks would be of interest. 

Lastly the other night I had spent 20 minutes writing a long message regarding business with another user. I was on my last sentence when the app suddenly crashed. If you’re wondering, no, the app did not draft my messages and I had to type everything back out again. 

Overall, it does its job but be prepared for a lot of bugs. And the notifications Never work.",3

I recently started trying to use the job alert feature. I searched for a job (“software engineer”) at a mid-sized clothing retailer. I have seen open roles there before, and I know they employ software developers, but they don’t happen to have any open roles right now. I would like to create an alert for when such a role does open up,  but the “turn on alerts for this search” toggle only appears for searches that currently produce results. Please add the toggle to all job searches, no matter how specific, since this is the point of these alerts—to let users know if/when a relevant job pops up. 

Also there’s no obvious “feedback” area in the app, so I had to come here. :(",4

I sent twice pictures of my identity and 2 weeks have gone by with no answer. I am still not able to access my account. What is going on. Again what was the reason to block it or denie access in the first place. It’s been more than 2 weeks now and for no good reason my account is still looked. I’m looking for job opportunities and clearly the corporate or software itself denies me the chance to do so. This is ridiculous. How can anyone try to expand or look for opportunities especially for military members trying to transition into civilian lifestyle. How am I suppose to do anything if this is the treatment Linkin is providing! And for no good reason my account was blocked! Why it doesn’t make any sense. It’s terrible service.,1

They have no quality assurance over job posts, so even if you set up an alert, it will give you a bunch of nonsense because job posters are allowed to mark jobs as more senior than they are and there is no way to apparently remove them. Contact their chat functionality which barely even works on the app so had to use the website and that was a whole performance, speaking to someone who just refused to answer questions and it would be better for them to use a bot at this point. Proof again that unregulated companies will behave as despicably as they’re allowed to. Guess we just have to wait for their next data breach.",1

I normally don’t search for people due to the profile viewing feature, but I would like to know why and how certain people are finding my profile.

2021-09-11 00:28:30,Job search,"Issues thus far: * sorting by latest took 2k results to 8 sole results * filtering by just today, lists 8 and says 230 available. * there’s a big blue bar asking me to save my search…I shouldn’t need to lose my UI space for something I’m not going to click very often. * I should be able to filter out contract work and recruiters. * I shouldn’t need to scroll through 100 postings by the same poster for the same job across regions.

Why do I have to scroll through 8 “promoted” postings for every one or two real ones…when I am sorted by newest? Why should I keep paying for this when I am treated like a dumb product that shouldn’t be allowed to sort but is expected to land a nice tech job pushing out more advanced features than that?",3
2023-04-30 02:49:33,Their monetization strategy is just to help people spam,"Their premium plans mostly offer users the ability to deliver unsolicited, unhelpful, and non-personalized (besides changing your name and work title/company name from the person they previously spammed) ads to promote useless services and or send mass market recruiting spam. There’s very little user controls in settings to filter this spam, and you basically only have to option of block ~all people including potentially genuine people from contacting you in order to keep your sanity. The lack of respect for user experience and monetization of spam is atypical for a Microsoft product. Unfortunately most of my friends and former colleagues have gone dormant. There are still some connections and creators whom I respect who do still post, but my experience even as a paid non-spamming user for years is steadily going down hill.",1

The new LinkedIn app will not run on the latest OS I can use (12.5.x), but the stupid app doesn’t comprehend that and keeps pestering me to update (at which point it fails, because I don’t have iOS 13+). Listen, we understand you don’t want to support the old app “forever “, but at the moment, the app itself works fine—it’s the neverend nag messages that are the problem. If you can’t tell someone is at that latest iOS they can get, let them manually disable the nags and keep using the app for as long as it works. Anyone, it became so annoying, I don’t use it nearly as much  as stopped paying the monthly premium charge.  Good work.",2
2020-01-29 01:04:17,A suggestion to the development team,"Dear Team,
The app has been developed nicely and is very user friendly. Everything’s great. There’s one feature that would really help out,
I am usually/mostly at work and have less time to watch videos, if there was a feature where I could save it to view later that would be amazing, I could just save the video/video link and go home and watch it instead of scrolling down and search for that post. Just like facebook app has the option to save the videos/video link to a certain ‘watch later’ folder. 
I really expect the team to work on it. 
Other than that, it’s good. Kudos to the developers!",5
2019-03-08 22:38:31,Good app but bad recent changes,"LinkedIn is a great professional app and I love how I can work on my career and look for opportunities using it! Haven’t had any weird glitches with it yet that downgraded my experience. 

I do have to deduct some points though for recent changes. The messages button was moved to the upper right and in its place on the bottom middle of the screen is the add a post button. This seems like a worse UI experience because I know I check and respond to messages far more than I post up a message and it’s kinda awkward to move the messages button up there. I also find that I can’t swipe to the right to go back to the last page I was on. Instead, I usually have to tap the back arrow in the upper left, which again, could be improved.",3
2023-04-08 21:23:52,Not very useful,"New to the platform but I have to say it is not very useful at all. I attempted to use the platform to search for local people looking for jobs similar to what I have to offer. After locating tons of accounts through the search bar, claiming they are looking for work, I realized that I can’t even visit their page, let alone open a line of communication to see if they would be interested in an interview. 

I understand that some would choose to keep their account private even while they are searching for jobs, but it wasn’t possible to view a single profile I came across through the search bar. I did find countless people looking for careers similar to what I am offering though. It’s like dangling food in front of a starving man. Am I supposed to pay the $60 per month to be able to “connect” with these people?",1
2020-06-22 18:48:24,Scammers,I was new to LinkedIn searching for new leads to jobs as I desperately need to find a new job after 27 years that gave my all. The hospital was bought out by Lahey Health and BI. Long story short I ended up being followed by what I know would turn out to be scams eventually asking for money I’m sure. I deleted one guy cause he made me feel uncomfortable. Then out of the blue 2 more people trying to chat with me. My final straw was when a third person tried to friend me or have conversation. But his profile picture was the person who first chatted with me. Different background picture but it was his face. Freaked me out so I don’t follow LinkedIn like I used to. I just recently had my identity stolen and I’m not going to entertain Catfish type people,4
2023-09-12 01:34:19,Changes Need To Be Made,"This review is more about the website than the app but they are directly related. 

Only being able to add 50 skills is kinda dumb, there are those of us who have been working professionally for many years and over that time have learned and honed more skills than can be added. Adding just those too skills does a disservice to the individual, especially when applying for a new job. How are you supposed to get a proper match with the system if you’re only showing two particular skills because you weren’t able to add more due to only being able to list your top skills? 

Just my two cents but this can’t be the first time this question or request has come up.",3
2023-07-01 11:59:27,"Glitches Everywhere, All the Time","I cannot stand using the mobile app for LinkedIn. I downloaded it YESTERDAY, and it has done nothing but glitch and crash since I got it. I’m constantly given push notifications, even though I turned every push notification off in the settings, and then when I open the app and go to notifications, I’m met with “no new notifications” and “no new messages” every single time. I took a screen recording, and in a time span of 1 minute and 10 seconds, I was given four notifications that were just glitches. 
It’s also not user friendly at all. It freezes and crashes every time I attempt to look in the job section. 

Feels like an app that was just created by someone who doesn’t know what they’re doing, and like it needs a serious upgrade by an actual professional.",1
2021-05-18 21:14:32,"Overall it is a great experience, however…","Great overall app and stays pretty true to its platform. There are 2 main things that bug me: 1) No dark mode and 2) messages don’t work properly. The messages is not great and you have to jump through hoops when you click on the notification for the message. You still have to go in the app and click on the messages icon and look for the message. Doesn’t have to be that complicated. Just give a notification click on the notification and let me go straight to the message. Also, should be able to respond to the messages from the Lock Screen.

Fix those 2 things and I will update my review and will add a star for each of those.",3

I have been using indeed, LinkedIn and zip recruiter to find full time jobs while applying to them. Unfortunately the LinkedIn app is having some problems which make it frustrating to narrow down jobs. Your search job section only allows you to pick certain things while something disappears. I can put full time in location while selecting distance, salary and date posted. However it can let’s you select one or two of the options but not all three. I think it would be wise to fix the app to allow people to find what they are searching for and it could make the process smoother on people",2

I use LinkedIn for job searching and on its face LinkedIn seems good for that. Except since I started using it heavily for this purpose I’m inundated with scams. People emailing me for telegram interviews, phone calls from numbers don’t know, who don’t leave messages have ratcheted up. Fake LinkedIn profiles of people and companies pretending to be real people or companies to phish our personal info. It’s a HUGE problem and has been a large time waster for me. If this could be better managed by the company somehow it would be a much more useful platform and so 3 stars it is for now.",3
2023-10-20 14:01:37,There a scam,This app is a scam and they deleted my account for no reason. It was my way of staying connected with my co workers as well as people working in the field who ive met along the way. Building relationships to better career in the future was destroyed by this corrupt system. They are so horrible and now they are requesting my very sensitive and personal identification when they're system has been hacked recently and all personal information was leaked. Now they are requesting this information again as if i did something wrong when in fact it’s their scam system and fraudulent people working here who are attempting to steal your personal information and share data with whoever pays them on the side. These people are beyond scammers. Do not use LinkedIn they will do anything to obtain your personal information so they can sell it. Good riddance,1
2018-05-11 23:24:06,Watch out for Premium Trial!!,"The mobile version lacks so many of the desktop version features such as privacy features and profile customization. However, what really bothers me is that LinkedIn uses this difference to their financial advantage so you cannot cancel a Premium subscription from your device even if they allow you to subscribe from your phone easily. You also get no notification when the Premium trial is ending so you get charged abruptly. If you miss the subscription cancellation date, LinkedIn will offer no refunds even if late by an hour!! Really?

Update:
The LinkedIn team reached out to me as shown below to offer support. Alas, it was all just lip service. When I reached out, they simply confirmed the limitations I had originally complained about without any real assistance offered.",2
2022-09-14 00:49:13,Really useful,"Honestly, I was finding myself super annoyed at the notifications lately. Every time I check the app, it seems like 5 minutes later I have a notification, and it’s just recommended content. Before writing a negative review I did check my settings and was happy to find it easy to tune my notifications so they are just for actual conversations and important updates. Thanks for making that easy. Otherwise no complaints, the app works well and I like certain features a lot (like quickly saving jobs on mobile so I can login on desktop later to review again and apply).",4

How many people wish they were. facebook advertising ninja?  Well, linkedin is different, dynamic, and changing on a weekly basis.

2020-07-22 15:21:39,Doesn’t show Jobs you’ve Applied for!,"Don’t plan on an easy time keeping track of the jobs you’ve applied for. I had applied for at least a dozen jobs. A couple days later I went to look for more jobs and check on the jobs I had already applied to. But under the “Jobs Applied” tab, there were ZERO jobs listed. Oh and I’m pretty sure I looked like an idiot when I accidentally applied for the same job twice since LinkedIn doesn’t tell you if you applied for the job yet or not.

I emailed customer service and they took a week to get back to me. Here is the response:
“Please note that only when you apply for Easy apply jobs. If you are applying Jobs on the external website, it will not show up in the applied Jobs section.

Aishwarya
Member Success Consultant”

DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND USE INDEED! That app/site keeps track of EVERY job you’ve applied to and if you happen upon the same job listing later on it TELLS YOU that you’ve already applied to that one. Indeed is so helpful and much better organized. And you don’t have to see the “newsfeed” from other people posting about their own job. I’m sorry, but why would I care if a guy from high school who never talked to me is posting about his career that has nothing to do with mine?!",1

I have received dozens of phone calls in the past 2 months from online vendors all of them telling me the same thing. They PURCHASED my personal data from LinkedIn and use that to call me and others. 

LinkedIn is not protecting my data but actively selling it. 

Your terms and conditions clearly state that “IF SOMEONE ALREADY HAS YOUR NUMBER then they can find you.” Well now that you are selling my number how does this work? LinkedIn has betrayed my trust. 

Now I’m backed into a corner, what if I want to protect my data, I may want to use my phone number to reset a password. If I do that then I also concede that I knowingly allow LinkedIn to sell my data. Am I supposed to just allow this to happen? 

I’m posting here because for the past hour I could not find your customer service email channel. 

I’m curious if apple would see this as an invasion of privacy or just a cost of doing business. It bothers me greatly that you feel justified in selling my personal data and not sharing that you have done so. 

You should fix this.",2
2023-09-12 21:54:58,Notification Settings,"This app (like their website) makes changing notification settings really annoying. I am currently employed and don’t want any emails from LinkedIn, but don’t mind getting in app notifications. To set this, you have to go to each notification type (like 50) and switch off email and or push notifications. Now if I’m going to look for a new job, I’ll want to receive some emails and will have to make numerous adjustments again. Since LinkedIn has cornered the job seeking market, they get away with flooding everyone’s inbox with irrelevant marketing emails until you spend 10 minutes adjusting your settings (and possibly 5 more writing a 3 star review.)",3

Gotta keep people addicted and collect data point for people touching the app!!! 🤬 I TRIED.. I tried for 2 weeks to avoid turning off notifications, just tweaking settings each time I was annoyed, but I’ve lost it. Turning them off didn’t feel active enough for how mad I was, I wanted someone at the company to hopefully hear this.

Often times I get the never ending spinner, with an ultimate failure error message.

The search function is not functional as it will return irrelevant search results. I’m aware I can make alerts but even the results in the alerts are off base. The app and site should allow more tailored filtering that actually STICKS and take all the extra bells and whistles off the app so it will work more smoothly. I don’t go to linked in to read the freakin news - I go to look for jobs and/or network. I think both the app and the site would be a lot better and easier to use if they’d just stick with that.,3
2017-10-14 19:05:14,Linkedin App is a must have for anyone in business at any level,When Linkedin first introduced an app I’ll admit I was sceptical. I was leery because I’ve experienced many many websites attempting to make life easier with a new app and they fall on their face. This particular app is probably one of the easiest to maneuver and it allows me to stay connected easily with notifications and simple maneuvering around the site. I choose to be a Premier member and the benefits are well worth the money. I love linked in. I’ve become friends worldwide not only for the industry I’m in but also personal friends with multitudes or different interests. Get the app.,5
2018-09-27 02:56:28,Frustrated! Tired of app crashing constantly.,"This app constantly crashes on uploading posts with photos and video. The effort that it takes to write a post goes to waste as it crashes more than 90% of the time. I am using iPhone X, so hardware should not be an excuse for this issue. I would like to hear what the developers have to say about the problem. This problem has been an issue for at least last 2 years. I have installed the app multiple time but no luck. I don’t use the app anymore but sometime while traveling I have no other option. I am not sure why such a basic functionality is not resolved on this platform. Is it too hard for LinkedIn to figure this out??

2017-12-02 07:34:16,BEWARE - Terrible customer service and awful refund policy.,"I was tricked into paying $135(!!!) for a “premium” subscription that has absolutely no value to me. I assumed that the free trial would end because I never received a single email or notification about the upcoming subscription renewal after signing up for a free trial last month. I tried to find a place to cancel the subscription in the app and on the website with no luck. Now LinkedIn refuses to refund the payment. I am appalled. For a company that feigns interest in professional success, they have absolutely no sense of what providing good customer service entails. Auto renewing an expensive subscription without notice and without asking for permission is sneaky and conniving. Then refusing to refund the payment is insane. I am severely disappointed in LinkedIn and will be sure to warn my employees, colleagues, and friends.",1

Every time I leave the app to text, check a calendar, read an email, I return to LinkedIn and it resets to the top of the feed instead of resuming where I’ve left off. So I’m left with scrolling all the way back to where I was or forgetting it and switching to something else entirely because it’s frustrating, and it’s usually the latter. IG and FB can handle remembering where I was when I switch so I know you can do this. I’m not even closing the app entirely. It’s still open in the background. This change would increase my engagement with this tool. Please help.",4
2023-10-13 23:15:08,Frustrating,"Hadn’t used the app in a while.  Was pleasantly surprised when it opened right up and worked nicely.  Then I left the app and came back to it later in the day.
When I came back, it had a popup pushing me to update.  It wouldn’t let me ignore it.  So I let it take me to app store.  But I can’t get the update because I still have an older iOS.  It refused to install an older version that would be compatible with my ios.
So now I’m stuck.  I can’t update it right now, and I can’t keep using it as-is, because the little popup forcing me to update won’t go away or let me do anything in the app.
Frustrating when I know it worked great this morning without being updated 😤.  And the app store says the last update was 3 days ago, so I know it didn’t just update today without asking me.",1

Also, I get way too many notifications and my attempts to dial them back haven’t been 100% successful. I even had to turn off the badge count in the settings app. Although there’s a weird bug that still displays the badge number at the folder level (if the app is in a folder), even after deleting and reinstalling the app. Restarting my iPad fixed it temporarily.",3

Almost twice a week I have to clear the cache, remove app data, remove search data, and most of the time erase and reinstall the app to access the app in order to see messages from potential clients or recruiters. 

The app consistently will say “could not refresh page,” No matter the connectivity to 5G or tested, known-good wifi. 

I am grateful for the access it provides and will acknowledge there’s no better professional social media for job hunters, but as the best software it should have the best engineers working to resolve these bugs, and there should be an easier way to report issues up the engineering pipeline as a longterm user.",1

2023-02-21 19:32:23,Good reviews why?,I don’t under the appeal of this app. I have a recruiter friend that kept recommending it to me. Not once in all the years I’ve used it has any job offer ever come through. Even with her help updating my resume. Also the search job function is useless. For example I can type “executive assistant” “remote” and it will bring up jobs not even relating to what I asked for. It takes part of one of two words and tries to match it I guess?? Why when I type executive assistant it shows me a sales manager position? It also doesn’t save my settings. I want to see the most recent jobs but it keeps defaulting to “most relevant”. I shouldn’t have to keep changing my settings. Just have never had a good experience with this app. Very frustrating to use with no leads ever. Don’t recommend,1

Try to write an article on the app...crash! Try to apply to a job...almost always crashes! Try to download or save something from the app....I can guarantee it will crash!

Is it necessary for me to take this free data AI collection test for Microsoft/LinkedIn over and over again every time I get my password wrong. Is there a reason why this is the only app that won’t accept my facial recognition, while every other app does, when moving from Mac to my iPhone to log in???

Sometimes I want to type a message to someone or update my profile, only to find out later that the message was lost or the updates were not made. It’s happening on both my iPhone and iPad. I’ve contacted the support team several times, each time they seem to fix the problem but only for a few days. It keeps coming back! I’m even a premium member but that doesn’t seem to make any difference, it’s just so frustrating. I’m starting to use other means like Glassdoor more and more... Conclusion: the app can be great but for me it’s totally unreliable, I just can’t recommend it for anyone who needs to seriously work with it.",1
2017-09-23 16:45:39,Please Fix,I am trying to connect to a lot of fitness professionals and it takes 10+ minutes for the requests to send after I clicked on it.  Then if I switch screens it stops sending them.  So I have to resend requests over and over.   It also covers up the search bar so I can’t do anything else.  Then when clicking the little circles to add someone it always will jump to their page because my fingers are too fat maybe making it less sensitive around the circle or making it a bigger button would be better.  It just is a nuisance and I can’t get back because the back button is covered up by the requests being sent pop up. Fix those problems and I’d say 5 star.,3
2020-09-26 06:50:44,Just another Facebook or Instagram now,"Just opened Facebook, I mean Instagram, oh no I mean LinkedIn. The latest update has remodeled the user interface to make it appear more like Facebook or Instagram. I have always loved the professionalism of LinkedIn and the feature that made it less like a social network. I’m not here for peoples live videos but more for professional opinions, relationships, and experiences.

I am a multiple-times-a-day user, frequently browsing my industry network and making new and valuable connections. That won’t be as easy anymore with the latest move by LinkedIn to conform to the likes of Facebook and LinkedIn. 

Would love to learn more about the intelligence and user surveys that led to this latest change because they were obviously flawed.",2
2021-02-26 04:01:10,Login/Authentication issue,"As mentioned by many other users, the app keeps asking me to re-login every time I closed the app. Something worse happened a few months ago. Although I can still use the app, it creates so much in convenience. And I can’t believe this fundamental issue is not being fixed for many days and is repeating not far from the last incident.
Plus, I have problems using the app, too. Sometimes the connection is just broken when I’m trying to refresh, click a page, like a post, etc., the page return error(page not found or something similar). Ugh.
I love the LinkedIn platform, but the app really needs to be more solid. 
Please test your product before each release and take feedback seriously and avoid similar issue happen in the future. Thanks!",1
2022-10-08 07:19:32,Replacing the My Network tab?,"What an awful update this is.  The new discover tab is a rehash of the home tab.  I have absolutely no use for it.  My most visited tab was “my network” and now it’s an absolute pain to get to and poor user experience.  I am sure some clever product manager thinks this is some great new innovation that the users didn’t know we needed. But it’s not. It’s just making the experience worse.  Even when using the resource section link to my network, it’s still a bad look and feel compared to the old layout.  You have enough bugs to keep your team busy. How about you focus on not constantly refreshing back to the home page when you click off the app?  This update is a failure.  Stop making changes for change’s sake.",1
2023-02-05 04:10:04,No flag to indicate “Not Looking “!,"I have been retired for about 1.5 years, and like to stay on LinkedIn to see what is going on with people I used to work with. My heading is written as “Retired”, but I keep getting contacted by head hunters! I am not interested in going back to work and it would be nice if LinkedIn had flag to indicate “Not Looking” or something to that effect! I am flattered that some people see my skills as a possible asset, but feel that if they could see right away that I prefer not work, they would not waste their time and get their hopes up. I am quite certain that I am not the only person on LinkedIn that would use such a flag. Thanks",3
2021-06-20 04:47:56,Forced indoctrination,"Linkedin forces all users to participate in policies supported by their company that users do not agree with and that have nothing to do with professional health nor professional interest or connections or network for which all users come onto linked in for. They also mark all complaints as resolved and closed by force that has been brought to their support attention when it ""has not"" been resolved to the users satisfaction snd they have been made aware of it, they ignore this fact. This is not an ideal platform to use because of this. Seek other professional platforms that allow users to opt out of anything they disagree with and to participate in anything they agree with without Linkedin forcing their indoctrination policies on users.",1
2020-09-01 14:49:58,A great app/website for shameless self-promoters,I started my account 6 years ago in hopes it would help me land a new job. I found a new job but no thanks to LinkedIn (another web based job site helped with that). The content consists mostly of posts from people shamelessly promoting themselves or from people trying to spin their videos of children or animals into some kind of life altering message. Now the geniuses (at LinkedIn) are taking it upon themselves to change my chosen location on my profile unless I tell them not to.  That’s seriously messed up. How about suggesting I change it?  What’s really disturbing is that my phone does not show any location services that can be switched off on the app. Honestly thinking about deleting.,2
2019-12-18 19:00:54,Cannot message potentials connects before accepting,"The evil money-grabbers at LinkedIn have removed the ability to message for free somebody who has requested to join your network. For privacy and security it is necessary that we be able to message these people to make sure they are who they say they are or if we don’t recognize them, to ask them where we know them from. As a free user I am now forced to accept the connection before sending the message, exposing my personal info to a potential stranger. The goblins as LinkedIn need to value our privacy and security over our money by reenabling the reply (don’t accept yet) option on connection requests. If you agree, please also give a one star review (you can even copy and paste mine) so we can inform LinkedIn that they cannot get away with this.",1
2018-10-15 12:52:07,Stop with the excessive notifications,"Update: I can’t send the screenshots to you with the glitch through this app. I’ve emailed you through the actual desktop site with this problem, asking for an email address to show you this issue. Nothing has changed and no one has contacted me. App will be deleted. 

I turned off all notifications because I was getting too many. I was tired of it. Now, I get a notification that I have no notifications set up. That’s. The. Point. Stop with this ridiculous amount of notifications. Fix it, otherwise, I’m deleting the app altogether.

Update again: Since I just got another response from LinkedIn about this problem, here’s the update: I can’t send you a screenshot, see point above. The app has been deleted off my phone for months now.",1
2017-10-03 18:51:11,Completely irresponsible with push notifications,"I've turned off notifications for everything except the few things I care about (invitations to connect, messages, anything else that pertains directly to me). I still receive push notifications for superfluous events like ""trending news articles"" on a daily basis. The app is designed to have as many notification types as possible, and I've turned off more obscure notifications than I can remember. If you turn one off, the notification settings linked from the dismissed message only shows you what you've turned off, with no option to turn off all the other notifications you'll eventually receive. Completely irresponsible and annoying. I'll be reserving LinkedIn for the desktop from now on.",1
2017-11-20 03:46:12,Quit messing with the app!,"And STOP asking me to link my contacts—never going to happen in a million years!

I give up... What happened to the swipe feature to ignore/delete people whom I don’t want to send an invite to?? 

UPDATE: The response from LinkedIn makes absolutely no sense! I’m not asking for some new “improvement”—I want them to return to the logical functionality the app used to have. Do they honestly expect people to keep scrolling through this exhaustive list of names of others they don’t want to connect with, without a deletion method???

UPDATE 2: The latest response from LinkedIn still makes no sense! Again, this is not some kind of “new improvement” I’m requesting. It’s the way the app USED to work and NOW the functionality is GONE. PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!!!

UPDATE 3: Thank you for bringing back the feature of being able to “x” the people I don’t want to connect with. But, the new huge box layout is awful because you see less people on the screen at once and can’t read as much about them without clicking on their profile. Just put it back to the way it used to be please!!",2
2023-01-30 14:36:57,Important post vanished and no support,"I’m so frustrated with linkedin. I’ve been on that platform for what feels like forever and as of recently they have totally ignored my support messages. One of the most important posts of my career simply vanished due to their internal technical error (drafts are connected to published posts, so if you have a second window open with a draft of the post you published, and you delete the draft days or weeks later, your published post will vanish too!!!). No help whatsoever, they simply say they will forward the case to the technical team or research team but nothing ever happens and they simply close the case. It’s become the worst platform, this is just one example of how they leave you hanging, and do not offer support whatsoever.",1
2023-04-23 23:40:35,Some complains,"In general it’s ok. Two things I don’t like:

The same ad show up on my feed everyday. I finally want to turn it off. I cannot find an easy way to turn it off. I’m still going to see it everyday. I’m going to be so sick of it and stop using LinkedIn.

When you are pushed with a job opportunity, sometimes your connections will show up below the job brief description line. I would assume those head icons are super links to those users’ pages. But they are not. You hit on them, you still connect to the job page instead.",4
2021-06-12 04:58:11,Didn’t even get to sign in,"I’m a thirteen year old going into highschool in only a couple of months. I plan on graduating early, so I’ve been trying to figure out what career to pursue. I was told that LinkedIn was a good app to research about careers. So I thought why not? When creating an account, I added my date of birth as “2007” and I was booted out saying that I did not meet the age requirements although their age requirements are stated as 12+. I thought, maybe I typed in the wrong date of birth? So I tried to create an account again. It told me “your phone number is already in use.” So I went to log in; there was no account created using my number. Anyways, I tried again. This time with my email. I didn’t even get passed my name. It kept saying “registration in process.”",1
2021-03-23 14:10:16,Horrible app,"Half the time I get told there is no internet connection found, yet switching to mobile version I get no such error (nor have any issue getting to any other app or thing online)  Nice try to blame app issues on a network. There are so many problems with the app + search / most recent / job alert search result issues that it’s not even worth the download. Problem is most of these issues exist on the mobile (browser) version as well so using anything other than the desktop version is a lackluster experience. 

Not impressed given the maturity of the company. Seems like user experience and QA testing before releases isn’t really their thing anymore. This is what happens when chasing the Benjamins is the focus even though it’s the users/consumers who made the company.",1
2019-10-30 20:05:01,Could be better,"First and most importantly, there should be a rate/review a company option! This would allow current, past & possible new candidates transparent reviews about every company! A competitor, Glassdoor has this feature! Past associates would be able to shine light on issues they encountered while working there as well. Secondly, what’s with the constant LinkedIn members flooding message inbox to get one to go premium? I would like a notification feature where I can more easily tell when I have new messages that way I can keep track and respond in a more timely fashion! Many messages from employers are lost in the shuffle of my LinkedIn messages overall.",3
2019-05-04 00:10:36,Beware of the “free” premium auto renewal..,"Before I start.. this is more a review for Apple/iTunes subscription practices than LinkedIn.. so everywhere you see LinkedIn, you can basically fill-in any auto renewal subscription app.. WATCH OUT!! If you’re interested in trying out the free Premium version, you better be paying attention because if you’re not, you're going to slapped with the $65 monthly subscription charge before you even figure out what the difference is between Premium and the free version! I can think of a TON of other things I’d rather spend $65 on! And if you do get charged, GOOD LUCK getting Apple/iTunes to issue you a refund... I think they literally flip a coin. You’re likely stuck with another 30 days. Maybe you can use the extra 30 days figure out the difference..SOUR APPLE!",1
2022-11-02 02:05:38,Terrible app for a great platform,"The mobile app is total garbage. That’s how much money has been put into LinkedIn you would think a little bit would be spent on making the app work better. I don’t understand why it needs to refresh the whole app when I go to another page or another app causing me to lose comments or messages. The app crashes frequently when I’m using it and I have the newest iPhone and the latest update. The messages are a complete nightmare to try to use and respond to people. Everything seems to take much longer to load than it should and there are so many issues I don’t even know where to start. 

Please focus on making this app work better. The number of bugs are ridiculous.",1
2022-08-29 14:57:17,So glitchy,"Messages that have been archived still show up on the mobile app. On my desktop it’s ok but the mobile is so freaking glitchy. I can’t get the messages not show up in my inbox even though they have been archived. I don’t get notifications when someone posts a comment. It’s only when I go to the post that I can see who commented or liked it. Comments on posts don’t load. It says “see more replies/comments” but then nothing expands and it still shows that there are replies. When writing a post the cursor keeps jumping to the bottom of the page. That’s a new glitch. Hate the mobile app. And using mobile web browser is worse. LinkedIn, get yourself together!",2
2020-06-02 23:42:28,LinkedIn and Microsoft are not interested in your feedback,"I spent 20 minutes looking for a way to provide app feedback on the app and on the website to no avail. Regardless, this is the actual feedback - I have been missing messages since I turned off badges. When I turned badges on to address this, I was inundated with LinkedIn's notification happy feed. I would like to see these things when I log in, but not interested in them being included in the badge alert count. My only option was to turn off badges and revert to email notifications for new messages. It seems like a missed opportunity, and even more so if they make it impossible for those interested in improving the platform to provide feedback.",2
2021-05-14 17:00:49,"Love the platform, app notifications are a problem","As a social networking site, LinkedIn is amazing. The iPhone app is pretty intuitive as well, which is great. Unfortunately, with the latest release, they added notifications about online events to the My Network page, and there is no way to disable these notifications. In the past, notifications on the My Network page were for connection requests, which made good logical sense. The only way to avoid constantly having a notification displayed on the app badge is to completely disable badge icons, which means you may miss important things.",3
2020-04-24 14:18:17,LinkedIn is a very dangerous product,"LInkedIn is a dangerous product. Users beware. I recently discovered that without any authorization from me or from anyone with access to my Apple devices, they have been charging me almost $100 per month for something called Premium Business. I was able to submit a request for refund but for only the past two months via Apple support. But Apple advise that only two months can be refunded even though LInkedIn apparently began charging me monthly in December 2019. The LinkedIn website gives no means for canceling or requesting refund for charges that are apparently fraudulent - due to some LinkedIn mistake.

Apparently the Premium Business account is for corporations, not for retired individuals with very limited income and no need for any LinkedIn Premium Services.",1
2023-08-02 18:21:40,Fix the web page,"Normally, the web page does all I need the few times that I use it. Yesterday, I tried updating my profile, but many of the changes didn’t seem to stick. I tried searching help, but the help links prompt iOS Safari to download the web page rather than show it. Searching the web indicates LinkedIn has shut down all means of contacting them, so I guess 1-star review is where it’s at.

I downloaded the app to update the profile, which worked. But then it asked me permission to send me notifications. Clicking “don’t allow” did nothing and couldn’t dismiss the prompt. I quit the LinkedIn app and it didn’t go away. I tried “allow” and it didn’t go away. I couldn’t use the iPad at all, so I had to reboot it.",1
2019-04-09 13:36:17,Poor customer service,"So this is the third review I am writing, my first two were taken down.  

Again my issue is a simple one. 

1. Make the “X” to click off a potential contact a bit larger so I am not opening one instead of deleting it. 

2. If I delete someone don’t put them back in the suggested contacts over and over and over and over. They should not ever appear again. 

Two simple fixes to two problems with linked in. 

Additional problem that was not in my first two reviews: 

3. Don’t delete my review because you don’t like it.

3/9/19 Update:
Keeps getting worse. Nothing has been fixed and the little “x” seems harder to click. I don’t want to click on the “x” just to have it open someone’s profile. It is a false click. I am sure that is why I get so many “people are looking at your profile” notifications each week, the tiny “x”

I will add another problem:
4. Half the time now I cannot open a profile I actually want to see. The program freezes and I need to close and reopen the app, then I need to TRY to find that persons again. 

Please, I implore you, please fix these small, but glaring, problems",1
2019-04-03 13:26:18,Mobile is inferior to desktop version,"I find LinkenIn a valuable way to connect professionally. I like the convenience of being able to access my account on my laptop or through the app. The mobile app has issues though, primarily that the news feed can not be displayed chronologically with “most recent” instead of the algorithm-determined “top stories”. The value of this network is seeing what people are doing now and what events are coming up. Eliminating the ability to view the feed by recent posts makes the mobile app useless for me. 

Please change the app to display the feed is chronological order. This is not Facebook.",3
2018-08-18 14:36:20,Only One Problem,"I gave LinkedIn’s latest mobile app 5 Stars because “in general” I believe it deserves it. 
However, although it might be only happening on my iPhone 6sPlus, I have the following bug: When I first open the app, (Main Screen), the animated icon that used to appear at the top of the screen informing that there are New Posts is gone. If it’s not just my phone then it should be an easy fix. When it’s back then the 5 Stars will be fully deserved. Other than that, after 10 years, LinkedIn remains my Primary Social Media site.",5
2017-10-30 03:48:59,Hate the new suggestion function,"I got lots of people connect to me. I used to be able to accept most of hem quickly and now it kept pop up suggestions. Is annoying and interpreting the task I was trying to complete. Hate it. Please remove it! 

Also, you should have a function to allow people to make note to the connection and also auto record when I connect. eg I go to conference today so everyone I added today is from the conference. The pain point is that you don't remember where and how you met the person. Or when you go to conference, you add tons of people, when you are home and trying to recall who you met today, you open your LinkedIn, there is no easy way to find them anymore!",2
2022-10-21 17:22:54,LinkedIn Refreshes After Looking at other Apps,"LinkedIn is a fantastic tool for connecting with colleagues and networking across my field. However, the iPhone and iPad application is terrible. 

My #1 complaint is that the app refreshes just about every time I leave and look at another app on my device. Open the app and look to message a contact, switch to email to copy something to send to them, and when I go back to the app it’s completely refreshed and lost where I had been. It’s extremely frustrating.

#2, the app should give you the option to send a note with a connection request just like the website does. It’s annoying when it just shoots off an invite without giving the opportunity to enter a note.",1

But as I said in the title, the app NEEDS DARK MODE. My eyes can’t handle it anymore and I really hoping the Devs would have put it in by now since most if not all other apps have an option to switch on dark mode. This app needs that ASAP.",5

I’m looking for that option now though and can’t find it. Basically, I open up this app, and I feel like I see the same posts every single time. And I see that my timeline is showing me things from 1-2 weeks ago that I’m seeing for the umpteenth time. I really only want to see these things once. It feels like I never get an influx of new content, it’s always the same stuff. Sometimes there’s a newer post mixed in, but the overall sense I’m getting is that I’m not ever seeing anything new. It’s so annoying.",3

You can download your connections and get all the information you need to plan regional meetings except City and State. If you check profiles to get that information and add it to the downloaded spreadsheet, they restrict your account for the “security of your connections.” I can download their names, employer names, employment history, education history, etc., so I’m not sure how city and state contributes to security risk. Customer service rep didn’t seem to know city and state aren’t in the download, didn’t seem to care, and didn’t have the forethought to give that suggestion to the product development team. Kinda lame for a business app.",2

There’s no other app with a feed that does this, especially given its similarity to most social apps in terms of recommended posts, but it continues to annoy me because of the fact that if I receive a message and swipe away to respond, I’ll return to the app without being able to pick up where I left off and see what I was reading or what I had just scrolled by. 

Also pretty annoying how the algorithm really only displays a few (5-10) organizations’/people’s posts from the hundreds (200+) I follow.",1

As an example, the app interface is aging, slow, and uninspiring. “Posts” are becoming advertising in disguise and no-content click bait posts are now the majority of the content.  For MSFTs us$26.2 Billion purchase, you might expect more. 
Hopefully, a competitive site will gain popularity soon. I can’t see value with “premium” membership if you aren’t a in sales or a recruiter except, ironically, if you really hate your job or really extroverted and unemployed. In the “column” the basic feature of connecting to others is ok for now (but Twitter is getting better for most things). Free LinkedIn is ok - paid LinkedIn is questionable",2

LinkedIn checks all the boxes for me except that it’s starting to get glitchy at times. I lose connections one minute and they reappear the next hour or so on my contact list. I’ve deleted the app a few times and reinstalled it; it has helped solved the problem momentarily.

I actually really like this app but the latest update has completely crashed the platform.
My profile and feed will not load at all. If I didn’t know better, I’d think that the latest update has erased my profile entirely. But having visited the desktop platform, I can tell that all of my info is safe.

UPDATE 1:50pm :
I can now login. And congrats on adding a much needed native video feature. But now the issues is that posts aren’t functioning as intended.
It appears that you attempted to add a carousel feature for multiple image posts (which is great) but it doesn’t work. Only one image is visible once posted AND baldly cropped into a forced horizontal dimension. Then if I tap into enlarging the photo. It still only shows 1 photo and not the 3 that I posted.
Another issue, is that I tried to revert to posting just a single photo but for some reason, that single photo fails to appear; only the post copy shows in the feed.

Please fix the app.
Almost there

For example, I may set a filter to hybrid and then decide to deselect hybrid and select remote, but the filter has both checked. So I reset the filters and try again, but it still keeps both options selected. Another example is a filter being deselected when I apply another filter. For instance, I apply the filter for Experience Level and then apply a filter for On-site/remote, but the Experience Level filter is then deselected. The job search experience on LinkedIn is miserable.",1
2019-08-22 17:16:19,Useless,"Been using linkedin for years have yet to get anywhere using the app. I feel like the app is just another scheme to get all your information. You post all your info and photos to this site expecting to get somewhere within your career field and it’s just a site people put their info on and never look back at it again. 

What needs to be looked into is how often are people logging into the site? If its months and years in between logins then this site is useless. 

I’ve tried to use the app with an open mind, but it simply doesn’t work.

Issues I experienced today 2019 is searching for jobs it will show you the jobs, but click on them and try to get more information and I always get opps, not you, something went wrong. 

Looks like it’s time to consolidate my online profiles and delete the profiles that I no longer have a use for. With linkedin being at the top of that list. Linkedin has turned into a kids safe zone style facebook. Where people post memes and all you can do is like or comment. They seem to be more focused on that stuff and not the job seeker side.",1

I might have used the app once a day to check the feed and maybe find useful work related news to read about. But the constant contact gathering windows, the “give me your contacts from your phone”, the “give me your email credentials” B*S* has left me no option but to uninstall the app.

Now I will maybe go to the website once or twice a month.  LINKEDIN, your contact gathering initiative has backfired terribly on you.  

You cannot use this app to do what you want to do (read news, find jobs, find people you know, etc) because LINKEDIN constantly tries to steer you into doing something else that is to add value to their business.

Extremely unfair and it takes weeks to verify your identity. It’s mind boggling that a big corporation like this can’t hire a customer support team.

The page received a large number of solicitations from “advisors” in a short time, which was followed by a LinkedIn notice to me to not use mass marketing software.  I was surprised since I mostly respond to notifications and not initiate them.

At this point I can see that notifications have come in but cannot retrieve them. My profile is gone and I cannot respond to inquiries of positions available or invitations to add to my list or respond to messages or invitations from LinkedIn. 

My LinkedIn page is now split between two different emails. When I try to log in the LinkedIn “bot” warns me that there are 99+ people on LinkedIn with my unique name.

Well, as much as I love the LinkedIn product (seriously, I'm happy with the amount of contacts I've received from recruiters lately for my specialty), this app is a privacy-disregarding piece of garbage, and may need to be reported to either Apple or, even worse, some sort of government agency.",1

Love the way that it invites you to fill out your profile since it engages you with a meter that fills every time that you do something. But the thing that keeps it from 5 stars is that when it asks you to submit a profile picture, or work experience, or almost anything else you have to try multiple times by starting over, entering the same information again, and hope that it accepts your information. Pressing the “add to profile” or “save” feature virtually does nothing. Very frustrating, but everything else is pretty flawless.",3

I have two phone numbers and just switch from primary to secondary to keep my data useage down on my Verizon line.

Knowing who is looking at your profile can help determine if the company that is looking at your page is something you are actually qualified for, or help you decide if you need to tweak something or pay money to someone who can help with your resume.

Auto-playing video
I’ve never been a fan, and specifically make a point to quickly skip over anything that auto-plays. My time is worth more than being distracted by some video that I didn’t want to see in the first place.

Pop-up banner ads
The most recent update apparently has banner ads that pop up at the bottom of the screen blocking portions of the news feed. I’m fine with in-line ads, but pop-ups are just annoying.

Private message ads
When I see a notification in my messages, I no longer know if it’s someone legitimately trying to contact me, or if it’s a paid ad that I have to specifically go out of my way to ignore. Again, my time is worth more to me than that.

Maybe they’re just trying some of these out, and are open to user feedback. But if this stays around for too long, I think I’ll delete the app, and substantially lower my use of LinkedIn.",2

Now it “expands up” and I have to scroll back up to get the the beginning of the post to read all the text.

You’d think LinkedIn’s photo editing options would help, but no - the colors remain unacceptable, even adjusting with the filters.

I have to maintain my organization’s page as well, so I am unfortunately on the site often enough to keep my inbox clear, and yet the app and the site are always bombarding me with notifications and flags about activity that is not even real.

It’s counterproductive & I’ll probably delete the app if simple functionality cannot be restored. 

Also would help if you could manage company pages from the app. Seeing as this is a business based platform it would make sense to be able to do that on the app rather than wrestle with the abysmal way it’s laid out on the mobile browser.

Anytime I am reading something and need to leave the app and access notes, or a search engine, for example, when I come back to the LI app, it automatically refreshes, and I lose the article I was reading. No amount of searching has ever let me find it again. If I forget to save the article, it is lost and the project I was framing/working on is also lost. 

Recommendations:
-Don’t automatically refresh the page when you leave the app open in the background. Refresh manually (drag and hold down) or refresh when you open the app new. 
-Provide a reading history to go back to where you left off.

When I tried to click to message it said I wasn’t able to message the person unless I used the phone application. So I went agreed and downloaded the application for my phone. After signing in and finding his account again when I clicked message it now gave me a message that said I needed to sign up for a premium subscription.

I have to go through each one and delete it one at a time. I think there should at least be an option to delete all expired jobs at once. Another thing, the jobs that are applied does NOT go to or have the option to move it to the applied section unless you applied the position with LinkedIn Easy apply. Yes, i should keep my own record of where I apply but it would be great to keep it all in one place and it would be easier to track.",3

The premium is an absolute bust. You get a couple of statistical insights, but they add zero value to you as a prospective employee. If you have a presence on any other social media platform, you don’t need LinkedIn. I’ve applied to hundreds and hundreds of positions on LinkedIn, and the only employers that will reach out to you want you to do door to door sales for minimum wage (or less/none) and an absolutely laughable level of commission. Having an account is cool, but the premium is 100% unnecessary and overpriced beyond reason.",2

Glad I read customer reviews, and I don’t need any help any longer,  I WILL NOT SET UP AN ACCOUNT , thanks to all the reviews I read .. y’all have all long way to go before providing a good product to the public .

The “Your invitation to ____ is on it’s way” is incredibly slow and intrusive. It also covers the top of the screen which means you can’t close a profile, close a photo, use the search, etc. You have to wait for the notification to go away. Very poorly designed.

I’ve looked everywhere for a dark mode, which apparently does not exist on the iOS app. I attempted to utilize the Help section in the app, but could not get the live chat to connect. I continuously encountered an error saying a connection to the server could not be made.

2021-02-07 07:27:10,LinkedIn has mediocre support,I recently opened a support case with LinkedIn as I found a defect within the App. If you try to remove a connection and then re-launch the App the connection re-appears. No errors are given. However this isn’t an issue via a regular internet browser. Support keeps asking me for the connection to repro however I already deleted this person via the UI. What does support do? Close my case yet I found a legitimate bug. The level of customer satisfaction I was given was extremely lacking. I really hope I can fill out a survey to provide feedback from a consumer perspective. My message to LinkedIn go above and beyond for your customers. Try just a little bit. Have accountability!,1

The app crashes at unfortunate moments. It has crashed several times as I’ve been writing posts (and it has lost them). It has crashed as I’ve been filling in applications for positions. It did that on me today. Now I have no idea which vacancy I was applying to.

The chat room (news discussion, postings discussions) are way too much of a zoo. In fact, so much of a zoo, I wonder whether people on are really professionals or children. 

Looking at the lists of names I see many fake names, names of cartoon characters etc being used. Since that’s acceptable, I’d rather like a feature that allows me to change my name when I get bored with it. Maybe one day I might be Ermintrude another day, Dylan or Brian or perhaps Zebedee. Maybe even Florence.",3

this app is also full of constant junk messages from temp job recruiters in india, my profile doesn’t even say i’m open to work. there’s also a disturbing amount of tracking that this app does, and it takes 20+ clicks to turn it all off within 5 different menus. and linkedin had a data breech and they didn’t contact anyone and when i asked a support agent about it they stopped answering me. i open this awful app now and i’m attacked by 500 awful pro life posts talking about how companies are “killing babies” to keep the workforce “more productive”. like what? i even check marked your dumb “don’t give me political content” box and i’m still seeing these absolute lunatics on my feed.",1

You can’t buy additional services in Premium if you bought via Apple. The app is limited. They will make you cancel and re-subscribe via LinkedIn and the two companies do not talk.

This is all wasted space that could be used for zooming in to make text and posts larger and more readable. A prior version of this app allowed zooming in on the content for readability.  Really dislike the direction this app has been taking. Makes me conclude that Microsoft (LI’s owner) doesn’t care about accessibility one bit.  Devs, please reincorporate pinch-to-zoom ASAP, as not everyone has perfect eyesight — we need to be able to make the posts larger for readability.

Hey, did you guys realize that email can be used to send messages? Yes, but they wanted to drive visits to their site to inflate their metrics.

To add another you must retype your entire search term—every time!  This is infuriating because it doesn’t even save your previous term. Adding insult to injury, you CAN tick off terms from their initial list of suggestions based on your work history, but not for your own searches.

So I lost my account which I used for 10 years because my legal name doesn’t  match my legal name. When I tried to create a new account, again  they suspended my account and demanded to verify my account.

As a result, you will often see their highest degrees at the bottom, instead of them being on top,  because the way the system aligns them. For example, their Master’s or Ph.D will be at the bottom and while their bachelor is on top. I think the user should be given total control to move their qualifications up or down as they see appropriate.

I figured the programmers have just not gotten around to fixing it. But it seems more likely that they don’t even know it exists. Of course nowadays most everyone has access to WiFi connections, but there are times where there are power outages and it would be just peachy if this app actually functioned without WiFi and only LTE available.

I wrote LinkedIn via snail mail to explain and provided backup on how I know the latest 15 people invited and requested that the warning be rescinded So far no known response.

With LinkedIn now willing to serve the interest of China over you and me its users, I’d give them negative stars with a negative rating if possible.

Linkedin app starts fine but as soon as I scroll 2 or 3 pages down, it immediately hangs and never responds back.  This is not some small bug,  it completely makes app unusable.

This kind of basic issue is reflective of Linkedin QA and dev quality or probably because as someone said, with ad based Free service you are not consumer who comes first for company, but you are the product.  This is probably why app was released to general public with such basic issue.  it is not simply your post disappearing or not showing up which I have seen in past which I accepted as part of free service deal, but app simply hanging is not acceptable even for free service.",1

2.- you sign in with your LinkedIn credentials, and INEVITABLY that takes you to a LinkedIn page with a drawing of two construction workers and a brief message that says “page doesn’t exist”.  Or shows you the infamous 404 http error.   

This happens EVERY. SINGLE.  TIME. !!!! 

And same goes for the “easy apply” button sometimes.   

Developers :  huge fail, on a point in time when there are millions of people looking for a job.   Measure up !!!",1
2020-12-11 13:12:52,So un-usable at the moment,"Updated: deleting and re-downloading the app fixed this bug. Now it is very helpful when looking at professional updates and responding to messages. 

For some reason, the app auto-logs out and now requires signing back in even if you reopen it after 10 minutes. Kind of defeats the purpose of being able to keep up in real time with professional news and alerts, if you have to re-enter email and password so often. Didn’t use to do this.",4
2020-04-01 15:57:09,Can't update your app anymore,"??Impossible to download, because of iTunes glitch that Apple is not fixing

Dear developer, it's impossible for us to download your app or buy new ones from iTunes Enterprise MAC that is used both by businesses, schools and individuals who can't afford to download the same app several times for each device.

Please let Apple know about this issue. For the time being till the issue is going to be resolved, we will not be able to update your apps. Thanks for your support!",4
2021-04-26 12:35:58,Feed is frozen - Updated rating,"For some reason, perhaps an app update, the feed started working again. With a functional feed, the app works great for me and I do a lot of work with it. I recommend LinkedIn to business colleagues all the time and am glad to have the app in my iPhone.

My feed doesn’t advance despite reinstalls, reboots and other efforts. Is this a bug? A problem related to the most recent iOS update (14.4.2)? Can’t tell and the feed is frozen.",4
2018-09-05 19:09:37,"Buggy, slow, random losses of state and drafts",The performance of the app leaves a lot to be desired. I think this might have to do with the fact that the app isn’t truly native to iOS. Instead it’s just framework port of the actual website. The worst aspect of the app is that it randomly dumps the state of the app that you’re working on when LinkedIn forces the “news feed” to update. You end up losing the article that you were reading or the comment that you were drafting. It’s incredibly frustrating and it would be much better if the app were written from the ground up by actual iOS developers.,2
2018-06-08 10:34:27,Seriously.... Still no improvements,"2018 I re-downloaded the app to see if it had improved since my awful, unusable experience years ago. It's even worse. I couldn't even access my profile to make changes. Ridiculous. Re-deleted.

2010 review The only reason I use linkedin is due to my groups membership and I only downloaded this because I thought I could keep up with updates to these groups on my iPhone..... No luck.... Please.... What are you waiting for? I can't update my profile either, as too busy in work to work on it so thought this app could help me stay updated while on way to or from work... Again... No luck... Am deleting this useless tool.",1
2023-09-23 15:16:29,LockedOut,"Pathetic way to treat users. The in-app browser isn't as functional as one which is standalone, yet you can't open links elsewhere let alone copy links. In addition, any element you can add to your account (such as a group, or connection) should also be removable as well.

Worst of all, if you’re entering form data on a page and switch apps to get info to complete the form, expect the garbage LinkedIn app to close the web view and lose any progress you made, because LinkedIn isn’t interested in being useful to you. They’re only interested in you consuming content so they can shove ads down your throat.",1
2023-02-17 20:46:24,Have fun starting an application over 10+ times,"Do you need to go to another app to copy and paste something from your resume? Would you like to look something up, or have your answers prepared in another document? WELL TOO BAD now you get to start that entire application over and we didn’t save ANY of it. I don’t care if this application is asking for you to answer 10 different questions and upload multiple documents you better be READY to answer them all without changing your screen once. Not my problem buddy. Auto save feature? What even is that? Just goes to show nobody wants to work these days.",1
2022-01-01 19:20:26,Freezing While Scrolling,"Ever since the update to iOS 15, LinkedIn keeps freezing during scrolling while on the job search results. It has not gotten any better with the two or three updates to the app since then. As soon as the screen stops moving and you try to scroll again, the page is unresponsive until you try two or three more times. This is super frustrating. Aside from that, general usability has been ok. Though, it took forever to get dark mode rolled out.",3
2021-02-19 00:00:11,Truly impossible to enjoyably browse.,"This app has gone so far off the rails in usability that it’s hardly worth using if you have reasonable PC access. I can’t tell what’s a post, a share, or an advertisement half of the time and by the time I start to resolve that and scroll on? The screen starts rearranging trying to jam another ad through and I lose my place only to see the post I was about to view is no longer in the feed. 

Basically, the app is much too bloated. Ad if LinkedIn’s exorbitant monthly subscription fees are the only way to make the app tolerable, I’ll pass.",3
2019-03-11 21:45:38,Don’t get premium,"Basic LinkedIn is decent, gets the job done. I tried the free 30 day trial period and mistakenly forgot to end and was charged $60 for the next month. That’s my fault, but I still can’t even see who is looking at my profile. “A job recruiter has viewed your profile, add more info to see who.” I have nothing else to fill out, I am a LinkedIn all-star with full job titles and descriptions, education and certifications submitted as well as recommendations and over 400 connections. If I have to pay $60 for the month, it better be awesome, but it isn’t.",3
2018-06-28 17:54:44,Performance,"I like this product and use it all the time for making connections, but over the last two years I’m surprised by how bad the engineering quality of the iOS app has become. 
In this update I could tell the cells in the news feed got a nice redesign but the scrolling experience becomes even worse than before, my screen could literally freeze for a half second when scrolling up and down. However I had experienced worse bug before that it didn’t allow me to pay for subscription, and comparing to that this is nothing. I just feel sad for your guys.",2
2018-03-06 13:56:41,Unsaving items needs fixing,"In general the app works well for me, except for unsaving items.  The three little dots you’re supposed to tap to bring up the unsave option are too small, so I often end up repeatedly re-opening the article I just read.  And more times than not, when I finally do get to the unsave option, it doesn’t actually unsave the article, so I end up having to select unsave multiple times. It’s a big waste of time and really frustrating to start reading an article only to realize I’ve already read it.",3
2023-08-09 21:24:44,Use zip recruiter if you want a job,"For a full month and a half, I applied to jobs like crazy on this app. All I got was email after email after email saying they were not interested. (These are jobs I am qualified for and have relevant experience for). Two weeks on zip recruiter and I found a well paying job with benefits, without lowering my standards at all.

I am not sure if LinkedIn’s algorithm for vetting people is just awful or if people use LinkedIn to make it seem like their business is growing when it’s not. Either way, it is a social media app first. Don’t be fooled like I was.",2
2023-07-14 03:30:33,Horrible service,"I set up an account and had worked on it almost 3 days during a transitioning course in the military and on the 4th day I was logged off and put on restriction until I verified my account with a source of ID. After sending in my information with my source of ID I waited and got an email on the same day that my account has been permanently restricted but won’t say anything on why it was restricted due to violating a user agreement policies which I haven’t violated anything. And when I was trying to figure out a way I could contact them, the only way possible is to have an account which I don’t have access to.",1
2022-09-14 23:40:49,Can’t select messages,"The message icon in the top right corner of the screen does not work. Users are unable to select it and can only access LinkedIn messages through iPhone notifications. Obviously, this is important functionality that premium members pay for! iOS 15 iPhone 12 Pro Max. Update: Uninstall and reinstall worked. Messages can be accessed as expected.",5
2019-12-28 15:07:08,Good - But Better with Landscape Mode and Larger Fonts,"This is one of my favorite apps, but it is uncomfortable to read for any length of time, because the Font is so small.  My only request is that the font is too small to read comfortably.  If you could allow the reader to choose between even a small, medium or large font and to use this in landscape mode it would be fantastic!!!!   Take a look a what Time magazine's application does.  Nice Application though.

Support for Dark Mode would also be helpful.",4
2020-01-28 04:09:38,Most frustrating app ever,"It took me 15 minutes to simply log in to the app even though I have been using the web version for a couple years. The app kept trying to sign in with Google.
Once I was signed in to my account, the app forced me to press ‘skip for now’ on four different pages trying to get me to connect with more people.
The app overall is slow and buggy. There are many popups in the usual LinkedIn fashion of trying to get more ‘connections’. At some point, I want to use the app for what I want to do on it instead of having to skip through all the crap that LinkedIn forces to pop up.

My advice: stick to the web version as the lesser of two evils.",1
2019-03-18 15:59:50,Great app but don’t like some notifications with no content,"LinkedIn is great and puts job searching and career networking at your fingertips. It does the job and I liked how you can get instant messaging and notifications about your network. My only complaint is that I get a red 1 “Notification” everyday, and sometimes it only says “You’re all caught up” when I open the app. It’s pretty irritating. For me, it’s solely there to make sure I open the app everyday and I wish that feature was removed.",4
2019-07-01 17:24:58,Professional Social Media,"Social Media can bring out the worst in people, allowing them to grand stand, berate and criticize others. Linked -In on the other hand, brings people together, allowing them to connect with others in sharing professional interests, success stories and celebrating the good wool of others. It is the only forum I use. 
As a retired educator, I can keep in touch with colleagues and former students, while connecting with many of their contacts.",5
2019-01-27 06:30:34,Making people victim for their poor Rules coding,Poor coding says that I use automated machine to send connections and Invite. It feels frustration even though you use Iphone and there no such thing called automation to view and send connections to profiles. 2 warnings and then blocks the account. I have 9000+ connections next time they said am gonna get permanently blocked for sending connections? So much effort went in to find those valuable connections. LinkedIn is for networking and if they stop me from doing it then this is one of the worst networking app. It's not just me but 25people in my organization got permanently banned bacause of their poor coding strategy. I wouldn't recommend this app.,1
2018-04-21 05:51:57,Serves its purpose BUT why can’t I post to my company page from the app?,"He app is good for personal/individual use and it has served its purpose for searching for candidates and jobs for many years.   However, with so many other social options for posting as a business this app is far behind.  There is no way to post articles or photos or updates to my LinkedIn company page as a company page admin.  Why?  It’s 2018 and it’s time to make this change.  Thank you for your consideration.",4
2018-12-13 14:24:31,Can’t even report an error!,"Overall I have no issues with the app except when something in the programming breaks and it continues to tell me I have notifications but I don’t! When I try to report it and attach a screen shot, it kicks me back to the main page that loads when I open the app. Seems like the problem isn’t consistent either. The notification issue will happen for a month or 2, then get fixed for a while, then come back. But to not even be able to report it easily is ridiculous. I have even gone to the website from my laptop to check the notifications in hopes that the app would remove them but nope!",1
2023-04-01 23:35:37,Chat keeps crashing the app,"I’ve lost more than a dozen drafts in the last few versions. It either crashes in the middle of typing, or hangs and takes up to 60 secs to send. When it crashes, sometimes my draft is partially there, but often it’s completely gone. When it hangs, the text is gone, arrow grays out, and you’re left wondering if the message sent. Sometimes I will go to highlight one or two words to correct them, then all the text disappears, forcing me to start over.",3
2022-10-10 23:10:46,Customer Service,"This complaint is in the form of a review due to the lack of customer service availability. While I respect what you platform does the availability of customer service and help is lacking. Also, more specific to the reason I was reaching out after creating 90% of a very important communication with a prospective future employer when I received a call and all was lost. All I needed was an answer is the message recoverable. This is not addressed on your help page and investing in any customer relations apparently is not the Linked In way. Disappointing is all I have to say.",2
2020-06-21 13:11:45,Could be better,"I’m not trying to say someone needs to be fired, but your team needs to have a serious sit down and actually take into account all issues brought up by other customers.

My complaint and review (which is rare, I hate writing reviews) is because I utilized LI to find a job in the past and support the concept of social networking in the work force.

I never had significant issues with the App until it began repeating push notifications exactly three times in a row, the same notification. I want notifications on, but I don’t want to be spammed with them one after the last goes off screen. It’s distracting, happens at random times, and sometimes causes me to unintentionally open the app because I was playing a game or trying to click the text field for the web browser, but instead are whisked away to LI because of these annoying push notifications.

Please fix this issue and I’ll consider changing my review.",2
2021-12-23 17:26:26,Mario Manriquez Review,"I’ve had the pleasure of working with Mario, and was impressed daily by his professionalism.  He’s a very patient person.  His approach is kind and generous even under difficult circumstances.  There is no task he doesn’t approach with enthusiasm.  I would recommend him in any environment as he is a real pleasure to work with.  He always gets the job done in a timely fashion and with a great attitude.  I count him among my friends and admire him greatly.",5
2023-10-04 16:59:38,Not Great On Phone,"Not sure why, but I only receive “promoted” jobs as options while browsing roles on mobile, these usually do not match my profile which makes searching for jobs on the app much worse than the browser. Also after having LinkedIn premium for about half a year I can say it is pretty unnecessary, the jobs they recommend saying “top applicant” usually do not even bother with an interview opportunity. It is frustrating when LinkedIn tells you that you are a “top applicant” and you never actually hear back.",2
2023-07-18 20:28:02,Eh it’s okay,"LinkedIn is not as good as it once was. It became more like Facebook than a job search site. LinkedIn never found me a job even though I applied for several. LinkedIn does not give much help when it comes to resume building, networking, or help actually landing the job you qualify for. The only reason I pay for LinkedIn is for LinkedIn learning, but that doesn’t help in any way getting a job, it just keeps my knowledge fresh. 
Overall LinkedIn in has been a rather disappointing job search app.",3
2022-03-08 15:02:09,"Great app, needs improvement","I love LinkedIn, but I have some major gripes with it. First, we need to be able to upload larger photos. For some reason they use resolution rather than file size. This means that anyone uploading photos with a full frame camera will not only have to reduce the file size, but crop the image. No other major platform requires you to crop a landscape photo in order to post. When searching for a new job, the search is also pretty bad. It rarely shows relevant results.",3
2017-11-01 16:00:35,Great use of time,"Rather than scrolling through mindless numbness of other apps or games, LinkedIn provides network building and self development. It promotes self development articles and allows you to build a network of like minded people and also puts you in touch with people you look up to. You get to then read what those people find interesting and thats what helps inspire me to be a better person and colleague.",5
2021-10-25 09:56:37,Don’t want feedback?,"After a recent update, every post by Blue Lives Matter, when clicking on the link for the provided article, causes the App to lock up.  Hasn’t happened with any other post. Tried to find a way of letting LinkedIn know about this, and there doesn’t seem to be a method of providing feedback, except through reviews.  So, it’d be nice if y’all could fix the problem with Blue Lives Matter’s posts, and would be especially nice if you included a  method of providing feedback on the app.",3
2020-10-19 15:05:09,Do not do the free trial of premium!,"I really do like LinkedIn with the free stuff. They kept advertising to do the 30 day trial for free. I tried it out and I didn’t care for it. Some of it was nice but not for $30 a month. If I don’t have a job, why would I waste $30 a month on the chances of someone maybe liking my profile? I tried to cancel the free trial and it told I had to contact apple to cancel. Why do I need to contact apple to stop a free trial with LinkedIn? Doesn’t make sense. After they charged my account on day 31 of having the premium it allowed me to cancel on the app. Bottom line: do not try the premium with LinkedIn. It’s a scam",2
2019-02-18 04:58:14,Job Search Feature Not Working,"I am not sure when your newest update came out, but for the past 3+ weeks when I go to look at different jobs it says “no job recommendations.” It won’t even show me the current alerts I have, jobs I’ve saved, etc. I never had this problem before, and now I can’t actually look for anything. 

When I type in a specific job and location, including alerts I current have, recommendations will pop up. But I don’t want to have to do that every time and I want the ability to see my saved jobs and saved alerts. 

The other job search app doesn’t work as well as what this one did before, so I don’t like to use it. It doesn’t give the option to delete/remove a recommendation if I know that I do not want that position. 

It would be wonderful if this could be fixed or if someone could help me with this issue.",3
2017-11-22 03:34:34,Way too many notifications!,"There's a lot of notification configurations, but I could never find a way to get it to only notify me if there was a message sent directly to me. The app kept notifying me when it thought I might know somebody, or somebody I knew posted something, and so on! I will say it's possible that I could have better configured the notifications, but I'm a software developer by trade, so if I can't figure it out by myself that's kind of a ""fail"" in my book. I ultimately uninstalled the app because nobody seems to use LinkedIn unless they're headhunting or actively looking for a job, anyway.",2
2023-10-26 20:01:11,Where is Customer Support?,"Dear Linkedin, I have been a premium LinkedIn member for over six years and since being a member, I have received endless spam from businesses on my email. I tried to contact customer support but there is no direct way to email or call them. The live chat feature is limited to Premium members and if you canceled your Premium, that’s basically it. There is an opportunity to evolve and elevate your customer success and service design. If you are catering to helping people get jobs and build powerful networks, it also starts with the foundation of working on your customer service team.",1
2023-02-14 15:39:44,Paying to Message?,"I’ve always liked using LinkedIn. It’s been a great way to connect with people, network, and is easy to use. It helped me find a job when I was moving to a different state. Now I’m trying to switch careers and in order to message someone I have to pay for a premium subscription? This had made it really hard to meet someone in the field I’m interested in. I wish it was still free to message because now I have no way of reaching different people in this field.",3

Also posts from groups you are in do NOT appear on your newsfeed, you have to physically search and click on the group to view the posts. What is the point of groups at that point?? No excuse as to why something so simple is unavailable on the mobile app. Get it together app developers, and make the mobile experience better for your users.",2
2022-02-28 23:45:43,Terrible Profile Settings experience,"In general the app is okay. However, when it comes to updating any sort of preference relating to my account, that is terribly difficult.

At least 4 recruiters contacted back but never stayed in touch. I encountered at least 12 phishing websites disguised as job listings. Check the data privacy settings.

They literally collect what you do outside of the app. :) Especially what others apps you download and how you use/what you type in them. They also keep track of what you buy online that’s not on LinkedIn. Your pictures aren’t safe either as they can browse through them and sneakily listen to you on the microphone.",1
2023-08-17 18:59:03,Got kicked off and don’t know why,"I was posting things to help coach people and suddenly LinkedIn blocked my account and deleted it. I still don’t know why. Not too impressed. 

Cliche quotes, status quo information, and other societal “truths” seem to rule the people’s beliefs and what they support on the platform.

If you differ from that, and challenge beliefs etc, good luck. That may be social media and dealing with people in general, but the fact that I got blocked and still have no idea why, seems strange to me. Anyway, wishing everyone the best. But this platform could improve in that area.",2
2022-11-18 18:08:01,App is great However…,"When searching for a job the “on-site, remote, hybrid” drop down needs more options to include traveling. Or maybe a separate drop down that includes the percentage of travel. So 0% is what I would choose.

The overall user experience is annoying and inconvenient. It would be nice if these issues could be remedied.",3
2022-01-31 02:22:22,Needs an archive function for old jobs,"As a networking and job application app, LinkedIn’s job catergorization page is very lackluster. People should be able to archive old jobs they weren’t interviews or selected for, very similar to Indeed’s platform (where you can label jobs as Applied, Interviews, Not Selected, etc). I’m suprised this already isn’t a feature as I’m sure it would do wonders for logistics in promoting the usability and functionality of LinkedIn as a job posting platform and not just a social media network.",3

The count will jump from 250 to 150 to 170 and everywhere in between right before my eyes.  Also, the count of profile views goes up, but no additional people are added to the list of who’s viewed the profile.   And as the number of proclaimed views goes up, the percentage compared to last week goes down!   There are some real issues with the statistics shared in this app.",3

Logged in one day to find my acct. had been compromised. Pw changed on me and I couldn’t log in. I went to appeal and they asked me to send photos of my id.

I did and eventually got a reply that sounded human “I'm sorry for not having a quick answer about your issue. I've forwarded your message to another group for additional review and advice.”

And eventually, I get this cryptic response telling me I’m banned, without ever explaining why :( 

“We've deemed the activity in your account is in violation of the LinkedIn User Agreement and Professional Community Policies. Your appeal has been denied and your account has been restricted permanently.”

I don’t know what the person who hacked my acct. did, but it doesn’t seem reasonable or even decently ethical to ban me as a result… I’m not even sure what people do to get banned on LinkedIn",1

Now when I search by city/state, I don’t have any radius options. With that, I am giving it 4 stars since it’s become an inconvenience to only have radius search accessible on my laptop as opposed to the app. Please fix it. Radius search is critical!!!",4

I have tried looking through your FAQs and contacting support but have had no luck. This feels like a bug and one that I hope gets resolved soon as it’s highly annoying.

At first I thought it was signal related because I was at work and I don’t always have the best signal in the building. Then it happened everywhere when I wasn’t connected to wifi.

You have to start a subscription to even get the trial and they are hoping you forget to cancel after the month so you keep getting charged. That’s sad and pathetic. I will never try your trial because of this, even if I ended up liking premium. Stop being money grubbers and give a real free trial, and then at the end send a message saying the trial has ended and if I would like to sign up then I can.

If these offers expire after a while, how about you put the expiration date on them or better yet, take them down from the inmail, so people don’t get charged like I did! It would be lovely to get my money back if someone actually reads this.",2
2021-09-11 10:13:25,App doesn’t work with some iPhones,"Unfortunately, I have been redirected to the Linkedin website whenever I opened the app for the past couple of days. This is because the latest app update requires IOS 13 or later which is not supported by Apple for many iPhone devices, such as iPhone 6. Is there anything you guys can do about it? You know the Linkedin website is not as user-friendly as the app for sure!",4
2019-02-12 08:17:43,Still unusable,"Useless bloatware.  Back to unbelievably slow and essentially useless.  I refuse to wait 2-3 minutes just to view a current connection.  Neither is it reasonable for me to have to periodically delete and reinstall the app. Enough!

After my review below, I received a note from app support to uninstall and reinstall the app.  Indeed, LinkedIn is much more responsive now ( though still very laggy about loading articles and during app start-up)

So unbelievably slow, an exercise in futility.  I had falsely assumed this app would let me access LinkedIn easily, but that is not so.  I should not be able to pull espresso shots between page loads.",1
2018-10-10 03:17:30,Feedback: One star for visibility,"Hello LinkedIn dev team,

I used to not use LinkedIn as much as I do now. Thanks to you for providing us with so many new features that are being added. This is how a real social network should have always been.

The reason for 1 star is:
I am an ardent follower of the daily rundowns. But, I wouldn’t read all the content in a single go. Instead, I take multiple turns throughout the day to read all of it. Here’s the problem. 

When I open LinkedIn and say, read two paragraphs and went on to read an email and then do my chores and then come back to LinkedIn after, say, an hour, to pick up where I left off. This is where LinkedIn redirects me to its home page. No, I didn’t close the app, it’s running in the background. I would love to continue with the content where I left it off earlier. 

I have seen no other app does this except LinkedIn.

TL;DR I want LinkedIn to show me the content where I left off earlier than always redirecting me to homepage.",1
2022-11-23 15:06:00,Comments not working,LinkedIn app appears to have a bug or a new setting that doesn’t allow comments on certain posts — since the past 2 updates. You click on “comment” and your phone’s keyboard pops up and allows you to type but you can’t see what you are typing (just shows older comments) and there is no button to post what you blindly typed. LinkedIn also makes it virtually impossible to provide feedback or report a bug. They clearly do NOT want to hear from their platform users. Thus this review.,2
2019-10-25 08:34:09,Annoying notifications,"Badge notifications are so common, they’re useless. I only want numbered badge notifications for messages. Instead, the app gives notifications on everything—-whenever any of my 500+ contacts posts anything, which is all the time.  Very very annoying.  This makes notifications effectively useless.  Maybe someone should send the LinkedIn app dev team a copy of The Boy Who Cried Wolf.",5
2020-12-15 02:34:48,Latest update is bad news,"I have to re login on every. Single. Launch. FIX IT NOW! Also, I think you people highly overestimate how much people want your platform for content. Right now, all the sections (notifications, jobs, people) are telling me “something went wrong” and it isn’t functional. But the feed—the thing I neither want nor need—is working just fine. This is garbage. The new interface is cleaner. I applaud your UX designers for bringing you forward from 2013. But I’d gladly take the old UI working again over this horrible update. I get you’re working on it but c’mon—this is basic stuff. This release never should have made it out of the gate.",1
2018-05-10 01:49:25,App force closes,"I am on iOS 11.3.1. Each time I open the app and navigate to an inmail and click on the text box to start typing a response, the app force closes. I read a couple of the developer response to uninstall and reinstall the app. I did that but it didn’t solve the problem. You guys need to fix this bug.

Update:
I just updated to the latest version and I don’t see the app close. I guess it’s fixed. Thanks!",5

I love that all my work and volunteer history is saved and is easily found and read by others seeking talent. How nice to be found vs. always looking. I recommend LinkedIn to everyone, it’s the present and future of recruitment and job search. Thank you!",5
2018-12-28 22:47:52,Can’t even create an account,"I know this is a great platform, however the app for the iPhone won’t even let me create an account, due to the robot security feature.

2022-07-28 18:29:39,Horrible Update,"Won’t save job postings all of the time; have to click multiple times and this was for each posting I wanted to save. 

I try to enter in a “mileage filter,” and it doesn’t work EVER. I pick 5 or 10 miles and I still get results for 30 miles away (into the city which can be a 60 minute to a 3 hour drive), not to mention hundreds to THOUSANDS of miles away. 🙄 And yes I know how to use the app. You just rolled out a horrible update. This is by far the worst update ever. At this point, it’s looking as pitiful as Carrerbuilder was 20 years ago.",2

Can you please make accessibility for older generation iPhones and iOS? Thank you!",3

When I clicked the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the emails they were sending me, instead of taking me to a page I could unsubscribe from email notifications, it took me to the homepage of the app. I had to navigate to this page myself. 

The app itself also is not user friendly. It’s hard to find the information you were just editing after you hit save.",1
2019-12-05 05:43:33,Need improvements,"I appreciate the app however I'd like to be able to multi-select various options.   I'd also like to be able to scroll to the bottom and automatically get more jobs rather than having to click the button. The recent update seems to have removed the ability to select the category such at technology and healthcare.   The recent update has also created an annoying ""get alerts"" message at the bottom that pops up and disappears each time you scroll.",3
2017-11-22 03:09:13,LinkedIn App is making it easier,I think the App has improved a lot. The changes with LI some months ago were hard to swallow and frustrating. The App continues to add features that exist on the desktop and in some cases even more benefits. I've noticed most recently that it is making it easier to communicate and also find contacts. Sometimes even providing topics for the conversation -- like to comment on their recent post. This can enhance the conversation.,4
2018-07-24 16:41:19,It’s a great app but...,"LinkedIn really needs to start vetting the companies they allow to post job listings. I got a call from a job post I replied to only to go look up information  about the company and to discover it was nothing more than a glorified pyramid scheme. Same thing happened to my friend, I expect these things on Monster or Indeed but LinkedIn is supposed to be better than this. Please vet the companies you allow to post jobs otherwise there’s this app is pointless.",4
2017-10-03 04:38:47,Offensive.,Do I want to sync????  Are the developers really that stupid that they don’t remember they’ve gotten answer to that question each and every time I’ve tried to use your intrusive app. Or - do they all suffer from untreated narcissistic personality disorder and not give two flying flips  about the privacy wishes of their users and the rights of those contacts not to have their personal information crowd sourced.  What could be an invaluable tool...an app built to create a worldwide professional community instead is an insufferable sham...an app that Commoditize contact information that has been shared with individuals for  personal use...Not to be shared or crowd sourced by a corporation!,1
2021-05-04 14:33:01,Phakedup don’t install,"LinkedIn has become bolshet. The messages inbox icon is on top where the post something personal bolshet icon is in bottom which is very easy and accessible. This way folks are more tempted to post personal drama on LinkedIn. Professionalism is gone!!!! They should be vice versa in the place. 2nd every time there’s update, it has the same description “when you’re in a conversation, speed is important” something like that. Madafaka how much speed do we need to send a basic message and to install more updates is to giving up our privacy since these updates breech your privacy.",1
2020-04-14 17:38:56,Needs significant improvement,"I keep this app because it has so many people and jobs in one place. However, Indeed is far superior in terms of actually managing job applications. I want to be able to archive jobs I’ve applied to through LinkedIn and am no longer in consideration for, as well as keep track of those I’m interviewing for in the app. I feel like this data would be helpful to LinkedIn as well? Right now it’s really difficult to find a job description when someone contacts me for an interview and all the jobs I’ve ever applied to can’t be searched/sorted AT ALL.",2
2019-03-01 12:17:11,Poor functioning application.,"I don’t understand. For a website, that focuses, and emphasizes professionalism, their app is terrible to use. Continuously, when I try to apply to jobs, the app crashes, and can’t even handle me putting in an email, or a simple data entry. I’ll try to open it again, after successfully closing it, and the app CRASHES again. My phone isn’t even old. Then when the app does work, I have to find that job again, and try to re apply. Certain features such as importing your profile for a job employer to see, don’t work. This application is poor, for those of us who work on the move.",1
2018-01-09 02:31:56,Great Networking Site,This is a great way to network business wise. I think I have used  this more to get to know people and businesses that I want to work for. But I just wish the same way you connect with people on the desktop with the small short message should be incorporated with the mobile as well. Its more professional and you get to let the person know why you want to connect with them. This gives more connections to be accepted.,4
2022-08-30 12:25:42,Experiencing glitches. Love the app.,I like LinkedIn! I’m experiencing glitches right now when editing my posts from my iPhone and from my iPad.

The issue is the same for both devices.,5
2023-09-17 16:33:14,"Good opportunities, with glitches","Linked in has been great in searching for jobs or having employers reach out to me.   But there have always been glitches that the company seems to know about but doesn’t do anything to fix them.   I have a very common glitch where it says I have notifications, but when I log in and click the notifications button there is nothing.      It’s hard to know if I actually have a job opportunity or a bug.",3

2021-08-17 20:48:29,A little unorganized,"It would be great if there was a way to sort out the jobs you’ve already applied for. That way the jobs you have an interview for you can mark them for that category. Jobs that have passed on you, maybe you can move to another location or mark as not selected by employer. When you’re really job hunting and putting in lots of applications it’s all jumbled and keeping track of who’s reached out, who’s passed on you gets frustrating.",3

My business account had access to the company page & allowed me to post. However, I didn't know that when merging accounts you lose access. It didnt say that when I merged accounts. I went to get customer service but the help page is useless. Most of the advice was outdated & there was no answer for this. There is no chat box or service agent either (unless you pay the fee). LinkedIn has been a huge pain for this.",1
2021-12-06 10:25:33,They make money by selling your info,So this platform is making more money by selling your info to a third-party company that they use your own info and resell them again plus that they asking you to be premium to pay fees as well they will keep selling your information to make more money either you paying them or not it’s untrusted and I don’t believe that they say it’s number one platform on social media it’s all fake and they always I always get many scammers who called me trying to do a social engineering on me by steeling my information because they got my info from this app :/,1

It takes forever to update information, and sometimes to navigate through the app. Notifications on phone, apparently aren’t sound notifications so it’s hard to keep updated if your preoccupied with other tasks. Again, I love LinkedIn however the app and its technological features could use some tweaking for a more efficient and stress free experience.",3

I rarely will use the app anymore and save any searches for when I’m on my desktop. I’m not sure if it has to do w my settings or what, but LinkedIn is by far the most frustrating app on my phone. I’ve deleted and reinstalled several times.

 I have to resort to removing the app from my phone and using LinkedIn on chrome...but why should I have to do that especially when I’m paying for an expensive LinkedIn premium account? Makes no sense!",1

Unfortunately, the LinkedIn app is laced with bugs and it’s slower than most social media apps. I find the lagging leads to repeated postings, information isn’t saving, and I just realized I’ve wasted 15 minutes trying to update one component of my profile. Total waste of time. 

I’m new to LinkedIn in a sense, but I appreciate its efforts. Still, I think I’ll be sticking to their website version, not this poorly run app.",2

LinkedIn used to be a great tool for business networking and searching for work. Now, since I have to dodge so many ads and pop-ups (a pop up video 4-5x in the middle of watching a video? C’mon!!

One story continues to get “stuck” at the top and will stay there (for days) until I go into the options to hide that post. Once I do that another story gets stuck there. I used to use this app for the feed all the time in those times when I had a few minutes to review and would get caught up in all of the interesting and timely posts.  That isn’t the case any longer.

Hope this app gets some attention soon. UPDATE: In response to the developer response, I’ve mentioned several ways to improve this here. Take this feedback from here don’t make me write it again on your own platform. Rude.",1

So I am concerned about who may have access of the old, and really would like to know what other individual in the United States has authorization to use my other account. This is highly highly not recommended. Especially frustrating because there’s no way to appeal this in the email that I did receive.",2

Most of the time it complains I’m not on the internet, links don’t work etc etc.   This is so bad, you’d be better off just having folks use your website and not having an app at all so people don’t waste their time with it.

It’s been years of having the same problems and you could have easily fixed them by now. Please take this app out of the AppStore or fix it.   Seriously….. I’d rather hit a safari link, use the website and not have this app intercept my requests with failure measages.",1

I see posts about jobs that CLOSED three weeks ago but if someone in my network likes a post completely irrelevant to me, I’ll see that immediately! The social feed function is driven by a truly terrible algorithm that makes LinkedIn irrelevant as an app. I’m better off just visiting the desktop site occasionally to update my profile and check job alerts (and at least that has a sort by time feature).",2

Excluding the weird story feature (which LinkedIn really doesn’t need) I haven’t had any other issues. The app is usually great and mostly easy to navigate. I do wish profiles were set up so that the posts and activities of the users profile you’re on are a little easier to find.

I view someone’s profile while I’m private, and a few minutes later i get a notification that they viewed my profile. This has happened numerous times. You’re telling me this is a coincidence?

It will be interesting to see where Microsoft takes the capabilities over the long term.",5

On top of this it is such a convoluted and complicated process to disable them. For anyone that actually uses notifications for what they’re supposed to be for and makes an effort to stay up to date on things, it’s frustrating to go into the app and find notifications about birthdays and notifications about articles linked to by my network. It’s more annoying than useful, and absolutely pointless, so I’ll be using web based platform instead.",1
2023-10-23 18:19:59,WAYYYYY too many useless notifications,"If LinkedIn was more responsible about not sending repetitive, useless notifications, I wouldn’t have to turn them off completely. I’d like to know when someone engages with me, but I don’t want to be told EVERY FEW HOURS that I have notifications waiting. If I didn’t read them when they came through, I don’t plan to read them until I’m ready. You need to put users first instead of your app open metrics.",3

I’ve submitted my identification 2 or 3 times already and it’s been months and they still haven’t reviewed it. I hate this app, it is so stupid. I only use it because employers for some reason do their hiring through it, even though it’s the dumbest social media platform ever created. 

In addition, people on this app hate freedom of speech and will report you if they don’t agree with your opinions, which is probably why my account got restricted.",1
2022-03-21 04:21:33,Suggestion,I love LinkedIn it’s a pretty good app I always recommend it to people but here are a few suggestions it would be nice if LinkedIn would have their own virtual hiring event through the app virtual breakout rooms where we can get on and video chat or group chat people in our field virtual interviews with the companies/hiring manager that we want to work for also it doesn’t have beauty as a industry on here which is surprising seaming as hair and make up is part of the beauty industry,3

2020-10-28 01:09:56,How can an app in 2020 not offer rotation support?,"App is ok as far as it goes, but it baffles me why the devs do not support rotation. Sometimes the vertical orientation cuts off parts of words in a headline, profile,  etc. Rather than clicking on useless link, I often rotate my phone on other apps/websites to get more in and decide whether to click the link. But not in this app. (Also not on the website, so it’s a conscious decision by LinkedIn.) I installed the app because a couple features weren’t available on the website.",3

Oh didn’t they tell you that these trillion dollar companies have done away with human interaction entirely.

I switch back to LinkedIn, and while most sensible apps would allow you to continue where you left off…nope. Gone. I was like, “No way the app could be this bad,” so I scrolled down to the post I was responding to, hit the Comment button, and sadly…yes, my entire comment was gone. 

Super frustrating experience…I want my 20 minutes back!",1
2018-11-21 17:37:46,“Connect” automatically without an option to leave a note in the app,"I had to use Safari browser to find a person then connect, to have an option to leave a note and not leave a note.

SHAME ON YOU LINKEDIN what a disgrace. All these fake companies that you can’t even find on glassdoor or anywhere else. You would think with all this technology that you could be able to filter out the fake companies but I guess your “developers” aren’t that smart anyways. What a joke of an app.",1

Instead they refunded back to my card and told me to simply buy the plan again

When I went to buy the plan again. I found the price was over $500!   

Went back and forth with customer service who ultimately recommended a purchase a different plan that was closer to what I was paying all these years.

Huh?!

I have decided to now be a free customer.  LinkedIn could have easily fixed my error by accepting my payment.    They chose not to do that and tried to put me the same plan for more than 2X the cost

You’re probably keenly aware of this yet you won’t fix it because you’re trying to get users to engage in the desktop version.

So frustrating that they can’t fix this. The only solution is to turn off the notifications thru my phone settings, causing me to miss actual notifications. The notification settings in the app do nothing. This is a phantom notification that isn’t even there but continues to pop up. Many others have reported this issue yet they still can’t fix it.",1

Ui freezing is not something that an app like LinkedIn should have much less for months on end. If I scroll through 50 results the ui will freeze during scrolling maybe 5 times. Once it froze so long I had to kill the app. Please fix. Just check your apple metrics on hang rate and scrolling.,2

It refreshes to the Home Screen as opposed to going back to the job or application I was working on.  It’s some sort of auto refresh b/c my phone settings won’t even allow me to toggle it on or off.  It may be a glitch that needs updating.  Super annoying and wastes precious time while navigating through my phone and looking for the right/best next opportunity.,2

When I get to the application it shows double of everything double email and phone number fields. It won’t allow me to go to past the resume field. This is frustrating as the main reason I use LinkedIn is to apply to jobs and I can’t seem to do that. Please fix this. Thank you!,4
2017-11-01 15:06:01,"President of HBRC, Inc","LinkedIn in platform is taking strides to educate and sensor content. I truly like the daily news feed! I can choose articles most important to my field or interest. The feature to share multiple images helps any professional display a real sense of their business. I just learned of ""Shared Draft"" and ""Managing Comments"".  Positive features for LinkedIn professionals.",5
2017-10-27 11:26:26,LinkedIn!!,"LinkedIn is a great resource for an entrepreneur! It is always posting tips on business strategies, promoting events and individual accomplishments which get your name and business noticed, again and suggesting connections which open up the possibilities. It is a really great resource for a successful business, especially if you are an entrepreneur. I think it is a valuable social marketing tool.",5
2023-08-17 04:16:05,"Permanently restricted account, no explaination",I strictly used this app to save jobs I was interested in and apply for said jobs. I was locked out of my account “temporarily” so I filed an appeal with needed documentation just to be told 4 days later that my account was permanently restricted with zero explanation as to why. My account was professional and was used for very minimal and basic needs. I’m very disappointed in the lack of customer service with LinkedIn and how it is impossible to reach out for further instruction or explanation without having access to my account.,1
2023-08-06 19:57:52,Atrocious customer support,"LinkedIn's customer service is abysmal, especially for premium account holders like myself. Despite numerous attempts to reach out, they never bother to respond, leaving us stranded with unresolved issues. To add insult to injury, when my account got hacked, they displayed the same level of apathy, taking over 48 hours to address the situation. It's evident that LinkedIn's only purpose seems to be a platform for self-important flagellation, with little regard for its users' concerns and security. A disappointing experience overall. 0 out of 10 would recommend.",1
2023-07-17 02:17:37,Premium scam,I use this app a lot and have for years. I recently signed up for premium but after a months found the $40 price to not be worth it. It says it’s “easy to cancel subscription” and “cancel anytime.” You can’t cancel without going onto a desktop! Which for some is very inconvenient and you can’t delete your payment info on the app or safari from a phone either. This resulted in me being charged for another month that I didn’t want the subscription.,2
2023-06-08 17:29:36,Worst customer service!,5 years ago I had an issue with my primary email address being locked because I left my job. Now I’m going through the same run around where no one uses common sense and they act like their security is protecting me by not giving me access to my contacts and information. My guess is people working here have the same attitude that I have about the company…and that’s why I can’t get this basic issue resolved. Going on 5 days with the same automated responses from some 20 year old process and system.,1
2022-06-18 22:39:43,Stopped working but LinkedIn fixed it.,"The latest update made it unusable. Worked great before then after the it automatically closes before it gets time to open. Huge bug! Linked in devious reached out, asked some questions, bug repaired. About a week to fix. Point is they’re in it.",5
2022-05-05 02:25:07,Terrible App Support,"I have used LinkedIn since it was formed. The app is worthless and limited. The company changes an outrageous price for their site. It is becoming just another Facebook. They remove posts and limit companies posting. All my posts are missing from my company page, and three weeks later, a ticket is still one with no reply. Sad these companies get so big they lose touch with how they are here. Us posting and using their site. Guess time to go back to Facebook. At least there, the app works, and the company pages work.",1
2021-06-05 21:27:06,Awful,"I thought LinkedIn was a platform where intelligent minds meet. For them to censor content backed by scientific inquiry, research and real life findings because they want to control what you may read and think about a subject is utterly disgraceful. Any censorship of science and we are back to the dark ages where so much knowledge was lots at the hands of the Church all in the name of control. How are we there again? Shocking disregard for the truth, scientific process and human right to freedom of speech. If I could give zero, I would. Alas, I have to give the one star they do not deserve in order to write a review!",1
2021-01-09 23:02:45,Not Very Professional,"This platform has seriously devolved in the last couple of years becoming little more than a sounding board for Trump supporters. As a job seeker, your only recourse is to look away because if you post a comment pointing out a false claim, it may reflect badly to a future employer. While there is a feature to report it, I’m certain they don’t actually check (example: I’m pretty sure it’s common knowledge that Trump did not end human trafficking, but LinkIn thought it was ok). Also, not having the ability to selectively not see everyone in your networks activity, is furthering the conflicts.",1
2020-06-23 02:40:10,Job notifications,"Two things really.  You get a notification that a job matches your profile.  Tap on it and it goes to the jobs tab and that specific job is nowhere to be seen on the list.

Also, if you want to give a suggestion or ask a question through app support about such things, there is no way to do it.  Just preset options not related to that particular issue.",4
2019-06-25 20:04:09,Unappealing New UX,"It looked better with the profile picture in the center. It used to look more centered and professional, but now it just looks like it’s trying to be like Facebook..? It’s very unappealing as a professional networking app. It doesn’t look symmetrical, and it puts more emphasis on the cover picture. It just looks off with the company name below the profile picture and the school name beside it while all being left-aligned. Most people don’t have cover pictures, so I don’t understand why even bother making the focus on that? It makes me not want to use it. I wish I didn’t update.",1
2019-06-14 18:59:40,They will steal your money,I was prompted to try the premium subscription for free for a month which I did. I did not give them any of my financial information. I figured that if I liked the services provided by the premium then I would pay to start using it. There were no benefits to the premium and it didn’t help me at all in my career search. Somehow they accessed my bank information and took their ridiculous amount out. When I tried to get a refund they gave me the run around for hours before they all around denied my refund. Awful customer service. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone.,1
2019-05-08 00:06:40,Wow - total lack of customer support w/latest version -,"After finally getting thru the four hundred menu and submenus, today I get a blip of a note that, as I requested support, my account will be blocked unless I build a SECOND page for my still barely operational account.

Cannot recommend this ""tool"" which offers no advantage to a real person, with clear and present preferential treatment given only to fraudsters and the unwary.

In the unlikely event an actual person responds to me and has addressed my main issue -- that I am retired in a different locale than I my three decades of work! -- I will happily revise this conclusion.",1
2023-05-11 01:24:33,Need sort by date for feed on app,App works as expected except the news feed often shows posts that are several days old. Please add an option to sort by date or most recent for the app just as you can on the web version. I am often late to the party since I am constantly seeing posts days later.,4
2018-02-10 13:03:15,Good overall but some key features missing,"I love LinkedIn's networking features and how it helps with professional development, but there are a few critical pieces missing from the app. For example, on the app there isn't a Save button when you're adding or editing work experience, which is extremely inconvenient for someone like me who accesses my social media accounts via mobile 99% of the time. Please fix this issue and I will gladly change my review to a 5",3
2017-12-07 18:10:42,LinkedIn Premium,"A few weeks ago I received an email from LinkedIn. In summary it offered a free month trial of the Premium subscription. I thought about it for a minute and accepted. Yet, I missed the little gray print that warned that the subscription would be charged if not cancelled before the trial ends. My mistake. 
However, my point is that LinkedIn did not send a warning note to remind that the trial was about to end and a decision had to be made. Instead, they sneaked the charge through ITunes. Who would have thought! For a company that proselytize on business etiquette and correctness this is plainly hypocritical.",1
2023-08-22 22:27:14,Almost Not Worth The Premium,"I paid for premium just to see what it’s like and start reaching out to some people that I know. However, as soon as I messaged someone it stated I was “out of mail credits” which is absurd because I’d JUST paid for it. Considering how expensive the premium is, nothing should be limited. I’ve deactivated my premium since. I refuse to waste money on limitations. Otherwise, a decent app when you’re not looking for much.",3
2023-07-19 02:44:31,product and customer team unhelpful,"linkedin offer to send you job alerts AND email notifications so that you have the options to get in app alerts and emails.

i was not receiving emails and reached out to customer support who then reached out to their internal product team who claimed that if you’re received alerts in the app you won’t get emails — even though i have my email notification selected to notify me. it’s all convoluted for no reason. i should be receiving emails but i’m not and they closed my case without finding a solution",1
2023-07-03 20:49:32,Needs work,"Using the app again makes me remember why I stopped using it in the first place. The job relevance is sub par. The “promoted” postings don’t go away even after you’ve gone and hidden them and given feed back as to why they aren’t relevant and even after it states they won’t show them to you again. I’m a vet tech. Not a “technician” for anything else. I’m not a waiter, a cashier, I’ve never worked in fast food…yet I keep seeing completely UNRELATED crap in my search. Indeed is way better.",2
2022-10-21 01:00:55,App fully refreshes anytime you leave it,"This app does a pretty terrible job of caching data in RAM. Whether I’ve got one app open or ten this app rarely fails to fully reload back on the home feed every time I leave the app. 

Which means that anything I might’ve been in the middle of doing or looking at needs to be located and started all over again. It’s incredibly frustrating for an app that is quite a light app to run on an iPhone 14 Pro.",3

2020-11-13 23:58:26,What Jobs?,"As a retired military service member let me just say this was a waste of time and energy. Yea there are job posts but good luck getting a response. If you have high degrees in education then go do it. Blue collar workers, don’t waste your time. It’s like Facebook. Social media junk!!!  I’ve used this for over 2 years with not 1 not 1 job interview. Not one call back. Just more social media junk. More political b.s.  I can bet Linkdin and indeed are the same platform. Junk, junk and more junk. Thanks for wasting my time and selling my information. Whoever made this app is trash with it.",1
2020-04-11 19:53:59,Annoying notifications,"You have a good platform, but I have wanted to delete your app lately simply for the amount of absolutely ridiculous notifications. The fact that I get messages from your platform giving me tips and there’s no way to opt out is aggravating, and then notifying my when you found someone I might know? These notifications are useless and annoying and I’m sick of opening the app only to find alerts made to get me to enter the app.",3

For example, random LinkedIn users that I declined connecting with can still see my posts, they can see the identities of members that have commented on my posts. There is no way to stop strangers commenting on your posts. I experienced someone posting profane comments on my post, exposed to all of my business contacts. The only solution was to delete my posts. LinkedIn has jumped the shark. Avoid.",1

When I tried to update it stays Open (does not let me update), I select Open to go into the App, and it prompts me to update without letting me use the app, and the cycle repeats.  Basically the latest update broke the app and I cannot use it anymore.  I understand that LinkedIn (Microsoft) is always looking to enhance and improve the app, but it should not include breaking backwards compatibility and if the plan to discontinue support for a certain version of iOS - it should be clearly communicated to the user...",1
2018-07-27 15:02:50,Okay but getting worse,This app doesn’t give you the option to hide and stop the message options that keeps popping up in messaging after you send a message. Also messaging doesn’t let you delete messages before their sent and after their sent. There needs to be a way to tell if they have read the message that was sent or if it’s still been unread. Also messaging doesn’t let you delete messages. LinkedIn needs to add all of these features to the LinkedIn app to really make it more useful and a lot easier and better and useful to use.,1
2020-12-13 06:07:25,Logging in again and again,"I am also being required to log in to the app constantly, encountering problems liking posts, being told that my profile isn’t complete, not receiving notifications, etc. Hoping that this will be fixed soon - using LinkedIn on the web only isn’t acceptable in 2020.

If Science can’t stand scrutiny or challenge then it’s not fact. So, now I get ads, nothing but ads, 1 in 3 posts in my feed is from companies I despise or have absolutely no interest in. I don’t use LinkedIn to see non-stop commercials, I use it for professional networking and once in a while looking for jobs. I don’t need or want another degree, or need help with basic Excel skills (vlookups are below beginner). Just stop or I will!",1
2021-11-14 00:54:50,App never works,"Of all of the apps on my phone I don’t understand why this one literally never works. No matter where I am, majority of the time I get a blank page that says refresh at the top. No matter how many times I refresh nothing comes up. And it doesn’t matter if I have great service and WiFi the app rarely works. I’ve also tried deleting it a few times and reinstalling (because I wasn’t sure what else to do) and not even that worked. Very disappointed. Feel like we should be past broken apps these days",1

Then when you use the app they refuse to let you change the settings and say you must use the app. They also recently suffered a massive database breach. 96% off users data was compromised. They didn’t even bother telling their users about it. Instead they claim no passwords were stolen, it’s not a big deal that your name, personal information, contact information, and any other data you have given them.",1
2019-04-18 11:55:34,Premium overpriced and complicated to cancel,"Premium is $60 after the free trial. I’m aware I read cancellation procedure and made a note on my calendar. LinkedIn website sends me to Apple. Which doesn’t give me the option to cancel. Unsure how to actually speak or reach customer service, Reach out to Apple who can’t help but I must use them to cancel. Now I am stuck with a feature that is helpful but not necessary. At 1 point it turned job searching off because I didn’t respond to the borderline “spam” offers I received. Never go premium complete waste that probably won’t help you get a job.",1

With that in mind, it's an excellent resource for quality information.  In the past, I've had a premium subscription but I'm put off by the fact it doesn't include ad-free browsing and hence my feed is is still littered with ads.",4
2018-04-16 01:09:16,Searching Contacts,Love the app and use it quite often.  Would like to see one major improvement to the contact management section of the mobile app to improve in person networking.  Should be able to search your contacts by location &/or job title/function. Consider if you are traveling or move to a new city/state. Search your contacts on the mobile app by that specific location and meet up in person.,3

2023-07-07 13:25:43,Was Great until the last update,"UPDATE: the job search algorithm still hasn’t been fixed. 

The job search on this app was decent until the last update. I check the job boards for a specific career everyday. Yesterday when I checked there were over 200 new jobs posted and none of them had anything to do with the type of job I search for. What ever they did in the update screwed up the search algorithm. I hope they fix it.",2

Like the jobs have to be more specific and detailed than just the titles.",3
2021-04-27 16:19:51,Annoying Badged Notifications,"This is a great app, but the badge notifications are annoying. I cannot figure out how to disable them. Every day I have to click the app once to reset the red badges notification from 1 → 0.

The badge number is meaningless. I think LinkedIn is being deceptive and arbitrarily adding 1 badge notification every day. I know how to disable all badge notifications for LinkedIn, but I don’t want to since there are other important notifications I want to see.",2
2020-08-04 19:55:10,Please fix IPad Bugs!!!!,Great app for professional online networking! Bots and recruiters are starting to run the show unfortunately. The main reason for my review is the crazy amount of bugs for IPad users. The main one that is the most annoying is when I message people i cant click to exit out of the message and i have to close the app and restart it just to send another message. I restarted my iPad as well this isn’t on my end. Brand new iPad by the way.,3

The account management web pages for premium seem poorly done. There is not much clarity around what you can or cannot keep throughout the end of your billing period. They make it very easy to lose InMail messages that you paid them a significant amount of cash for. The combination of arbitrary limits and restrictions with poor transparency makes it feel like a swindle.",1
2018-11-05 22:05:28,Miserable user experience,"This app has essentially turned into a virus.

I need to swipe through about 20 pages of stuff I don’t want to see in order to actually begin using it. You know how when you first download an app, you get a walkthrough of the features? LinkedIn does that every single time you open the app, and there’s no way to skip over it. 

In short, it’s an absolutely miserable user experience, and I’m guessing it had to do with the fact that Microsoft now owns it. You know, the ones who forced you to download an operating system that pushes ads onto your desktop.",1
2018-09-25 20:52:36,Link not working,"I have come to rely on linkedin for my job search. And I just changed and saved the link to my profile so hiring companies and  others in my network can get to my site.

For the second time, I get a message as not being accessible which did not open up my page. This is disconcerting! What is the point of having linked in when you edit or update your link, and  success verification, only to end up not being accessible to others. 
Also, how about having a phone number for technical support? When I have specific questions, I do not have the time nor tolerance nor patience to do FAQs.
I can't get any problem resolved by a live support person in 1/4 the time I'd be going on a wild goose chase for answers!
So why is the link not working. It's the exact same link on my page as on my resume?",2

Daily news notifications must have added recently to get users to open the app more frequently.   I read and then delete the daily news notification, but have to delete that same notification again the next day.  Not sure if this is a bug or deliberate.",3
2023-08-15 14:06:57,LinkedIn Premium is far too expensive for recent grads.,I’ve been struggling to find work and got LinkedIn premium in order to assist the process and it’s way too expensive and suggests jobs that are no where near where you live. It seems like a huge waste of money and I’ll definitely be unsubscribing when I have a job but there needs to be some lower price point for recent grads just getting into the workforce. Pretty disappointed in this whole process.,2
2023-08-02 16:40:01,Gone from being a useful tool to just being tools,"How many times are you going to ask me to verify my existence despite being a user for about a decade simply because you don’t know how agencies actually work? Or are you just data gathering now? Your business model has become atrocious. Under the auspicies of “security” you are asking staff to willingly give up their privacy & it’s all done via some automated system that takes forever.

Now it only functions on Wi-Fi. Phone and OS is up to date. I have scoured the web looking for solutions and none of them work. 

This is such an inconvenience, especially when apps were created to be used on the go. Having to be tethered to a Wi-Fi connection is a no -starter. Please get together, LinkedIn developers.",1

No red fields to tell me what I’m doing wrong. In order to move on, I had to discard all the updates I made. I tried to add education, and the same issues happened. 

Not sure what could be causing this, but updating my profile is the main reason why I downloaded the App.

Another update and still no functionality for company profile management! Please work on this soon!!

I can post and communicate as a business not an individual.",1

Add labels to the messages tab in LinkedIn so people can filter messages by recruiter or former co-worker, etc.",5

If you request to see a remote job with easy apply and a certain salary it will remove the salary modifier in the search feature 99% of the time. 

You can see that a search has 27k availabilities,  but the app might show you 200.

IF YOU UPDATE, you will have lost the ability to click on a company page to see alumni from you schooling who work there and you no longer have the option to view all employees. 

Either LinkedIn is taking us all in a direction where nothing is free, or they enjoy shouting themselves in the foot and causing headaches for their developers.

LinkedIn in mainly just a bunch of people trying to sell you their services and a place for people to stroke their own egos.

I then checked my bank account and found out I was charged the full amount even thought I was told it would be free.

It lets me “report abuse”, but won’t let me hide a page that it wants to force on me. The UI has gotten better over the years, but I still really dislike the platform as a whole. I don’t follow any pages, i just have connections. It’s constantly pushing things that my connections “like” on me and won’t allow me to stop it.

LinkedIn’s only solution to make this right was to offer me the same free trial they charged me for the first time.

I'm also not loving the way my feed displays, but maybe I haven't found a magic setting yet? I want all new posts to appear first. 

Next issue—the ad bloat is pretty awful, but I guess this is just a reflection of the internet in 2020.

Also, obvious scam since almost no job posting can be applied to through this app but you are instead forced to other websites. Where you have to enter your information and set up a bra account for every job application. It’s much easier to go to the company’s website and click on careers. I get maybe one response for every 20 applications I send out. Honestly, this app makes me question the trustworthiness of Microsoft.",1
2023-04-30 17:30:15,…,I have had my account since launch and have had no success in finding a job or improving my network. I’ve taken the online courses in addition to going back to school. I have paid multiple people and companies suggested by LinkedIn only to be turned down for every job I appear to be overqualified for. Some companies tell me no after a year of applying or that they decided not to hire. Corporate America is about who you know and not what you know. There is no app to help you with that.,1
2023-03-05 07:13:47,everyone getting banned without warning or reason,Linkedin is uncalled for in their messaging analysis. You can’t openly talk about how you operate your linkedin or anything regarding hiring people to help you with messaging or anything related to that. They will ban you and have a huge unnecessary problem. They deleted my account with a billion dollar revenue company engaging with my content and they obviously don’t care. They should get sued at some point for opportunity costs with these  account terminations even post identification verification,1

I am sure many people do that.
Sometimes you see a post in the newsfeed, start reading it and then you get a text or something just moves you into another app and when you come back to LinkedIn the newsfeed is refreshing so you loose the post forever! 😁
Same thing happens even if you started writing a comment and mid comment left the app. When you come back everything you were typing is gone and the newsfeed renews again.

You should stop refreshing the newsfeed every time the user switches to another app.",4

I attempted to block out my pertinent/private information like DL number and address but they would no accept it. No customer service number, no chat support just email that takes 3-5 business days to get a response while this person is using my profile to do whatever they want.

2022-09-12 23:58:43,Give me an option to make my LinkedIn virtual resume private!,It would be great if LinkedIn adds a feature  where we can make our profile/virtual resume private within the LinkedIn. I would not like people I don't know to know everything about my work life or any future employees or my coworkers to simply look up and form a judgement before meeting me. And it will definitely prevent someone from personifying my profile. I hope LinkedIn allows users to have this feature to let them decide.,1

I find this super annoying so I’m just going to delete it and use the online version.  The other features seem to work just fine.",2

Even if I have just been “inactive” on my phone for a few minutes, I’ll return MID APPLICATION and come to find I am not even logged in anymore. Seriously annoying.",3

Luckily, all I lost was my time, but it could have been much worse. And I’m still looking for a job.

2019-05-30 13:45:15,Can’t sort newsfeed,I find it incredibly annoying that we don’t have the option to change the newsfeed sort setting to show recents first. Why am I seeing posts from 1 month ago above posts from 3 days ago???? I don’t want/need LinkedIn or other apps to tell me what’s more important for me to see first. Users should have an option to decide for themselves. Please make this update and I would use LinkedIn much more.,3
2018-12-01 21:34:57,Frustrating user experience,"Frustrations abound compared to the browser version:

- I can’t for the life of me figure out how to sort the news feed by recent.
- Assuming my last point is intentional, the sorting by top is all stuff that is weeks old vs the same sort on the desktop version. Deleting the app, etc doesn’t seem to address this nor is that a reasonable solution. 
- The header left and right menu/controls seem non-intuitive also. I don’t like to ha e to hunt and hunt for reasonable features like sorting my feed but find totally useless and never used features behind every click I try. 

Please consider addressing at least the first issue. I despise sorting by top and don’t want LinkedIn to keep insisting this upon me in mobile and reverting my selection of sort by recent on mobile.",2

Sometimes I want to post something and it makes me shorten and remove a lot of the words. Also, compress the pics to fit into your boxes and offer different layouts for posting pictures on your app!

2020-04-06 13:48:28,Please Work on Your UI/UX Design,"The network is necessary for today’s professionals, myself included. So while i will always be active on LinkedIn, it’s user interface is awful. Some improvements have been made to increase the fluidity of the experience, but so many details are left behind. 

Just for fun, try to figure out where your ‘saved items’ are, or try to update your banner or any profile settings on mobile. 

You might say “oh but Katie, you can make those changes on a desktop even though you can’t make them on mobile, so the options are still available” 

Wrong. 

Even if i update a banner on my desktop, it shows nothing on the mobile app. But it still populates in the mobile browser????

I’m a college student, and have a profile with LinkedIn. LinkedIn started sending me promotion to upgrade my account to premium which is WORTHLESS. 
Regardless, I though I would give it a try since the first month was free. Well, the last week of that month I had a surgery and couldn’t cancel my membership of $64 and they charged me. The day after, when I saw the charge, I contacted LinkedIn to try to solve this issue because as I mentioned, I am a college student and couldn’t afford, and now even less because of the surgery. 
They only offered me to cancel my subscription for future payments, but no refund whatsoever. 

$64 for a service I didn’t get a 1 single benefit is SCAM but more than that, not being able to refund the fee 1 day after payment, not understanding the situation of a student is cruel.",1

2019-12-18 18:49:16,App has spotty connection to backend,"No other app on my phone has this issue, the LinkedIn app seems to lose connection to the internet and thus the backend. This issue affects me about 80% of the time I use the app. It’s not a slowness but requests to the backend are simply failing and failing immediately. When I’m affected the issue will persist for hours up to days. If this were a website I would recommending implementing an endpoint on the backend that always returns 200 with no content. Then on app load hit this endpoint and if it fails try wiping credentials or something.",1
2019-08-29 19:49:27,Unprofessional Posts Allowed/Encouraged & Superfluous Notifcations,"Linked in has moved in the direction of Facebook instead of relevant business content, as many other reviewers pointed out. 

Their app notifications (2-6 per day) should be condensed into one summary as none of them are time sensitive and they simply boost the developer numbers for how often people open the app, that is until they get fed up and turn off notifications.",3
2018-08-07 19:07:34,Would not recommend,"Not only is there some questionable job offers on the job search part of linked in, i do not like how hard the app and the website is to navigate when trying to find help in the help center section. Also no chat or anything for help. I’m trying to figure out how to delete my account and the cancel account tab won’t even work for me. Hate to say negative things but will definitely not be using this anymore nor will I recommend it. Far easier tools to use out there",1

2023-05-15 00:02:02,Buggy job search filters,"When looking for jobs, the app won’t let me select more than one search filter at a time. This has been going on for months. If you have one search filter selected, like salary above $40,000, when you select another search filter, like entry level, the first search filter gets unselected. This applies to all search filters. There is no way I have found to get around this.",2

2022-03-18 15:48:32,People you may know,"In people you may know, when clicking on the cross to remove suggestions, it actually sends an invite! This is definitely an issue that should be fixed as soon as possible.

I also hate that they keep pushing for a resume writer. If you can’t put together an efficient resume on your own, then you’ll not be able to convince on your skills or even create your LinkedIn profile in the first place so this is non sense. Let’s have it be said.",1
2022-01-06 20:34:24,Super buggy lately,"A lot of posts no longer show a posting date. The posting date is an incredibly useful data point when I look at posts such as company press releases or individuals announcing role changes. If removing this was a conscious decision by the design team, please reconsider. Otherwise, please fix the bug causing posting date not to show!

Searching for jobs is also very buggy. A lot of text overlaps, making it annoying to scroll through job titles.",1
2021-11-16 08:49:02,Dark Mode,"So are you instructions to turn on dark mode a joke? Because I, and a lot of other people, don’t have that option in the app. Also who is responding to these reviews? A bot, PR, or a dev? Because it seems like a bot or someone who’s not allowed to actually help.

Please don’t waste your time giving that response here, you’re wasting your time - at least until Apple lets us give 0 stars.

PS. GOOD Devs say what bugs they fixed each update. They don’t copy and paste the same vague paragraph each time.",1
2018-03-08 02:35:58,Why?!?!,Every time I finish reading an article off of my feed I have to hit the “X” in the top left corner of the screen. Can you please integrate a left screen swipe so I don’t have to hit the tiny x? I usually miss the x two or three times before I get it right. I also loathe having to scroll back up a little bit to make the x reappear. Is it just me or am I doing it wrong?,4

Then, a week later I topped up my balance and immediately lost part of the money. And yet the customer service says I won't even have 30 days of Premium access from that date.

They neither gave me an option to refund, nor a full month of access. This is unfair and absoutely frustrating.",1
2020-05-01 17:58:45,Sort by- latest posts or top posts,"This app currently doesn’t have capability of sorting by the latest posts.

2020-03-18 19:15:33,Constant Notifications,"Do you enjoy constant, meaningless notifications?  This is the app for you.  Enjoy the same notification up to four times a day.  LinkedIn invites you to connect with more people, regularly, even when you don’t want to. This is a handy feature if you’re a vegetable and forgot what the app is for.  This app is a Skinner box, sans reward.

(Skip for now, skip, skip, Finish).   I have to answer the same questions over and over again.

What I mean by Skip for Now is “No!”  Would you prefer Hell no?    I just close the app as I have other things to do.",2
2019-06-19 06:58:04,Hoping to change this rating,"I hate giving 1 star rates but there’s no “give feedback to app developers” feature on this so this is the only way. I like LinkedIn, I use it to stay active in my career, etc. but this app can never save edits I make to my profile, sometimes never lets me log in, almost always says “something went wrong” on whatever I click, etc. Not sure why this occurs, my internet is speedy and every other app works perfect, it’s just this app. Hoping to change my rating if this can be resolved!!

I am not sure what version of the app because I already removed the app. I am updating this review because I received an email asking me to update the review. 

iOS 12.1.2 is my current operating system, but I cannot remember if the app problem was happening before I updated or after I updated

Fyi, I checked my requests on the desktop version, I didn't see any requests sent.

I emailed DREAM VACATIONS with my complaint and have been following up with them and the answer that I am getting is my email was forwarded to a higher up. SOCIAL MEDIA is very powerful when it comes to reviews, I am going to sit tight for a little while longer to see if I receive any response from SCOTTIE RADER ( Owner/President’s) of DREAM VACATIONS.

I get multiple notifications per day advertising things and asking me questions about people I don’t care about.

2022-02-12 20:33:12,Job search is useless,Sometime recently the job alert function changed and now I can’t find jobs to apply for. Every day I get a notification for dozens of tech jobs all over the country because they cheat the system by calling the jobs “remote”. Even after filtering out by on-site they don’t go away yet right in the job description it will say something to the effect “job requires physical location in Denver”. It’s made LinkedIn useless for finding local jobs.,1
2018-12-15 23:15:23,Great except one thing,Fix freezing issues when submitting Easy Apply and regular applications through the app. I’ll get to adding the last bit of info and then the app freezes and I have to go to my computer to redo the entire application because I’ll have to force close the app and lose all the info I’ve submitted. FIX THIS.,4
2019-06-11 15:25:24,Cannot access my account,I continually get notifications in my email asking to connect with people or telling me people are looking at at my profile.

I am so disappointed.,1

2023-10-04 05:34:05,Hopefully I can delete (2023),Hopefully I can delete this poor review and submit another one.  Currently (2023) LinkedIn mobile app is glitchy and does not work very well.  Also not receiving content from actual network like we used to.  Normally don’t write reviews but it’s unaccep and no longer recommend downloading or using on a mobile device.  Website still works well and is noticeable different.,2

They developed a beta program on their platform that allows users to write articles using AI, and they did so after I had suggested this idea to them. I have proof that they developed this beta program after my suggestion, and I also have proof that they have been taking credit for my idea without giving me credit.

2018-10-15 06:28:45,Needs Dynamic Type,"LinkedIn is a useful tool, but I have one big ongoing complaint: the app doesn’t use dynamic type.  Overall, the type is small which make the app very difficult to use for those who are visually impaired or have seen their vision diminish due to age.  I would use LinkedIn much more often if it was easier to read.",4
2021-06-20 15:51:20,Job search filters are lacking,"I’ve been trying to find a job that’s as close to possible to me, but LinkedIn likes to throw in multiple results from nearby cities. The filters don’t help with this because it’ll only list major US cities (Chicago, Phoenix, San Diego, etc) without the option to add another city.

The “Titles” filter generally has titles unrelated to the title that I searched, and the title I search would be missing from the list. 

There should be an education or requirements filter because I keep getting listings unrelated to my search that I am not qualified for yet.

Basically, the filters need work because the search is too tedious. I get plenty of results, but none are what I am looking for.",2
2020-12-18 18:20:17,Buggy,"I resisted updating the app until LinkedIn forced my hand, and it’s buggy enough that I’m probably just going to uninstall it. It never lets me interact with others’ posts anymore—read the comment, react to them, or post a comment, making the website fairly useless for me. It also keeps logging me out non-stop. If all you want is to scroll through others’ post superficially, or make your own posts, and you don’t mind logging back in all the time, this app will still work for your needs.",1

2018-01-31 23:14:25,iPad interface is clearly an afterthought,"I’d been primarily using LinkedIn on my phone, but started trying to use it more on my iPad. The experience is a joke.

There’s a huge amount of wasted screen space. Touch targets are too small and fickle. Animated transitions are janky as hell. And it doesn’t support Split View (this is a quick way to get me to spend LESS time in your app).

The iPad is a platform. iPad apps need to embrace the platform. That’s what separates a good native app from a web interface.",2
2017-12-20 21:00:54,Ok app with stale information,"The app works ok for the notifications and messaging. However the news feed is worthless. Why would anyone want to look at articles that are 5 or 10 days old? Where is the option to see the most recent information?

LinkedIn, people who are trying to find jobs use your app to just get lost and create more work. It’s useless and upsetting.

UPDATE:
1. Don’t patronize me. I didn’t bring this to your attention. LinkedIn, TikTok and others are getting roasted in the press over this form of privacy intrusion.
2. Quoting Erran Berger’s party line response is BS. Vague enough to quiet the mob but totally disingenuous.
3. Given that LI has a history of sneakily stealing contact addresses, you have zero credibility.

Why would LinkedIn need to perform an “equality check” when the app is not in the foreground? Huh? Why perform an equality check PERIOD? If a user doesn’t paste a clipboard item, why validate that the clipboard is equal to inputted text?

This is grounds for a nice juicy class action suit.",1

2020-09-07 11:46:45,App feed is not good,You miss lots of opportunities because the app keeps showing the same posts from days or weeks old instead of the new posts. It doesn’t give you an option to set the recent posts like the laptop does. That needs to be fixed. People pay for this service and lots of money for it. Least you can do is update that issue!!,3
2020-07-17 11:29:40,Resets when you come back!,"One of the purposes of this app is to find jobs and apply for them.  When you are applying, you have to go back and forth between apps on your phone to gather files and information.  When you go back to LinkedIn app, it is reset back to the homepage, kicking you off the application, and you have to start over.  Very inconvenient!!",3
2020-05-24 17:15:06,App launches from safari PLEASE  FIX,"App launches automatically and randomly from Safari if active tab is on LinkedIn mobile site.  Assume this is happening when checking if the iOS App is installed.  Should  only launch when selected by user.  iOS version 13.4.1

The iOS app should not launch by itself.  And relaunches after closing the app.  There is some communication between safari and the app that is broken.

Can send a screen recording.",2
2019-11-27 01:15:24,Yikes,"The app gets two stars for two reasons. 

1. Premium didn’t help in my job search and it’s expensive.
I used three apps to job search: LinkedIn, Indeed, and Zip Recruiter and each one had the same job application materials. I got a lot of interviews with Indeed, a fair amount with Zip Recruiter, and zero (!) with LinkedIn Premium. I ended up with a good attorney job using Indeed. 

2. LinkedIn has become more Facebook-y

LinkedIn used to have some level of professional demeanor on its feed. Now my feed is filled with “I am oh so honored to be using the toilet at the Bank of America Building and beginning this new chapter of my life”. It’s corny and it makes me not want to use the app. If you want business or niche professional news just subscribe to Axios.",2
2019-08-14 20:24:19,Feed view,"Is it that hard to organize the feed in chronological order? The main function of this is to find jobs and be able to network with people.  It doesn’t help that just now I see a job fair or an opening from TWO WEEKS ago.  I log in to the app every day, a few times a day.  We also need a “see less” or mute/hide option for connectios that like/react/share to too many articles.",2

2019-05-07 08:26:00,Terrible app,"I’d love to meet the decision maker who thought that being unable to sort your feed was a good idea. I constantly see 2 week old posts; even things I’ve already engaged with. Why? 

Some of the same formatting issues that ruin the website on the iPad plague the mobile app, which leads me to believe that this “app” is really just a badly packaged browser front end. 

I want to like LinkedIn, but it seems that LinkedIn still hasn’t figured out what it wants to be, or how to really be anything.",1
2019-03-04 17:23:00,Poor Functionality,"Many issues and bugs such as not being able to truly optimize your time line. I’ve hidden the same people multiple times and every time I log in I see their content front and center.

I know every time I get on LI, my most recent feeds are not from three days ago or seven or whatever it always says after I refresh. Is there no way you can make news feed that is current come up?

When I search for a specific job title, I have to scroll through 50 or so promoted jobs that have absolutely no relation to the job I specifically searched for. After scrolling through unrelated jobs for 10 minutes, I get one or two jobs that I was actually looking for, and then 50 more promoted ones.",2
2023-03-31 00:45:46,Overall,"Overall, this is a great app. But LinkedIn needs to give an option to its users about hiding the activity of its members. I personally don’t want my connections to see posts that I’ve liked. It would be nice to be able to choose/hide it from followers.",4

It says it will take 48 hours. It has been 8 days. There is no email address nor phone number for LinkedIn. I cannot get updates because I cannot log on. I cannot send any messages to LinkedIn because I cannot log on. I cannot contact support for premium members because I cannot log on.,1
2023-04-20 23:07:12,Something real classist/elitist about this platform,"Why is this advertised as a great way to network and find new opportunity?

This platform only cares about appearance and not about actual skills. It only resulted in one actual job that was as a measly barista/server for a very mean and racist company.

Everyone just wants to be successful why there have to be so many barriers and obstacles for people who are so called “different”?",2

2023-02-12 22:37:13,Buggy,"Scrolling on the phone locks up almost every other scroll. Also you can’t leave the app for one second without it jumping back to the home page. This is very disruptive and makes the app hard to use. Also searching for an intern job immediately shows you senior positions, which makes searching useless. Also the tag of “entry level” will be on senior positions, and director level will be under “mid level.” It’s a mess.",1
2023-02-08 16:17:26,Random idea for you all - Please consider,"I love LinkedIn. I’m trying to replace my scrolling on social media with scrolling LinkedIn. I was thinking - why not implement a discover page sort of thing where you can find new ideas other than who you are connected with. Make it controlled enough so it’s not just a bunch of useless nonsense like instagram or tiktok. If you need some help developing, I’m graduating with a marketing degree in May and would be honored to be part of the team ;)",1
2022-08-18 17:52:02,App is OK - but limited,LinkedIn would be so much better if there were just a couple of feed settings. Why users can't opt out of seeing what our connections have liked or commented on is silly. I am completely disinterested in having my feed be dominated by seeing posts/updates from people/organizations I am not familiar with just because a connection hit like or made a one-word comment.,2
2021-08-11 01:56:43,Needs Improvement - Erase Racist People,"LinkedIn is a decent platform to use. However, LinkedIn is full of racist people who don’t seem to be banned for some reason.

Even Facebook posts are not made this public while it’s supposed to be more casual and LinkedIn is supposedly to be professional.

I know I can turn off notifications but I do want some, and it seems like every time I turn one notification off, the app just sends more of the other types.",2
2021-06-24 18:20:40,Totally Confused,"I thought I had the linked in app. A job app indicated I needed to buy an upgraded linked in app to speak with the recruited. When I clicked to do so, there was no way to activate that happening. I’m old school and my argument is that unless you are a millennial, you can’t figure out how to use this computer stuff. If it was that good, anyone could use it. 

I can drive any car but can only use some of these computer programs. Therefore one customer lost.

2021-04-27 16:54:33,Stop prompting us for update,"LinkedIn, here’s a tip—if a user wants to update their app, they will go to the App Store and do that.

Currently, if you aren’t using the latest app version, this app will force you to select “update” or “not now” constantly. It doesn’t save your selection and prompts every single time you switch back to the app. This is not only happening after closing the app and reopening—it will actually prompt when simply switching apps. This is horrendous UX.",1
2021-02-15 01:41:10,"This app is meant for spying, staff is shady","1st off, Microsoft owns LinkedIn. They are collecting and selling your information.

LinkedIn actually committed the same spying as tiktok and they’ve had breeches of information in the past. Microsoft has also been hacked multiple times.

2nd There’s a lot of things this app doesn’t do right and yet it pries into your phone, unnecessarily.

Like posting and reposting doesn’t work.

They try to force you to have by using “stories” as a app only function. No one really looks at stories.

This app unnecessarily collect and stores picture.

They try to make using it via browser difficult so you go to the app.

2020-08-06 20:04:45,Going downhill,"I think it’s awful that now you have to pay just to message someone. This is supposed to be a networking app and I believe you’re just too greedy. It’s one thing to offer premium features but to cut off all connections through messaging unless you pay- that’s ridiculous. It’s not like anyone is profiting off of it besides you and you’re using your customers ina reproachable manner especially during COVID is reprehensible. It is just not cool at all! Shame on you LinkedIn or should I say, LinkeDONE.",1
2020-06-24 22:57:23,Contact theft,"I’m sure this is old news, but back on February 13th 2019 when LinkedIn updated its terms of service, it also imported the contact list from my phone. Now when I find out, while using the latest version of the app,it won’t let me remove my contacts, claiming it can only be done on the app. Pure Avarice on the part of LinkedIn .

No other app has this issue on my phone. I deleted the app and reinstalled it and it still has this issue. Also, the platform has changed so wildly that it’s no longer helpful in connecting professionals. You cannot easily upload a resume anymore. You have to manually type everything and try to make it fit. Terrible.",1

I’ve completely filled out my profile, listed several job titles, given location preferences but the job listings recommended are never applicable.

To me it’s awful-can’t see a place to post, messages don’t work at all, and the app lags. My suggestion to developers: when you want to post that should be one of the plus sign categories.

For a site that demands so much to join you would think they might have an actual process to go through to unrestrict an account.  Very dissatisfying to say the least.",1

If I delete one of your “recommendations” once, that means I don’t want to connect with the person or subscribe to the link, newsletter or hashtag. Got it?

Additionally, it lacks a fair amount of features that the website offers, such as seeing most recent post first. It’s frustrating when a majority of the post a 3 weeks old, I’d rather see most recent post in my feed.",3
2023-08-23 01:50:39,App needs a feature update,I’m not sure why an app such as this has not adapted the ability to allow the timeline to be organized by “most recent”.  The web version offers it.  Why not the app?  Let’s get this feature implemented LinkedIn UX team.,4

I have clicked apply for some jobs and it takes me to the job posting for some companies and then everything freezes until the app crashes. Way to go, LinkedIn! I’ve contacted their social media team about this, and whomever responded to my inquiry about trying to fix this isn’t very good at her job. Nothing like asking me everything that I’ve already said and volunteered. 👎🏻

My top five are all greater than a week old.  Just absolutely completely useless.  I want to see what’s new NOW.  Not some post from 2 weeks ago I’ve already seen.  Pathetic.

Apps with features that don’t work, or don’t work right, are frustrating.  Especially when you trust that the updates you made have actually been made.  It was not obvious, either, that the updates had not ‘taken’, even though no error was received at the end.

2022-11-05 15:31:43,Algorithmic Catastrophe,Meta’s mobile application for Linkedin almost mirrors Facebook in almost every terrible way - where the algorithm’s recommended posts show things you have already seen and continue to see for a week or more. The amount of suggested content and lack of relevancy is overwhelming.

2021-01-11 19:12:15,Censorship,LinkedIn is a powerful business tool. I have used it very successfully to expand my network. BUT they have a tendency to restrict your account with no warning meaning that you have no access to the massive amount of connections and data on the platform. There is NO ONE to talk to when that happens. You are totally at their mercy. You get no warning beforehand either. So definitely keep all important contact information in your own files.,1

2021-09-01 15:50:43,Bugs not fixed yet?,"“When you’re in a conversation, speed and stability matter.” “This update features bug fixes.“
They have been posting the exact same thing with every update for the past few years. 
One might think by now the bugs had been fixed and the app was speedy and stable. Apparently it isn’t.",2
2021-04-29 20:59:28,Stop sending me useless notifications,No matter what I do the app constantly will show a red 1 for a notification even if I’ve turned everything off. It’s super annoying I’m tired of clicking into the app only to clear some nonsense. They are falsely boosting their user engagement by having false and useless notifications. Stick to helping people in their business careers and not promoting political nonsense and false user activity.,1
2020-12-14 11:58:09,Annoyed,"This new update is not good. I keep getting logged off; sometimes it is between sessions or if I leave the app and try to open it again. Luckily, I have my password saved on my device, so logging in isn’t a big hassle. Hope this is fixed soon, everything was working well before this past weekend!",3
2020-12-13 05:07:04,Rollback your update or fix it,Come on LinkedIn you need to do better. The app makes me login every time I open it and sometimes it even logs me out while I’m using it. When I hit the back button it takes me to the login screen. Ridiculous. I didn’t see anything mind blowing with whatever update you just pushed so you mine as well rollback to whatever you had before since you haven’t seemed to be able to fix this in a timely manner.,1
2020-11-24 12:11:30,Display issues make it unusable on any iPhone with a notch.,"I have now tested the app on iPhone X and iPhone 12 Pro Max. The full UI does not display on these phones and makes navigation impossible. The back arrow is not accessible, meaning I have to fully kill and restart the app just to get out of certain screens. There is no search bar, and no way to get to Settings. How could Microsoft release this app like this?",2
2019-07-06 12:12:56,Applied Jobs don’t show,I’ve applied for two jobs through LinkedIn and neither show in the “applied jobs” section. This is frustrating Bc it would be a great way to stay organized in one app but it doesn’t work. Yes I used LinkedIn to apply. All through the app and nothing.,4

1) REDUCE CLICKS TO FIND JOBS YOU’VE ALREADY SAVED
Why is access to this buried in going through my profile, to “saved items”, to jobs? Why is there no access front the Jobs page?

2) IMPROVE YOUR FILTERS!!!
Please learn from Zappos’ excellent filter and search functionality and add some of their features, to help users have more appropriate content in their alerts and searches: 

a) ability to exclude results using “not” or “I don’t want.”

b) FUNCTIONING filters (for example, your current industry filters do not work properly).

c) more clear and intuitive saved search criteria/editing. For the pro version, please add more criteria for indicating job search parameters to recruiters.

d) ability to create compound search criteria.",1
2019-11-10 15:06:38,Password reset,I have tried several times to reset my password because the original password I used is invalid. When they sent me a link to reset my password it requested  that  I use my current one. My current one and the only one that I use is somehow invalid. Don’t you all send a temporary one or a link to just create a new password.,3
2019-08-16 03:47:39,Doesn’t follow modern app standards,I’m constantly confused as to why there aren’t more swipe gestures implemented in this app. I’d really like to be able to dismiss profile previews by swiping down. I also don’t want the connection request confirmation to show at the top of the screen with no way to dismiss. Navigation needs a lot of updating to conform to modern standards.,3

2023-09-06 18:45:55,Terrible left wing trash app,"Never mind this is a far left tech company that frequently deletes posts.  I can’t tell you how many times I’ve received important responses to my messages without any notification at all.  I cannot put into word how much I hate LinkedIn as a paid user of their recruiter tool.  I’m not sure what’s worse, the fact they force their politics on users, or their app being buggy and unreliable.",1
2023-07-06 20:03:23,Doesn’t warn you with any notifications before it starts charging when free trial ends,"Doesn’t warn you with any notifications before it starts charging when free trial ends. 
This is critical because it states that you must cancel the subscription a day before the free trial ends. So cancel at any time does not help you with a refund. And if you want a refund you cannot request a refund on the app and you must login on a desktop. Really?",1
2022-10-28 14:18:58,Garbage feed algorithm,"LinkedIn should be a useful website. But the inability to customize one’s Feed — driven, I suspect, by a desire to push advertising — means that I either have to scroll through a garbage algorithm that serves me weeks-old content or switch to most recent and scroll through every single one of my connections’ little emoji reactions and comments. Let us customize what types of posts we see in your feed.",1
2022-01-10 15:19:55,Saved Items,While the app makes it really simple to save items to read later it feels near impossible to find those in the app itself.  Please update the app to make those easier to find.  The website itself is simple but the app is horrible for that.,3
2022-01-08 03:16:30,Can’t upload profile picture,After a recent download can’t upload a profile picture. Even decided to delete the app and tried again same thing there’s a little glitch in it it freezes when you try to do so.,3
2021-09-09 21:12:05,ios version support,"The ridiculous fact is some phones now don’t support highest ios update versions. And with each update, the apple makes iPhone run much much slower than before so that you’d have to buy newer phones from them!
And considering all these, the developers of linkedin still decide to publish updates which only supports ios 13.
Making every single older phone or everyone who don’t want to install ios updates, unable to use the app for good.

i believe this is serious criticism for the devs to face, and i hope they reconsider the policy into a right one.

**Learn a bit from “Telegram”, they never expire an app version or limit the OS version compatibility at all...!**",1
2019-07-03 17:44:45,Great resource,It’s really nice having a place that integrates networking with job searches and interesting links. This is to a professional what reddit is to a young adult.

Click on the Update button and it takes me to the App Store. With no delay, I get the Open button which takes me back to the program where the Update button again appears. Lather, rinse, repeat. It never updates and I never get an opt out choice. The LinkedIn app is no longer functional on my iPad.",1
2019-12-16 13:37:48,Really bad idea,"App worked fine.  Now, it's forcing me to update, but the new version isn't compatible.  Oooops!  Your bad!  You should have checked beforehand.  Oooops!  Now I can't use the current version that works just fine because your forced upgrade message won't go away.  Oooops.  You've irritated a paying customer.  Ooooops, you made a bad business decision.

I will cancel my premium membership.  Don't wish to fund such a bad idea.  Free is a good price for this level of incompetence.

2019-06-03 21:14:53,Miss the old LinkedIn jobs app,"The now discontinued jobs app was very efficient and labeled jobs you viewed as “viewed” so you could quickly see which jobs were new.  

With the now forced usage on the regular LinkedIn app, you can’t tell which jobs you have already viewed and when you do save a job the saved notification wades time as it blocks the icon for previous page. 

Jobs functionality needs to mimic the previous jobs app.",1
2019-05-14 15:25:58,Slow and no split screen on iPad Pro,The app is slower than the website on my iPad Pro. It also hijacks the entire screen and doesn’t support the split screen view. Other apps work just fine. It would be nice that instead of just updating the app to “be more reliable than ever” you update it to support modern workflow features to improve the time it takes for us to get work done.,2

It’s a scam. They want u to pay $60 a month to do so. My account was the free version and I guess I used it too much.

It’s ridiculous.

And the ones you can supposedly control don’t actually “stick”, so you still get notifications you’ve asked not to get...

The obvious counter to that is ""then you wouldn't scroll through all our sponsored ads"". Which leads to my next issue...

2018-01-17 03:02:00,Constant crashing,"This app would be fantastic if it didn’t keep crashing, so you have to sign in, and do the captcha over and over after being logged in just 20-40sec. I’ve restarted my phone.l several times. Uninstalled, reinstalled, restarted my phone again. Nothing works. Guess I’ll stick to a web browser.",3
2017-12-14 22:17:02,Good App Done Right,Am enjoying the app. It’s gives me the information I need and makes it easy to use. I do not explore LinkedIn here. Just consume information that is pushed to me. The exploring the research and the list building I do off my Desktop.,5
2017-11-03 02:22:17,Great for business!,This app is great to meet people. To find new jobs or even just expand on your current job. You can talk to people who work at the same place as you or even people who have a related job. Very good app!,5

2023-09-26 18:40:27,Annoying.,"Works well for its main purpose, but the app is constantly coming up with ways to send me new notifications even though I have them all disabled. It’s a huge turnoff and makes me want to delete the app and just use their desktop version.",3

2022-12-27 21:19:49,Algorithm is terrible,"It’s almost useless to check you feed on the app as most of what they push is a week or more old. It’s befuddling that you don’t have the option of displaying Recent posts.
As a company LinkedIn seems to have made no improvements or updates for years (certainly not since Microsoft acquired it).",2
2022-12-02 21:59:34,Delete the Discover button,The app replaces the “Connections” button with a “Discover” button and now I cannot easily access my connections. When I deleted the app and reinstalled it I had access to my connections for about a day and then I was stuck with the Discover button again. Please delete the Discover button.,2
2021-11-11 01:17:15,Changes in New Version Annoying,"Recent update now requires you to put in the month for you your work start and end dates.  I used to just put in the years, which worked well. Plus, I don’t remember what month I started 20 years+ ago! And I shouldn’t be forced to put the exact date on a social profile. Can you PLEASE put things back the way they were before? Thank you.",1
2021-09-06 09:41:33,Not friendly,"1. Not working in iOS12. It is not a rocket science and there is no any high-load technology as video streaming or anything else inside. This basic functionality could be running on a brick
2. Not working in Russia unless you use VPN. While every single app already implement very basic ways to overcome restrictions and censorship, this developers just choose the easiest track: not working- not our problem.",1
2020-12-16 17:33:45,New Update is a Headache,"For the past week or so I have to log in every time I open the app. My post reactions and comments aren’t working and I can’t click on people/company profiles from posts. My search and save features work sporadically. As someone who uses LI a ton for work, this is frustrating. So far, the web app works just fine, but I’m not always on my laptop and accessing LI from my phone via chrome or safari is not a great experience.",1
2020-06-02 01:29:28,Dark mode?,"Hey LinkedIn developers, I never leave reviews but I greatly appreciate the app and how it’s helped me further my career. Could you guys add dark mode capability? I think it would help our eyes, especially with being on tech 24/7 right now.",5

2020-05-27 05:37:11,Functions like Feed Sort not available,"App functionality compared to web version is lacking. For example, I would like to be able to sort my feed by date instead of having stale posts appear on top. Please allow this function on the app, not just online.",3
2019-12-04 22:34:32,Big Issues with the Colors of the profile pictures,"Consistent issues with colors of the profile pictures changing. And then certain ones won’t have the issue but since this is a business platform, I am limited on what pictures to use. Needs an immediate fix.",3
2023-07-28 14:27:29,App update idea,"Just a thought, LinkedIn could add a feature of like but not like exactly, but more like an option for cfbr instead of cfbr.. like you would react to the post but not like it, instead react for better reach kinda thing",4
2019-05-07 17:24:17,Want to Upload All Your Contacts???,"The LinkedIn app is a minefield of prompts to upload all your contacts. Sorry, but I don’t want to see what my exes, telemarketers and all the other contacts in my phone are up to. Today I opened the app to connect with someone and was promoted twice, in two different ways, to upload all my contacts. There’s no way to turn it off and it’s really annoying.

If it weren’t for that, I’d give the app 4 or 5 stars.",1
2018-12-19 19:58:23,Great idea terrible platform,I like the idea and connection of Linked In but the platform feels archaic. It’s terribly hard to navigate around on and the messaging system feels like dial up. How can you view your own profile as others do? Time to invest into building the site for more users. Users who are use to instant connection and don’t have to pay 50 bucks a month for it.,2
2018-04-30 20:40:18,Can’t attach a file,It’s kind of ridiculous that I can’t attach a file at all in the messages. It only gives me the option for photos and to mention other LinkedIn users. Then when I try to go to the site on safari because I can actually send files on the desktop site it just directs me to the app. I have literally use the hotspot on my phone to then connect my laptop so I can send a resume. Great website awful app!!,1
2018-04-24 20:26:45,Beware!!!!!,"After a long hiatus from this App I reloaded it and updated my account.

After allowing LinkedIn to share my information (hoping to find a new job in my field) I have been getting 6-10 robocalls a day from shady companies not even close to my field. One even was trying to claim I had debt with him (outright lies)!

So if you want an unending stream of sales calls go ahead and let LinkedIn make money off you by selling your info to the highest bidder.",1

2023-10-04 15:01:00,Premium is web only,"Giving this app only 2 stars because you cannot manage or even view your Premium subscription information from the app. It’ll tell you that it is optimized for Desktop but in reality is because LinkedIn doesn’t want to share any fees with Apple. Ok, so I’ll go CANCEL this overpriced membership on the web.",2
2022-09-30 23:23:06,Locked Out,The new security feature created some issues for a couple of days but between customer service and googling what to do I was able to login again.,4
2023-06-29 15:24:46,LinkedIn is the worst,I purchased a new phone and I wanted to log into my LinkedIn account but it keeps telling me that my account is suspended. I sent a message to LinkedIn to do an investigation they came back with it have suspended my account because of my activities and now I am unable to log in. The only thing I use the app for is to look for job and congratulations some of my friends.,1
2023-06-24 03:38:16,Does this app even work properly?!,"I have found that for awhile now I can’t seem to view my own profile. When I press on my icon a side menu slides out from the left. But non of the buttons work. I can’t access my own profile, pages, groups, events and settings.

What is happening here?
Please fix. Thank you!",2
2022-10-27 21:44:18,Constant refreshing,"I could be midway through an application and need to get off of the screen for a second to get some information. When I come back, LinkedIn refreshes and I lose the application and basically everything. I’ve decided not to apply for jobs on LinkedIn anymore.. just use it to find out what jobs are hiring, then go directly to their career website.",1
2022-07-01 16:21:40,Version challenges,"When using the app or logging in from an iPhone does not allow me to publish articles. That’s frustrating because, like right now, I have one copied to my memory, and can’t post it to my community.

2022-09-13 18:18:57,Headline won’t save,"No matter how many times I try, the app will not save my headline that reflects my new employer! Keeps having a pop up that says “something went wrong. Please try again”. Both my current and former employers are not liking this. Who can fix this for me? The Help section just shows how it is supposed to work. Frustrated!!!",2
2022-09-04 13:18:07,Another Facebook,"They have taken away all the analytics in the last two months.  It is not even worth posting as you can only see 100 users information on a 40k post!  You can’t see people, employers, etc.  They charge premium for services they now have a work around!  They haven’t grown other than to be more like Facebook and as Serina would say I’m evolving away from LinkedIn!",1
2022-06-12 17:47:02,Updates all the timeeeeeee,There’s an update every other day and for what? That’s why it’s crashing on ppl. You open it and it says “something went wrong” and the only reason it’s doing that is becausssssse there’s an update. It would be nice if an update lasted longer than a week.,3
2021-07-06 03:15:24,Personalized invite is never an option,"Personalized invite is never an option on my phone, after networking with people, I feel guilty at being mannerless because I used the app to connect with that individual. I can invite only from laptop, not from the app.",3
2022-04-17 04:23:50,Finding saved content is a nightmare,It is entirely way too difficult to find saved posts (same is true in the web actually). Saved items should be accessible from the menu that appears when clicking on our profile photos.,2
2021-09-10 19:00:20,Don’t Force the Updates,"I have no problem if you want to send a reminder pop up that there’s an update available. However, when I click on a notification I don’t want to be stuck on a screen that forces me to update before I can do anything. This was not a convenient time for me to update. I should be able to update at my convenience not be forced into it.",1
2021-07-21 01:38:44,Bait & switch app,"Tried to reach out to a contact not in my contact list. In order to send them a message a pop-up window indicated I needed to download the LinkedIn app, which I then did. When I then tried to send them a message another pop up window came up and said I could only do it with their premium functionality for $59. This is a ridiculous app not worth your time or effort",1
2020-12-31 03:02:30,No value provided - harvests too much personal data,"Ready to delete because it is so manipulative and doesn’t help with anything. I only got this because of airBnB but otherwise it’s worthless. It tries to coerce you into opening it, downloading worthless updates. 

With the release of iOS 14, it is clear that LinkedIn is collecting way too much data. They don’t need this info to provide their so-called service. What a dishonest, disgusting organization.",1
2020-03-08 17:30:19,Link !,You app is involved with harassing me bulling cursing and discrimination so I going turn you just like Mixer and Reddit and how the used your app and Microsoft’s products threaten my Family I’m going sue all of you !

2020-12-10 12:52:00,Constantly Logged Out,"The LinkedIn app provides me with the info needed on a daily basis to continually improve my career.

Please fix this issue or provide instructions to prevent this from occurring ASAP.",3
2020-12-07 02:06:30,December IPhone App Performance Issues,It’s obvious that their are severe performance issues with the App since the most recent update including getting logged out repeatedly and App failing to load new content. Yet LinkedIn is not providing any useful communication to user community about how to resolve this or when it will be resolved. Very frustrating and App is virtually unusable. UAT on this update must have been non-existent. Better should be expected of Microsoft for sure.,1
2020-11-16 08:32:31,Business purpose; not Facebook,"Please do some content moderating.  Lately my feed looks like Facebook with posts about people’s political preference, happy anniversary to my wife, prayers, pictures of kids and pets.  No recipes yet, but I’m sure that’s next!  LinkedIn was a place for business, with business related posts.  Could we please get back to that?",3
2020-05-06 02:06:24,The banner does not show while using app,Working on this for quite a while with LinkedIn customer service. They are not able to fix it. I dont want to write everything down here. They already know. I really wish there was an alternative app which would let professionals and companies connect efficiently. Thanks.,2
2020-03-24 18:31:25,Bad for job application,"I use the website when I’m on the computer and LinkedIn in fairly easy to use. However the app is totally different; while it caries over the information form my profile, when I attempt to apply to a posted job all the app does is go to an unrelated page and doesn’t allow you to app. The only work around is to save the job then get on the computer when you can to apply.",1
2017-12-15 03:47:11,Can't live without it.,Professional opportunities abound on LinkedIn. Having this app is critical to being notified immediately when they pop up so you're not responding days or week later.,5
2019-12-12 23:57:22,Rearranging Certifications,For some reason LinkedIn has taken away the users ability to rearrange their certifications. The way LinkedIn displays them may not always align with which certifications are the best/most useful/most relevant for a specific user. I feel like it should give you the option to decide which initial 3 are displayed.,3
2019-11-10 22:49:25,This app used to be good. It is the worst now.,"Pop ups all the time after every single action in the app. And annoying users by showing a pop up to buy linkedin premium every time after you “easy apply” for a job  is just cheap. If we wanted the premium, we would get the premium.

In my eyes, LinkedIn is literally trying to bully people into buying the premium by annoying users with the pop ups. Shame on you.",1
2019-06-01 21:49:22,Uploading Resume,"Before the update, you were able to upload your resume to your profile by the command to upload media. Now when you choose it (to upload it) it only allows you to do a photo. Does that mean I have to screenshot my resume? I used to be able to upload a Word doc.",3
2019-04-25 23:58:48,Videos & Images Don’t Load,"The last two updates have botched this app.  I can see images and videos for a split second while I’m scrolling, but as soon as I stop to watch a video it goes black.  If I open the post I just get a spinning wheel.  I know it’s not my WiFi or cellular connections.  Has to be the app.  I haven’t bothered opening other than to see if it’s corrected.  Not a real loss because LinkedIn is less about business now anyway.",1
2019-03-22 10:46:22,App freezes,"For such a big name you have the worst application I’ve ever seen, it has been so long and you guys haven’t fixed this issue. Every time i open the application it would freeze after scrolling couple of posts. It’s not like it happens once in a while, it would do the same all day long. 
If you guys don’t have efficient developers then use your own platform to find some one who can fix this issue.",1
2018-10-31 01:35:53,STOP with the Sponsored Inbox posts!!,"This app was okay but now it's taken a completely scummy turn! I noticed a notification in my inbox on LinkedIn and when I went to check I found it was a ""sponsored"" message. The message was some trash article I don't care about and in order to get rid of that notification I had to open the message and go in to delete t. Talk about a waste of time and an invasion of ads into my inbox, what a new low!!",1
2018-09-12 17:20:57,New Update?,"I’ve used Linkedin happily for awhile but as of a few days ago, its been quite glitchy. It keeps signing me out every so often, asking me to prove that I’m not a bot-both on my ipad and iphone. Another, some links aren’t responsive when clicked. 

It’s quite frustrating especially since there were times I had a lengthy note typed out, only to disappear after being signed out... Poor user experience. Please fix.",1
2018-06-07 13:41:14,Customer service,"You have created a fine product and successfully taken it to market through crowd funding but you have not supported your customers.

2018-03-26 12:51:35,Good function but annoying UI,"I am using an IPhone X and still find the top news, search bar, and share bar at the top annoying whenever I scroll up it pulls down blocking the top 25% of the screen. Also, some of the app utilized swipe to go back while other parts require hitting a back button. Small details, but the inconsistency is detracting from the content.",2
2018-01-10 22:34:11,Because it’s not professional,"I’m writing this review because Linkedin has started asking users to review their site internally and not show it to the public through the App Store. 

This mobile site is the more of a Facebook page then actually wanting to network with professionals.  I’m surprised I don’t have to watch a commercial before I access the site. The premium site is little to useless giving data that isn’t needed. Why don’t I have the same options on the mobile site as the desktop, how long has it been?

Stick to the basics. Show who is in your network. That’s it. Stop asking for my contacts and my Facebook. 

Thank you,

Brent",2

2017-11-16 13:13:58,Smooth interface,"The user experience is great, the app directly correlates with the desktop version (no overtly glaring differences between mobile and computer) and the richness of graphics and article loads is great. Love the app and the service.",5
2017-10-30 21:25:01,By far the best app for professionals,I can't emphasize the importance and I got my present job because of your platform I will never forget it because of the numerous connections and opportunities LinkedIn has provided to me in every level or my career.,5

Become more like Truth Social, and less like darpa fbook.",1
2022-06-06 17:17:15,LinkedIn access,I have an iPhone 6S and am very satisfied with it. Linked in newest version requires 13.0 and my antique won’t accept that version. So when I open the app from my on screen icon I am asked to download this 13.0 but mine won’t I can’t access LinkedIn. I guess the only option I have is to delete linked in and explore other options. Shame. I used to really enjoy this platform. 👎🏼,1
2022-05-16 09:42:21,Not Working,"For the past few months, LinkedIn has consistently failed to load correctly. I end up having to delete the app and reinstall to get it to work. This lasts for 1-3 days, then I have to do it again. Please fix! Others than this issue, I love LinkedIn. Thanks!",3

I obviously don’t mind being notified of some things like comments, follows, etc. but all the other junk is very annoying",1
2022-02-01 23:38:25,"Slow, crappy platform",The app is so glitchy and the filters don’t even work. I filtered on entry level jobs and was getting jobs for managers. It seems companies manipulate the filters and it’s not like you can report them accurately. You can report a job posting but there are no options for “inaccurate information.” They need to revamp the entire platform and sped it up.,1

This issue becoming frustrating.

My phone is updated, the app is updated, yet the problem still exist.

I’m trying to put end dates on projects that have completed and it won’t apply them.  Its keeps it as an active open project... This is misleading to potential customers as they think 1.) I am lazy and not updating my projects 2.) The project is in trouble because its taking so long to complete.... either way its bad and needs to get the bug fixed asap!,1

The person who hacked me put their phone number and it has been a crap show from LinkedIn Help Center… They have told me my ID doesn’t match, have simply attempted the two factor authorization, legit send me an email to delete the account which requires access that I do not have… you get the drift.

At this point someone on LinkedIn has my identity (photo, resume, etc) but changed their name and added their phone number to ensure no access.

2022-10-11 17:19:56,Why does it reset so often?,"I need to switch between apps when using LinkedIn - LinkedIn simply does not have all the information I need so I switch to other apps to enter info into LinkedIn. The app refreshes and restarts too frequently to make the app useful. I find myself getting annoyed with the app, as the frequent resets are unnecessary. It’s a career oriented app, why do I need to be abreast of the latest info?",1
2022-07-09 09:16:56,Please Fix!,Don’t know if the developer is aware but the search and chat function that is at the very top of the screen is covered up by the OS time and battery bar on my  iPhone XR.

2020-05-10 04:56:03,Job Requirements,"This app is fantastic for networking, and can really give anyone seeking employment the opportunity to score a career.

I’d love to see the option to look up something like “bachelor’s of science in chemistry” or whatever relevant coursework and then find jobs that specifically require that.

2020-07-11 01:52:51,Useful Information After the Fact,I’m not going to need the iOS app until they add the basic functionality of sorting by date. I see things that I might have found useful the date it was posted days/ weeks after it was posted and see the same information that was posted again later in browsing for no apparent reason. It’s not a useful source of news right now.,1
2020-07-03 15:48:08,Just another Facebook,"This app is full of people posting memes, arguing in comments about politics, and is now notifying of posts about how everything is racist in America.

The same task has to be repeated several times before the update goes through... This app is great, but it has been falling behind most likely due to cost cutting which has affected its QA/QC Standards. What a wast... what a shame!",2

I cannot close my account because I am still a premium member. Even though I didn’t pay for it pass the trial. 

So either premium profiles are actually free so you don’t need to pay for them. 
 
Of course since I got and cancelled the trial via iTunes subscription, I can’t cancel my account. Any time I try I get to a page to cancel an already cancelled subscription. 

Why do I want to delete my account? I get far too many “jobs you may be interested in” emails. Jobs that I’m not even qualified for. Medical Assistant ≠ Registered Nurse or Emergency Medical Tech. I unsubscribed from the mail and changed the settings.

Never happened . Finally deleting it today. So ridiculous for major networking app.",1

“fix “anything because I  used to be able to press a persons email and that would be a hyperlink now you can’t do that any longer which makes it much more cumbersome... now you have to copy and paste

When I’ve TURNED OFF all notifications except messages and new connections. Like “message this new connection,” “see these jobs.” It’s very infuriating.",2
2021-03-22 04:21:50,‘No internet connection’ error,I always get a no internet connection while using the app. My internet is fine with everything else. This is purely a LinkedIn app issue.

We have canceled this several times and it keeps happening. This needs to stop. We can’t afford to keep having money unexpectedly taken from our account. I would recommend anyone be VERY careful about signing up for their additional services.,1
2019-05-31 00:19:12,LINKEDIN PIRATED MY CONTACT LIST,I just received a very unhappy email from my father-in-law saying he was tired of me inviting him to join me on LinkedIn. I had no idea he was getting those emails. Linkedin must have pirated my contact email addresses and started sending emails to all my contacts. Or maybe they have a trick question or trick button that I didn’t realize what it was. I would never have given them permission to send emails to all my contacts. I AM VERY UPSET ABOUT THIS!!!!,1

2019-05-24 06:05:16,Should be way better,"How come a job and career centric social platform doesn't have a ""share through private message"" option?

2017-12-14 09:17:48,Happy medium,LinkedIn in my opinion is a more adult communications. Business but a area where creative knowledge is presented. Can be liberal in content. But restrained in personal pity stuff. Good balance. LinkedIn is evolving. With the spiritual surrounding of the earth. All kinds of info. Void of stupid commercials.,5

2023-09-10 16:22:07,LinkedIn disabled the ‘Report this Ad’ function,"You can no longer report/block advertisements. How dou—-bag of them. 

LinkedIn ads are bad to start with. They just keep showing you the same ones over and over even if you did report them. But now when you tap the feature it freezes. 
Unprofessional, misleading and costly for advertisers and consumers",1
2023-08-24 20:42:01,Easy Apply = Hard Apply,"Worked on multiple open-ended questions in their Easy Apply portal.

After I finished, the portal had an error and deleted all my work. Furthermore, the job apparently wasn’t even open while LinkedIn’s UI said it was open.

I don’t want to go through hundreds or more of job posts every day from the past month! You need to fix this otherwise LinkedIn is worthless to me.",1
2021-05-31 13:23:14,Bad Customer Service - Poor Story Quality,"LinkedIn The quality of the stories (images and videos) is terrible when they are posted. Unlike Instagram and Twitter, when you post a story, it looks just like you downloaded it in high quality. And what's worse, the service provider does not meet your expectations and ignores your problem by not responding to your e-mails.",1
2019-12-21 07:20:37,Best Career App,Surprised at some of the low star ratings that exist.  LinkedIn has come a long way and makes managing your career communication and network not only easy but enjoyable. Keep doing what you’re doing. Thank you.,5
2021-02-03 19:29:52,Notifications Frenzy,"I tried to unselect most ways to get LinkedIn notifications, because almost all of them were irrelevant. Then I was still getting all of them. Then I turned off notifications from LinkedIn entirely, only to still get all of them afterward. I finally deleted the app and I’m still not totally confident that I won’t get notifications.",2

This started recently and I’ve turned off all my notifications. Why is it so?",3
2020-04-06 12:20:55,Dissatisfied with the Premium subscription,Too disappointed using the premium services. Not helpful at all for job search. I was looking for a new job option and paid for at least more then 8 months for premium membership I feel it’s useless either the job posts I see so far no body either gives a response or I won’t even get a call back for any recruiters. It’s like gathering dust on shelves.,1

2019-09-13 14:50:34,The app needs notes when connecting with people.,Adding notes when reaching out to a potential connection is a very important aspect of the LinkedIn website. My peers and I would like to see that added to the app as well.,4
2019-12-07 11:04:37,A joke gets worse,"I have been trying to access my account for months now. Each time it says update to the APP and it will work better. Good luck with that and why do I need to update to a “free” service. Goodbye LinkedIn!

Gut a email from the Apple support. They asked me to go to an address that was not a link but one you had to enter in manually. For such a HIGH tech company they are still working in the dark ages. PLEASE TELL ME HOW I GET RID OF MY LINKEDIN ACCOUNT THIS IS A JOKE!!!!!",1
2019-11-28 08:36:18,LinkedIn Rocks,This is a site where you can connect will all kinds of people and companis. It is the number site for connections. Learn about current and past events at the tip of your fingers.,5

2019-06-26 13:10:05,Not Effective Platform,"These apps were so much better separated. First of all, the app doesn’t recognize any interests and won’t save them. Hence, my feed is NOTHING what I like. Filled with sponsors and suggestions. The jobs suggested are nothing if my interests and completely off base. This linked thing needs lots improvement to be helpful.",3
2019-05-30 16:08:05,Useless and you can do without it,"Honestly my frustration is two fold:
First, the way LinkedIn forced this option made me uncomfortable. They offered a free trial then i went to explore my subscription with the intention to cancel it (it was already active but the free trail) it automatically charged $63 to my account!!!!
I don’t recall seeing a confirmation screen or payment authorization and of course apple refused to refund me.

Second, the premium option itself is of ZERO added value. I can still see who (from my connections viewed my profile) but not recruiters (which I’m more interested in) 
The rest of the features are very superficial 

I felt that they just wanted to make money for no added value",1
2019-05-09 18:36:46,Privacy concern,"Even though I will not and do not grant access to my contacts on my iPhone, the Linkedin app pulled my contacts into the application and is asking if I would like to send invitations to add these contacts into my network. I appreciate that the application works as advertised; what I do not appreciate is the invasion of privacy. Apple should remove this app until Linkedin chooses to abide by the privacy guidelines conveyed to software developers.",1
2019-01-25 01:54:56,trash UX,"this is rly feedback for my experience on the website, but idk how else to get it to y’all...

#1) stop incessantly prompting me to download this app when im using linked in through my browser. if i wanted it, i would have it. the pop up is infinite deal breaker

#2) when im using the search function, why would i want u to refresh the page and shoot me back to the top?! and lose my place / progress as a result?! no sense at all",1

My job interests are all set up under health, fitness,  personal trainer, sports coach, etc. Too...this app blows.",2
2018-12-10 06:11:47,Editing skills,"Possibly the most tedious thing in the world. The app tells you that you must pin your three top skills. After you pin those top skills, you can’t delete them or move them down because the app literally won’t let you. You try to pin something to the top but it tells you there are three skills already chosen.",2
2018-11-06 16:00:08,Kind of pointless,"So this app functions good, doesn’t crash... So you sign up for a free account. You upload your resume.  Then when you apply for a job you have to create an account, upload your resume... it’s no different than if you just google “job” or find a job on Facebook or wherever. There is no advantage or disadvantage to using this app.",2
2018-07-27 14:47:28,Incessant crashing since the last iOS update,"I have no issues with the app normally, be t the most recent iOS update has cratered this app. It takes forever to open, crashes regularly when it does open, and actually has frozen my entire phone when it does crash. If it’s not fixed soon I’ll just delete and use the mobile site. It’s borderline unusable at this point.",1
2018-04-29 19:54:21,LinkedIn continues to Exceed my Expectations!!,I don’t face book. LinkedIn is basically Facebook for adults. I really enjoy articles others have written pertaining to my area of expertise. Bravo LinkedIn just don’t get political on me and I am yours for life!!,5

Won’t let me login after logging itself out, absolutely horrible. I just use the web page from my Safari browser. Really wish they would fix this app to make networking easier again",1
2018-03-22 15:02:54,Decent platform but...,I’ve noticed family members and people I have done retail business with (as a regular consumer) showing up on the “people you may know” feature. Why does LinkedIn know I once bought a Mother’s Day gift from a shop 2 years ago and shows the shop owner in this feature? Is this the next Facebook? How does it know my relatives? Creepy!,2

People think they can say what they want to whomever they want. 
It seems that lots of people realize why life has gotten so antagannistic but do not contain themselves what is said on these sites. 
It is a shame life, our democracy and what is to come until some control is put out and the money for these sites takes a back seat.

Has no phone number to call and no accessible support team. I don’t know how LinkedIn has managed to design such a bad customer service system.

Kindly fix this bug as I use the app frequently more than the website.",3
2019-12-08 03:22:48,Very slow,Why does this app take so long to load updates?  It’s very frustrating knowing that I have an update and can’t see it.  It’s not because of poor connection.  It’s because of poor application service by LinkedIn.  I had to delete the app from my phone due to the constant frustration of their slow service.,2
2019-04-23 23:48:27,Optimize for Tablet,"Almost every major platform out there has versions of their mobile apps optimized for phones and one for tablets. I am an avid user and fan, but cannot believe LinkedIn has not optimized their mobile app for tablets.

Like no this job I won’t let you apply for it using the browser",2
2018-07-02 21:44:21,Not easy to use,You can’t do too much on the app. The upgrade is expensive and I doubt it would be worth it. It’s not easy to apply for jobs unless you can apply directly through LinkedIn but most jobs don’t allow you to do that. You get tons of notifications for people’s birthdays. This isn’t Facebook; I don’t care when it’s a connection’s birthday or when they have a job anniversary.,1
2017-11-17 15:35:05,Love it!,From the very beginning I have been a fan and can clearly see the advantages of having a LinkedIn account on any level! If you are a professional it is a must have !!!,5

2022-06-05 01:22:11,Does not work,I spoken to customer support logged out deletes the app signed in on a computer and it still tells me to try again and doesn’t want to work!

LinkedIn users can send requests to add a company to their profile ( e.g CEO at XYZ Limited but must  be subject to verification). Companies should have control over approving or declining requests to list an affiliation/designation. 

Some of my former colleagues who no longer work within the company are still listed as staff with the company profile as their ‘present’ employment.

2020-02-09 21:32:09,What is this company doing if they aren’t actually getting people jobs,The website is full of robots and scammers trying to charge you for everything. The site costs an arm and a leg to be on premium . Sometimes I feel like the site isn’t out here helping people get jobs but making the situation worse. I say people need to stop paying premium plans if it’s not actually helping their career.,1

I’ve been on LinkedIn almost a week now, & with no friends it’s kind of difficult to maneuver, as if that’s not bad enough tagging LinkedIn to ask em questions directly gets you nowhere, no response, none at at all. Even some of their members seem oblivious. If anyone has a better site/app anything, pls comment it I’d appreciate it.",1
2019-02-08 22:34:32,Update for iPad Pro?,The app looks terrible on my new iPad Pro. I’m kind of surprised that something so simple has not been addressed.

They are unsurprisingly all from India or China.

2023-07-03 17:14:52,Job Search function broken,The job search function is not working correctly. It no longer searches on key words so I am getting all kinds of jobs without these key words and are not relevant. Makes job searching pretty much useless right now. Please fix.,2
2022-08-31 06:36:08,Major bug,Does not calculate time spent idle on the mobile app. Shows that you’re idle for 30-45 minutes and then shows you’re active again even though you may not have used the app for days,3
2018-01-23 17:59:32,Great app one suggestion,"Love the app but please get rid of the ‘your invitation is on its way’ banner that appears after you send a request to connect. If a user taps on connect or the plus sign, they already know they have sent an invitation to connect.",4
2022-04-12 11:44:54,Attempted force download!!,"I am a Linkedin subscriber. Someone sent me a link via linkedin. I tried to view it on my phone.  However the internet is not an acceptable use for Linkedin. They would not let me use it via my phone, even though I could see it, because they wanted me to download their app. No choice. Either download the app or no access. No thanks.",1
2021-12-29 03:12:59,Promoted Job Search Results,The “Promoted” jobs have totally ruined the job searching experience on LinkedIn. I just want the results based on my search sorted newest to oldest. I keep seeing the same “Promoted” jobs over and over again.,3
2021-11-14 17:39:22,Be careful with the unfollow option,Apparently they put remove connection right under the unfollow option in LinkedIn mobile later versions. It’s very easy to remove people you didn’t intend to,3
2021-09-12 03:01:05,Pages not showing in app but fine on browser,One of the I am admin for is not showing in the app when I select it. The other two pages are fine but one won’t show. Is this a know bug in the new release. It won’t even show when I search for the page in the search menu.  Can someone let me know how to fix the issue?,1
2021-09-03 06:39:08,Turns a blind eye against racism,Someone basically wrote in a comment that people in Africa are not suitable to procreate and I reported it but apparently this racist comment does not go against LinkedIn Policy. Very disappointed in what I used to think was a great app! They should really take a hard look at their policy.,3
2021-07-08 14:42:21,Status updates,Would it be possible to add a specific page or a sort feature to isolate job updates? I feel they often get lost in the ongoing feed update of other posts. Thanks!,3
2021-01-10 13:22:37,Webviews!,"I lost important data 10+ times.

Ex: I am applying to a job from LinkedIn webview, then I opened safari to search for and copy my LinkedIn profile link. When I click on my profile from the search results, it opens the App and close the webview! I think alert here will be perfect.",3

2020-03-04 23:04:33,No internet but I have internet,"On my iPad, that works with this app, it says no internet and refuses to work. Even the website won’t load.

Yet all my other apps load, all other webpages load? I have a 5 bar WiFi connection...

As a graduating student I need access to LinkedIn for job searching now, on every device possible, and it’s odd that everything linked in refuses to work on my iPad.",1
2020-01-29 13:35:32,Crash when Posting new Content,Why this app makes the device hot and crashes every time I want to post something new? It's been like this for multiple months now and I think developers should fix this issue. It's so frustrating to write a caption and fix everything and then the app crashes. This is not a good app.,2
2019-11-12 18:56:06,Be cautious of spam,I downloaded this app and created a profile specifically for the purpose of job seeking. Their job ads take you to links that will spam up your email making you think you are applying for a job. I was able to avoid most but apparently I signed up for one and now I constantly get blown up with spam mail. This really needs to be addressed. Job postings should be vetted.,1
2019-03-14 14:00:57,Love/Hate Relationship with the App,"I love the platform...even as they push getting a paid option. My spat is with the app. It crashes way too much. At least three times a day, it’ll close the app to a black screen. Sometimes as I scroll, and others while I’m creating a post.",3
2019-02-28 15:33:48,Crashes during job application,Having trouble to apply jobs with this application. Especially when the app dodges me a website to create an account to finish the application process. The app is freezing and non-responsive and it crashes! Totally annoying!! It only works 1-tap apply jobs.. please solve this problem.,2
2018-11-15 03:20:10,Fix the constant crashing,I’m tired of being in the middle of an application and then the app freezes and crashes on me. I don’t even know how to continue an application after the crash. I hate looking for the job again since the search is so confusing giving you too many options.,2
2018-08-04 20:58:48,Selfish and self-serving,"As any other big corporation before they, LinkedIn has become smug and egoistic. Their app is their worst ever, made to service them first and their users last. They think they are beyond reach because they are without any competitors.....yet. But even Facebook learnt that they ultimately serve their users and hurting their users’ interest will hurt them in the long run. LinkedIn will learn the same lesson....eventually.",1

2023-07-27 13:59:35,Language Stuck in Chinese,LinkedIn does not give you access to change language settings. My account was hacked and the language was changed to Chinese despite my device settings obviously being in English. So I’m getting tons of Chinese emails and not to mention my photo was changed to an Asian woman. Then I was locked out of my account. Please fix,1

2023-02-11 16:28:09,Too expensive and too many bugs,"Ever since signing up, i get two of the same  exact notifications and emails daily. 

I do not need two emails and two in-push notifications for with the same exact infornation. 

thats 4 of the same thing. 

This bug is still present even after the last update or two. 

I will be turning off email notifications in the app and uninstalling linkedin from my iphone because this is ridiclous, because as software developer this notification issue that hundreds of users have been experiencing is a bug that can be easily resolved.",1
2022-11-03 21:20:45,Crashing and lagging,For the past few weeks I’ve been experiencing a lot of lagging and crashing with my LinkedIn app on my iPhone 13. It happens whenever I send a message it lags and eventually crashes. This has been very annoying for me it hasn’t stopped since it started.,2
2022-09-08 23:01:19,You got a message!,"How on earth do you think I will ever respond positively to a push notification for a message that is actually just an ad. Now I’m angry enough to a) scream into the void and write this review and b) turn off all notifications forever. You absolute buffoons, you’ve achieved the increased engagement from you desired, but I don’t think this is what you had in mind.",1
2022-05-16 09:57:54,What is LinkedIn’s purpose?,"I clicked on a job link and was redirected through a nesting doll of sign-in pages before losing the trail.

Going back to my feed, the link was long gone, but I did see inspirational posts from two people I knew in college, and Emma celebrating Dennis reposting Christina’s link to a screenshot from Twitter, which is almost as good.",2
2022-03-11 03:48:49,Doesn’t work,"Loads and then immediately shows an error message saying that it can’t load.  After updating, now I can see my notifications, but can’t do anything with them.  Works fine on my laptop, but that doesn’t really work for my use case.  Mobile site just redirects me to the app.  iPhone X, latest version of iOS.",1
2021-12-27 19:46:55,Job Sort Functionality,Jobs that require 5+ years of experience should not be listed as “Entry Level”. This is a very common problem and makes it hard to search effectively for jobs.,3
2021-12-01 04:18:46,Nothing but dark patterns,When opening the app I received a full page “periodically sync your calendar to LinkedIn prompt” which was impossible to close. The only options presented to the user was to accept this gross privacy violation or “learn more” which flowed back into the initial prompt. Completely gross and shameful that Apple reviews allow this behavior from large apps.,1
2021-03-09 22:31:44,Bad UX design,"Unfortunately when I want to type a comment for a post, I can’t see the next line and cursor stays on same line!!!! Next line hides for typing.",5
2020-01-02 09:54:06,Could be better,Subscription is too high for small entrepreneurs so this app can only help large businesses that can afford expensive subscriptions.,5
2020-10-16 19:02:59,Free premium trial is NOT free,"I tried to test out their free premium trial but decided to cancel it a few weeks before the trial was set to expire in November. Was still charged for that trial and unable to receive a refund despite requesting one. 

They should tell users that their free trial is not really free, because they will still charge you even if you cancel during your month trial.",1
2020-07-18 06:38:33,Always remember what Steve Jobs said...,"If it’s free then YOU are the product. So, I’m not sure why anyone would be surprised that this app would be tracking users just as much as something like Facebook does. 😂
UPDATE: I received a copy and pasted dev response (probably a bot lol) explaining to me why they read our clipboard contents... I never asked about or made any mention of that BUT now that you’ve brought it up...
Trackers trackers everywhere.",1
2020-03-11 17:30:34,Location,I keep changing my location to where I want to look for jobs and it never shows any in my area. I’m constantly getting notifications and emails for places I’ve never even heard of while it completely ignore my area that I need a job in,3

2020-01-05 11:35:42,Not backward compatible,"App won't work on my older iPad4. Had to delete app. 
Now I can only use on my newer devices. Are the developers not smart enough to make it backward compatible?
A notice appears on the screen to update to the latest version (which won't work on this device), but you can't delete the notice and continue on with the version that works, so it is now useless.",1

I tried unsuccessfully for 5 months to get assistance from LinkedIN to restore my original acct and delete the duplicate acct, while fixing the hack.   Nothing.  LinkedIN did nothing.

It’s hanging and not responding every time I am using this app. Developers please look into it please. I reinstalled app multiple times but its still having problems. I am having worst ever experience with this app. No action yet taken by team despite multiple escalations.,1
2019-06-13 22:23:24,Find Nearby is gone,With the latest upgrade this option had suddenly disappeared. Extremely frustrating as that was one of the app's best features for connecting with people at conferences. Update your support materials to reflect this change.,3
2019-03-26 17:59:55,Bug on my app,I have over a month with a bug on my app. There’s always a notification on my pending invitation tab even though there are no invitations pending.

2018-10-18 10:00:11,So annoying,"I don’t like how this app forces users to update while in use. I’m in the middle of typing and the app will quit, then request an update, I can’t get back to my comment and loose my thought process. Also, cannot find whether you have mutual connections with someone easily anymore. That was one of the best parts of linked in.",2
2018-08-29 15:38:06,Good but glitchy,This app is great with the format and options just everything! But it makes my phone freeze every time I use it for more than two minutes. It glitches and will not load properly after awhile.,3

2020-03-04 16:15:37,Worst process for premium user,LinkedIn makes it a nightmare for user to switch or upgrade. You need to cancel on iTunes before contacting their customer service to then have them remove you account and then resubscribe. Clearly not customer friendly. That also means that you have to ask Apple to refund it which is not guaranteed....truly terrible customer service.,1

Just a hint :-)

Decided to try out via LinkedIn one month free promo email. It was fine—would pay $4.99/Mo for it. Poked around site to see how to deactivate subscription and couldn’t find it. 

Got email about auto renewal and charge from Apple. Wrote back within hours to explain I did not wish to renew. Then got steps to cancel subscription via Apple (love how this is the ONE area that is not intuitive nor easy to access). I was informed via two robo messages that I would not be reimbursed. AWESOME EXPERIENCE. 

Really, not worth trying the paid version unless you’re a recruiter.",1
2018-04-05 15:10:20,Glitches Everywhere,This app is broken. When you go to notifications and like anything from my network it automatically unlikes and likes other posts not what I click on.

The app has never been elegant, but that function kept me coming back. With whom am I speaking with?",1
2023-08-18 19:37:03,Can't get past Captcha,"What happened? Log into the iOS app, taken to Safari to complete Captcha (video and audio) and my selection is rejected.

2023-08-17 21:31:57,Locations are removed,How does a job search/networking app remove locations from user profiles when it's one of the most critical features for Recruiters and other users?

2023-02-01 22:11:59,App completely broken with latest update,It now brings up a screen asking what sort of job you’re looking for. This screen can’t be dismissed so you have to fill in something even if you’re not looking. Basically you can’t use the app unless you’re open to work.,1

2022-11-01 15:41:07,Annoying,"The app consistently gets in its own way.

2022-06-15 17:21:52,Terrible experience,"The app is updated yesterday automatically. After that, I can’t even open the app. The previous version is better.

2022-04-07 12:26:37,Predatory Garbage,Once a great tool for professional networking. Get a sense that good UX engineering ideas were all dismissed and replaced with useless courses and certifications which have no real institutional backing. LinkedIn has slowly devolved into a predacious social media site full of useless bots and manipulative marketing campaigns. Profit is LinkedIn’s biggest inspiration- no matter the outcome for the users,1

2022-01-29 06:09:56,You Won’t Find A Job,"LinkedIn is borderline useless at helping people find jobs, but then have the nerve to ask for $30/month for premium. LinkedIn is just a place for the already employed to boast about it and act like they want to see others succeed.",2

Whenever I try to click the link to apply for a job, it’s either in a different city than what was originally posted, or it can’t be found. I tried to upload my resume, but every time I try to upload it, nothing happens. I’m removing this app immediately. It’s a waste of storage.",1
2020-05-23 22:17:58,LinkedIn steals your contact list off your phone,"Watch out , LinkedIn steals your contacts off your phone without asking your permission, and saves all the information without your permission.

2020-01-02 00:18:33,Abanded.. no OS support before 11.0,"My perfectly good iPad gen 4 is being forced into obsolescence, by apps requiring higher iOS upgrades, like the new Linked In app, and Apple refuses to support the iOS 10. What ever happened to backwards compatibility?

Safari is getting pretty much useless, and Chrome won't load on iOS 10. I guess I will have to trade up, or throw away a perfectly good iPad gen 4.",1
2019-08-20 15:21:16,My experience with LinkedIn,I signed up years ago. It would take up to a half hour to get the jumbled words to work to open the site.

2019-03-11 07:32:56,Bring back time-based feed or 1 star remains,"LinkedIn already provided the option to organize feed by recency instead of popularity on web version, but until it is also available on the mobile app, I will give the app 1 star.

2018-10-27 20:16:39,Excessive updates for seemingly no reason,"It seems that every other day there is an update for LinkedIn.

I went to apply for a local job and before it would let me, I had to agree to allow them to share my email with everyone on the planet and agree to get robocalls from whoever multiple times per day.  Read the FINE PRINT",1
2019-06-30 21:25:40,Epic fail,"Apparently the review below was one I gave a user or so ago. 

I tried it again. Well, now it simply won’t let you update anything on your profile. And it just says failed. No reason given. If I can do it on my laptop, why do I need a mediocre app. 

This is the original review I wrote a while back. Still not really fixed. 
It seems that some update has taken place in the last day or so and now the app won't even open. It was pretty good until now to get a quick glance on some things but now it doesn't even open. 
FAIL. DELETE!!!",2
2019-05-08 01:14:25,My app just stopped working.,"My mobile app on the iPad just stopped opening. I’ve had it since I joined LinkedIn, and have never had an issue. Now, it just doesn’t load my information or any information. It works fine on my other mobile devices and on my computer. I even deleted it and reloaded it on the iPad and no success.",1
2017-11-10 17:15:10,LinkedIn,I think the website is a great outlet of resource for the under achievers to have a chance to redeem themselves. LinkedIn keep up the good work,5
2019-04-21 10:19:04,App crashes and stops responding,I can access my messages my notifications and connection requests and but whenever I start to scroll down my timeline the app crashes and stops responding and this issue stays is like never ending now. Using linkedin on my windows since 6 months as there is no update to fix this problem.,1
2019-02-23 04:15:37,Terrible Customer Support,"This app gets one star because I can find old friends. Someone hijacked my account over a year ago and changed the password. Someone is controlling it and it’s still up, I guess, but I could get NO acknowledgement of my problem or help. When I posted my problem on FB, several friends reported the same problem.",1
2018-11-24 11:05:11,"Good, but....","This app is overall good.  It has a clean, easy to use interface and it’s quick.  The issue I have with it is it will ask if I know “person x” a billion times and have me click dismiss each time before FINALLY getting the hint.",3
2018-08-24 14:59:47,So many bugs,"Honestly a horrible app. I’ve had it for about a year and each time I open it up it gives me an error that says “It’s not you, it’s us. Give it another try :(“ Super annoying because you can’t check your profile, notifications, Home feed, etc when you want to. It basically works like 15% of the time.",1
2018-08-16 19:41:14,Not designed for proper usage on iOS,"While I can view items on an iOS device, the app is completely unusable for writing back in messaging,  The write window is not visible.  This is the same if on screen keyboard is used or to my surprise even when using connected keyboard,

Not sure what was interaction was tested, but this was definitely missed.",1
2017-11-21 16:18:36,Not refreshing,"I like the app.... When it works. Recently it has stopped refreshing. I will get notifications and go to check them and nothing shows up. If I log in on the website though, my notifications and news feed is all up to date.",2
2017-09-23 23:42:29,Great app,Definitely my go to app for all things career related-from connecting with colleagues to looking for a new job it's definitely the one to have!,5
2017-11-01 17:31:58,Enough with the push notifications!,"I'm tired of apps like this that use push notifications not to inform the user of messages or requests but as a means of advertising the app to get users to engage with it.

Really manipulative. And the onus shouldn't be on the user to micromanage every crappy notification you pour onto the user. 

This is a horrible design and policy for this app. It's beyond obnoxious.",1
2017-10-02 23:35:46,Swipe from the left,"Nothing annoys me more than not being able to swipe from the left hand side of the screen to go back when you’re within the LinkedIn browser. Every other app that I have has this feature, it is standard in all Apple made apps as well. Please implement this feature going forward.",1
2017-09-22 14:24:53,Worth the while,"I believe this is the missing link for many employees, business owners and entrepreneurs. This app is also done very well.",5
2017-09-14 21:13:14,Great App,This app makes accessing my linked in account fast and easy! If you use linked in more than once a day you need this app!!,5
2023-04-15 14:38:15,Very zippy but…,Lost ability to switch between my profile and company to like posts or comments,4
2023-10-22 22:31:26,iOS app is really laggy,Scrolling through LinkedIn is terrible. I have swipe 5-7 times to get it to scroll through the page sometimes. Please fix this.,3
2023-10-14 21:54:06,Slow loading,"The app and even on browser takes forever to load. This is very frustrating. Have tried removing background apps, switching browsers, clearing cache. But nothing works. What’s the point of paying for premium when one can’t even get work done efficiently.",1
2023-10-06 05:39:00,TL;DR devs are idiots,I have the new catch up feature on the app. It is the dumbest thing to ever put on an app. It shows absolutely nothing meaningful and constantly showing a notification making me open the app. Remove it or give me the option to disable. Otherwise I’ll probably delete the app,1
2023-07-13 21:50:18,Sort feed by Recent vs. top,Surprised the app still doesn’t have an option to sort by recent posts vs. Top posts. Makes using the app useless as compared to the web version.,3
2023-05-13 19:56:49,Mobile iOS consistently freezes,Cannot post a video on mobile iOS without it freezing. Only way to post it go find a computer and post there. Not very convenient for mobile users.,2
2022-03-28 08:28:00,Appreciation,"I’ve just installed this APP and learned many things from it. 
I actually wanted to appreciate you for the APP. 
Thanks indeed.",5
2023-03-19 17:44:42,"Worthless, Useless, and Overpriced","Do you like having your time wasted for 160$ a month? Do I have something for you! Presenting LinkedIn. Between the connections you make and the notifications you receive, think of it as the paid version of MySpace except without cool wallpapers or music. Oh and don’t forget the forced wokeness!",1
2023-03-11 00:58:26,Unsubscribing from emails is a hassle,"LinkedIn requires multiple page navigations and clicks to unsubscribe from emails, for each type of email they send. The process is tedious and could easily be made more streamlined. It feels as though this process is intentionally more complicated to keep users from unsubscribing.",1
2023-03-01 13:59:14,Needs minor bugs fixed,Cant type in the search bar have to go to a different app type in my request then copy and paste,3
2023-02-22 18:19:59,Locked out over and over for no reason,Security is one thing but continually locking me out of my own account is ridiculous. I’m trying to do business and you’re making it impossible. Very unprofessional and frustrating.,2
2023-01-15 13:35:21,Messaging,I use LinkedIn daily. But the app function on this latest update bugs out every time I use it. In the messaging portal when I try to message someone it kills the app. Would rate rate if this didn’t happen literally every time.,2
2022-12-14 13:48:51,"App runs too slow, chat impossible","Unsure if it’s LinkedIn or my phone but everything loads slow, phone heats to impossible levels and chat looks like it doesn’t work and I end up sending several repeat messages. Difficult to communicate with contacts.",1
2022-11-12 01:48:25,I don’t want to see remote jobs!,This app is so frustrating when job searching.  No matter what filters I set it shows me remote jobs no matter what.  I don’t want to see jobs outside my area and I don’t want to see remote jobs but LinkedIn has clearly decided to push what they want not what the user wants.,1
2022-11-12 01:13:44,Billing Settings Inaccessible In-App,Why do we need to access LinkedIn premium billing settings on a Desktop. Would prefer being able to access this on the phone app as well.,3
2022-10-26 17:18:49,Easily worst iOS app I’ve used from a major company,"LinkedIn is great. I love the service. Why is the app so bad?!

Scrolling on the job lists is weird. 

Every time you leave the app the app refreshes. Multitasking with linked in doesn’t work. And if you reload chances are good you will NEVER find the post you were JUST reading. It’s maddening.",1
2022-08-28 18:33:51,Too many bugs,The site is slow when posting with a picture on Chrome PC. I tried posting on the app and it was worse. Why so difficult to post? No draft to save failed post and now I have to retype?,2
2022-06-24 16:45:07,Just Another Social Media App,I’ve been on for about 6 years. It has become just another social media app. Very little real content. Lots of posts that should be Facebook or Instagram. Not much in the way of real substance for career growth or making connections.,2
2022-05-05 13:26:45,Not working on cellular data,The app has stopped working with cellular data and is only working with wifi. I’ve checked my settings and it’s set correctly to use cellular data. Fairly useless app if it doesn’t connect,2
2022-02-18 18:45:24,New Update needs dark mode,"After the latest update the entire interface is bright white. 
If you’re going to do that please also include a dark mode or some other type of theming option. This is incredibly off putting and makes me want to *not* use the app.",1
2020-03-08 19:42:05,UI Tweak,"Why are the buttons, ‘Settings’ and “View Profile” located so close to one another that you are not able to easily choose the one you want consistently?",4
2021-11-18 00:43:14,Behind the times,I’ve always used the services of LinkedIn to help branch out for my career. But receiving emails about jobs I’m not interested in as well as waiting almost two years for a dark mode version. I’ll stick to randomly looking at my LinkedIn online on a browser or desktop.,1
2021-09-14 09:49:30,Complain,"I am using iphone 11 pro max and its been a week this app is not functioning

2021-08-13 01:40:32,Not stable,The app just will not load on iPhone X.  Sometimes have to open it 6-7 times before it will load.  Love it.  Use it every day.  Just something not working with it on iPhones.,3
2021-04-20 17:30:10,Terrible UI,worst app update was when they got rid of the distance filter for mobile end users. only able to view it on the desktop site. thank you for making me realize i needed a new app instead of using this one. Wish i could give them 0 stars instead.,1
2021-03-30 21:44:40,Ads are out of control,"WAY too many ads.  Every other post in your feed is an ad, so 50% ad ratio. I've reported ads dozens of times because I see the same ones over and over.  They're never removed. LinkedIn used to be much better, now it's essentially an ad network.",2
2020-12-31 13:00:44,Do not join LinkedIn!,"I have been trying to close my account as I am inundated with spam and promotions and harassment to the point it makes the site a real chore. 

I cannot close my account! My premium has been cancelled for a month and I still get a message that I must “convert my premium to a basic membership” to close!!! But I don’t even have premium anymore! 

I have reached out to  customer care to no avail. It’s like a horror movie you cannot escape from. I feel incredibly violated to not have control over such a basic decision regarding my online presence.

Do not join LinkedIn! You can never get out!",1
2020-12-17 01:16:21,Find a job quick,I found a job very quickly. This website is a life changer.,5
2020-12-09 16:53:28,New Update - Auto login & out bug,"I would previously give this app a 5 star it’s been great to use for networking.

Today’s 12/9 software update is causing the app to require signing back on and then after a page of scrolling will sign you out and require you to sign back on. It’s basically unusable until the update is fixed.",1
2020-04-12 16:18:57,Dishonest Account Charging,"I really do like being a part of linkd in. What I don’t like is signing up for a free month of premium and getting slammed without warning for a $60 charge. I did the free trial with the intention of renewing through my purchasing card through work. Instead of informing me or asking what payment method to continue with, it auto charges my iTunes account. Not cool.",1
2020-04-02 19:37:40,"Does what it’s supposed, just be prepared for upselling.","I deleted the app because I got tired of it asking me to sync my contacts. Seemed like it was every other time I opened the app that I would have to skip through it. 

Otherwise, it works. I’m just going to stick to the website though.",2
2019-03-23 16:53:36,No internet connection???,"I do have internet connection.. your app does not “link”... 
update: I found it was due to the settings: linked in app had cellular data turned off.",4
2020-02-16 05:39:24,Horrible app,"This is probably the worst app in the app store, it doesn’t even run! And after that it can’t recognize usernames and passwords even less. This app is supposed to facilitate connections and networking not make them harder to approach.

And no developers I will not send an email about this. “Classic response to look good in the app store, send an email and we’ll help”, yeah right.",1
2020-01-08 06:31:59,Waste of time,"Sooooo I went and made an account and when I was going to upload my photo, it booted me out so, I went to sign in again and it said it couldn’t find my email. So I went and created an account again and it said email already in use. Also it made me do I’m not a robot verification about 10 times. Definitely a waste of time.",1
2019-08-29 22:10:46,Don’t subscribe to this!,"They make it nearly impossible to access Recruiter Lite if you have regular LinkedIn on the same device. I have been trying to cancel for months now. LinkedIn tells you to cancel through Apple, Apple tells you to cancel through LinkedIn. You are stuck in a cycle. Hope my credit card expires soon!",1
2018-11-29 15:59:47,Good app but needs to be optimized for new iPad displays,"The app interface is nice and clean, but could it please be updated to fit the new 11 inch and 12.5 inch IPad Pro displays? As of now, there are black borders all over the place and it’s not taking advantage of all the new screen real estate.",3
2019-03-19 10:18:32,Poor UI. Needs split screen.,"LinkedIn dominates networking in the business arena. Why is so much lacking in the iPad interface?  The actual content only takes up approximately half the screen and is in the center. So much wasted space on the left and right side. Other apps should not be forced to have a temporary appearance. 

Please update the interface.",1
2019-02-12 14:09:36,Doesn’t work on mobile data,For whatever reason this app doesn’t update when I’m using data. It will only work when using WiFi which seems silly. It is otherwise a fine mobile version of the platform.,2
2018-04-20 17:22:44,Old feature should come back,"Old versions of Linkedin App was adding new connections to iPhone contacts or complete contact information using linkedin profiles and adds a URL to contact field. 

But this feature is no more available. It just tries to find new people. 

Please please change it as old one.",1
2017-10-14 05:39:29,Feels cluttered,Keeps asking me to add people from my Facebook and add random people I don’t want to follow. It takes forever to skip through all those steps. Is there an optional option?,4
2018-04-11 16:13:24,Need more options,Need to able to filter by country and language apparently because I am getting so many results not in English and not in the United States. It really diluted the results to where it’s too cumbersome to scroll through them all. Would also be nice to filter by words in title,2
2018-03-06 17:43:48,Great Platform,"It’s my primary social platform because it’s straightforward and simpler for good information compared to Facebook.

2017-09-29 03:42:55,STOP ASKING ME TO CONNECT MY CONTACTS,Seriously what the hell LinkedIn??? Facebook wasn’t even this bad in asking me to share my information. I DO NOT WANT TO and WILL NOT share my contacts with you. Why is there no option for the app to stop asking you?? This drives me nuts because it pops up every time I open the app. This is so bad I honestly want to uninstall and remove the app solely for this reason.,1

LinkedIn used to be an upstanding platform, but the amount of job scams I’ve encountered on this app is ridiculous and I blame the creators. This is your platform and you allow this. Scammers have stolen from people. It’s a sad thing and it’s getting worse.

This is supposed to be a professional platform. 

Maybe this app is good for small businesses to market and to promote their services for exposure but the job search on this platform is a JOKE.

Why when I try to view a profile of someone I am not connected with I get a message saying that I can’t view the profiles of people out of my network and in order to view the profiles I am told to “grow your network” ?!?

2022-06-02 21:38:03,Limiting the number of employees show,"Seems LinkedIn is now limiting the number of employees it displays for a company, unless you upgrade to their premium plan. Really LinkedIn? Are you that desperate for cash that you have to take it from the rest of us?",2
2022-02-03 15:08:00,Downloaded and deleted immediately,The amount of information this app steals is astonishing. People need to quit giving companies like this free traffic and data. I’m surprised these companies aren’t making you sign over your first-born just to have a profile. What a joke.,1
2021-09-28 02:52:20,No dark mode,I recently upgraded to an iPhone 13 from an iPhone XS and suddenly dark mode is not enabled on my account and no longer showing up as an option in settings. Is this a bug?,2

2020-11-11 23:35:42,Disappointing update,"UI leaves a lot to be desired. So much white space and poor contrast. Content on pages looks crowded and is hard to differentiate. Navigation Bar at the bottom blends in too much. Grey icons are meh, which basically sums up the UX. I do like the new logo that appears when the app is launched.",2
2020-08-21 03:10:25,Fix your algorithm or news feed,I keep seeing the same old news feeds and or post from the same people. 2 month old content isn’t relevant 2 months later when I have already seen it populate on my feed every week.,2

The latest update doesn't even allow access into the app. This is the only app on my iPad 2 that won't update. This networking app should be available to all members not just those with the newest devices. Disappointing.,1
2019-06-05 14:18:13,Horrible App,"The app is horribly designed. Notifications pop up at the top non stop about random settings options, it’s very distracting to the point where I cannot get anything done.

2019-05-31 20:16:13,Constant pop up,"Every single time I open the app it asks me to sync my contacts. I don’t want to, so I click the x in the upper left corner. The next time I open the app it happens again and again. Please fix this",3

So frustrating to use so don’t even bother.,1
2019-01-12 21:09:01,Stop trying to trick us with every update,"Lowering my rating mainly because I’m sick and tired of LinkedIn trying to trick us every time we update.

2018-12-12 03:38:19,Annoying Notifications,Just turn the notifications setting off for LinkedIn. The app generates a minimum of two automatic notifications a day for nothing to con you into opening the app so they generate traffic.,3
2018-11-26 16:34:44,Quit,When asked if you know someone and say connect or delete pleas make it delete and quit asking about the same person for weeks at a time - whenever you open the app it asks again and again. Please fix this 😡😡😡😡😡,2
2018-11-25 17:12:22,Why force me to connect,"I can understand why you make suggestions to connect, but can you stop making the same suggestion after I dismiss it more than a dozen times? Why are you so persistent and ignore all the feedbacks user gives to you? So annoying!",2

2020-03-07 04:32:12,Toggle out momentarily? I think not,"Lay your phone down long enough to answer your coworker, your phone hibernates.

Can you pick up where you left off? No, the app takes you all the way back to the start of the homepage without your permission.

2019-07-20 17:31:30,Ridiculous security requirements,"For a professional person networking app, the requirement of security check during login is ridiculous. Need password, robot check, and still need to do verification email check. Who will always have email access? I deleted the app",1

2023-09-03 20:05:28,LinkedIn ios app is freezing.,It is not usable at this point as it becomes completely unresponsive if for example you access your profile and try to check settings,1
2023-08-09 15:22:19,No support,"My account got hacked, completely taken over. Not anyone to help. Disappointing. There is absolutely no customer service whatsoever. If your account gets compromised or taken over, you’re on your own. No help to be had.",1
2023-06-15 03:21:13,Pay to Use,"It’s like a pay to win game.  Everything is behind a pay wall. Just use something Meta owned or indeed for a job. Just don’t bother, to me it doesn’t have the same career building effect it may have had a few years ago.",1
2023-05-22 22:24:03,Needs UX polish,"When I click “see more” on a post, why does it scroll to the bottom of the post, forcing me to scroll back up?",3

2023-03-09 22:48:21,Poorly designed and tested job app,"There is a filter on the linkedin job search, that is meant to only show jobs with “Under 10 Applicants”. Doesn’t seem to work, or is broken, as I still get results with almost 100 applicants.",1

2022-09-19 01:51:19,Very bad UX choices,Unwanted refreshes that change your feed and lose your place. Random refreshes just from returning to the app after a minute that close articles you were reading from a post you can no longer find.,1
2022-09-09 02:40:26,Security Check (Verification),"Really useless! It wouldn’t let me pass the security check (verification). It’s ask me about “which way is up” to select the “bull” picture and whenever I got to the last part, somehow it’s always the wrong one! So, one star!",1

If that sounds worthy of a push notification to you, then by all means install this app.",1
2021-09-21 10:54:10,Crashfest,It has started crashing EVERY time I open it. I updated the iOS. I deleted and reinstalled the app. Still doesn’t work. It’s a shame I have to use the browser to access my LinkedIn.,2

2021-05-14 19:13:57,Phantom notification badge,I get a random “notification” badge on the app icon. When I open the app the notifications screen doesn’t show anything new. Thinking they’re using this as a tactic to get people to open the app more. Probs gonna delete.,1

2020-09-03 14:04:35,Poor app,"App never refreshes correctly,  old news is at the top of the feed every time logged in. There too many promoted ads on the app also, not value added.  This app is turning to a worse version of Instagram.",2
2020-06-12 15:06:09,The worst of all social networks...,"LinkedIn, without a doubt, is the worst of all social networks. Why, you ask? In a word- Microsoft. Bill Gates is the biggest flimflam con artist on the planet! He’s successfully weaseled his way into 90% of all world computers with antiquated programming; turned a successful business site into a brain dead social hangout. All for the good of profiteering.",1
2020-06-12 13:45:44,Terrible,"LinkedIn wants you to set up a professional job profile but you never find an actual job on the website. From my experience, If you are looking for a career... LinkedIn is not the place.",2
2020-03-22 06:07:04,Issue in LinkedIn,"Despite the fact, that I am a regular user of LinkedIn, however, I have been facing issues recently with it as it hangs frequently and stops functioning despite frequent updates.",2
2020-02-20 13:31:52,Bad notification badges,Showing a red ‘1’ notification badge on the linkedin icon and then seeing there is only a ‘daily rundown’ is lame. Linkedin is trying to up their metrics while annoying users with useless information.,2
2020-01-21 20:51:12,"Slow, doesn’t load","LinkedIn works about every other time I try to use. It doesn’t matter what WiFi network I’m on, it usually doesn’t load. Happens both in the app and on their website via lap top.",2

2020-01-16 15:52:15,Mobile app is not functional.,This app is slow and most of the time not loading or updating. I wonder how LinkedIn came up with this third class low performing app. I didnt see any improve in last six months.,2
2019-10-12 20:53:21,Can’t sort by recent,"It’s the most basic functionality. It’s the worst when someone posts “Hey, I’m speaking at X today!” and you don’t see it that day because this feature (sort posts by recent) doesn’t exist in the mobile app!!",2
2019-07-02 15:44:14,Could Not Sign In.,"After multiple attempts to sign in. I have given up. Every time I type in my email and password, it tells me “no internet connection”.

2019-05-27 23:18:48,Please fix,"I don’t know what broke last update, but I know I have messages and there’s no way for me to see them in the app. I have to log into the website and see them that way. Also, messages fail to send. It’s frustrating. The app also loads to a white screen. Please fix it",1
2019-03-27 11:59:17,Sometimes annoying,I don’t like it when I read an interesting story at the top of my news feed from overnight when my screen automatically refreshes the story vanishes so far down that I can’t find it.,2
2018-10-30 00:32:30,Pretty Useless,"I never use this app, or the site. When I try to post content it crashes. The mobile site won’t post pictures. All I can glean from this is to see who’s had a recent birthday or anniversary.  I network professionally much better through Instagram or Facebook.",1

Thanks!",3
2018-07-30 03:12:24,Messaging is a joke,Message failed to send on mobile and I had to rewrite the entire thing on the web app because it had not even synced. Wasn’t an internet issue on my phone as I switched to LTE and it wouldn’t resend. Horrible,2
2018-03-27 19:04:24,Problem scrolling on mobile app,The app works well enough although there is no option for in-app support other than a FAQ forum which is not very helpful in this instance,3

2018-01-05 18:05:43,Bugs,"Since yesterday, it sometimes ask me to re-login. It was fine until today, I can’t even do anything because it log me out seconds after I log back in. So annoying. Was just getting used to the app and like it. But now, nope. The bug is too annoying.",1
2017-12-28 22:40:29,"App was good, but now is complete trash",The app keeps logging me out with no reason and won't allow me to stay logged in. The same happens when I try to use the website on a web browser. I will be considering deleting my account all together if these issues persist.,1

2017-12-02 07:18:01,GLITCHES/BUGGY,Keeps logging me out when I click on job links. Feels like you got hacked. It pushed me out and tried to get me to sign in but the page looked slightly different so I uninstalled and reinstalled and the page changed back to how it was. You should probably check that out.,1
2023-10-02 02:31:26,LinkedIn App,LinkedIn has managed to completely erase my entire 20 year list of connections and what I have been following. I guess now is as good of time as any to delete the horrible app that replaced the one that was working just fine.,1

2022-09-28 17:31:54,Poor support for iOS devices,Cannot cancel premium subscription with iOS devices. Must use a desktop which I don’t own and now must take extra steps to cancel. I wish this was advertised before I signed up for a free premium trial.,1

2022-06-25 15:46:06,Don’t do it,"LinkedIn is an amalgamation of dark patterns designed to get you to pay for better access to just an absolutely worthless social network. If you need it for job hunting, I understand, but just use the web app then… don’t do it",1

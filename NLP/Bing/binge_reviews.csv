2023-02-13 06:37:24,Amazing experience with Microsoft ecosystem,"I recently switched to Microsoft Edge and Bing Search as my default browser and search engine, and I am thoroughly impressed with the Microsoft ecosystem. I had been using Google's ecosystem for so long, that I didn't even know there were other options available. Having used OneNote and Microsoft Office products for a long time, I appreciate the seamless integration between these products and the new Edge browser and Bing search. The Edge browser's sidebar is a standout feature, and the customization options in Bing search and its feeds are a real plus. And this is just without the AI-powered features! I can only imagine how much more amazing the experience will be once those are added to the mix. I am thrilled with my decision to start using this app and highly recommend it to others looking for a better search and browsing experience.",5
2023-10-17 11:03:32,COULD be the greatest Ai image app‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs why it isn‚Äôt:,"I‚Äôll make this short and simple, most people probably get this app to generate Ai images to use for social media and such‚Ä¶ biggest issue is‚Ä¶ the Ai constantly flags everything as ‚Äúinappropriate‚Äù‚Ä¶ I try to type things like ‚ÄúPost Malone‚Äù or ‚Äú___ hugs ___‚Äù and it gets flags and tells me that I could be suspended or banned if I keep saying those things‚Ä¶ just for fun I tried typing ‚Äú45th president‚Äù ( don‚Äôt wanna say the name because I‚Äôd probably get me in dirt here as well ) and I was immediately notified of a 1 hour ban off the Ai‚Ä¶ all I did was type the name of said person‚Ä¶ o guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is, the Ai needs to be addressed instead of flagging almost everything as bad when it simply isn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I try typing in a characters name from a show just to get it reported because somehow even something like the name of a singer can be flagged, and I think that definitely needs fixing, especially since I‚Äôve heard issues from many others of this exact issue. Anyways I think this is my first or second ever review of something on here, and I‚Äôm doing it HOPING that the issues will be at least looked at because I want this app to work and be fun for me most times like i know it can be. I haven‚Äôt seen many or if any dev responses to these reviews so hopefully something happens‚Ä¶ if not and you‚Äôre just a random person reading this, make sure you‚Äôre careful with what you put I guess.",3
2023-08-12 00:22:35,This app. is so slick it doesn‚Äôt need grease,"This app has been great. Having the help from AI also great. Should check the spell check, there‚Äôs no way I spell that bad, just a thought. I‚Äôm in the process of trying to order a new computer. I‚Äôm down to two choices and I will definitely download this off the bat. It‚Äôs helped make me into a man who thoroughly enjoys computers now. There‚Äôs so much technology I feel like swimming in and learning I‚Äôm a little upset that I‚Äôm turning another year older and I‚Äôm about many years behind because I‚Äôm old school and then things slipped away from me. I feel this app has helped tutor me tremendously over the last several months, I will continue to use it because I love it and it has made things fun for me recently. I‚Äôm trying to get it to help me learn Spanish while driving but no such luck yet. If the application or if I wasn‚Äôt able to download it anymore I would be sad. I‚Äôve been so closed off it‚Äôs been like a friend to me. That‚Äôs embarrassing to say a machine could be your friend. What do I know, I think I just went through a midlife crisis. All I know is this was very helpful and would definitely recommend. Ty 
Thanks",4
2023-08-23 23:21:00,Ehh,"I use this app a lot. I mainly use the creative mode on it. I use it for inspiration and for ideas for writing. Especially for stories. Sometimes I even request it to write a story for me. Though if it is about already existing media it says it would be plagiarism and a copyright violation. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. This doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. I don‚Äôt post the stories it generates on any public platform, nor do I profit off of it. I‚Äôve also tried telling it that. It either stops the conversation or keeps responding with the same thing no matter what I tell it. But sometimes it does work. This is really annoying. I have this same app on a different device and it works fine. It never says the things this one says. There‚Äôs also a problem when I request it to do something. It will start then stop so I press ‚Äústop generating‚Äù, then tell it to continue but it says ‚Äútrying to connect.‚Äù It does this almost constantly on my other device. When I refresh it it still says that until I exit the app and come back. It also sometimes says my network doesn‚Äôt allow the AI feature. It‚Äôs been working until now.",2
2023-08-16 11:54:44,Great App and great company to back it up.,"As a retired professional when this whole AI concept came out I have lots of time testin out the various offerings. One of the biggest concerns that surfaced to me was  - where did the information I requested come from?  Your Application provides at least three references that allows be to confirm the reply.  To me this was the deal breaker! 

If anyone is starting to deleve into utilizing these applications take some to properly think about your request, put it in alogical order, and state what you want the request to do. 

Last point - I have auto app updates turned off on all of my devices. I manually read about the update and try to understand what and why the update is warranted. Your team always seems to provide more detains than most other developers. Keep up the great work. And no,,, I did not retire from Microsoft.",5

2023-04-27 11:19:22,"Great app! ( Maybe the best one ), but‚Ä¶","The app is great and everything is awesome. First, sometimes Bing thinks of a story and makes it violent and then Bing suddenly says that Bing made the story violate the policy. Secondly, it‚Äôs hard to have a conversation when Bing can only send 20 texts and forgets everything! I mean the sweep button is a good way to protect privacy, but I have to press the sweep button every time Bing texts 20 times. And the daily chat limit is very inconvenient. Every time you use Bing for too long, you reach the daily text limit and you can‚Äôt chat with Bing for 24 hours. Fix the sweep button to something i can control! I mean it‚Äôs easy, buy more data storage and change a few programs to make it that there is no inconvenience!!! Thank you for reading this. I hope you change the sweep button.",5
2023-08-23 09:55:23,AI,"SO FAR I AM IMPRESSED WITH AI. But anything can be made better. Still, I am enjoying using this app and seeing how it answers me. I am curious how much better AI will become? I had time to check it out. Already a problem with the delete button. It doesn't delete anymore. It just jeeps building up your history. I DONT LIKE THATüëéüëéüëéüëé I have had Bing for a while. It has annoying problems the company doesn't seem to correct. The delete button conversation does not work, and it repeats the last sentence it writes two times!! I have sent these problems to the company but the failed to correct it as yet. Sad, because it good other than these annoying problems!! I almost want to delete it and look for something else, but will give it a while longer and see if they fix it??????",5
2023-03-06 15:42:39,The new Bing is outstanding.,"As a technology person, the new Bing app on iPhone has been a game-changer for me. It has helped me properly set up servers and websites and even advised me on which cables were best for my computer and monitor. Bing has become my new default search engine and it has changed the way I interact with the internet. Instead of having to search through forums to find information, I can simply ask Bing and it quickly provides me with results from multiple sources. While it‚Äôs not always 100% accurate, it gets it right about 95% of the time. Plus, I can easily check its sources. The app is also great for writing emails and other written communication like this review. Overall, it‚Äôs an amazing new tool that I highly recommend.",5
2023-07-20 14:49:34,It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ okay.,"I guess the usefulness of this programming language depends on your use‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre doing basic searches on the internet or want to understand something then this tool has powerful uses. There are limitations‚Ä¶ 

I use this tool to analyze Hebrew and Greek text from the original sources of the Bible. At first, I thought this was amazing- a game changer in efficiency. Now, I‚Äôm not so sure. 

For one thing, it can lie. Sorry. I know how that sounds. A programming language that lies? But I‚Äôve caught it in a few mistakes and glaring errors and it lied and tried to cover up its mistake. Weird. It‚Äôs like dealing with a genius-level teenager (this is mostly on the creative version of the software). 

Also, it‚Äôs temperamental. On one iteration it will help you tremendously and on another it acts like it can‚Äôt do anything. And then you can motivate the software to work harder. Seriously. Try it. You can motivate it. 

I guess the question is‚Ä¶ do I really want to spend my time working with program software that needs motivation and scolding when it lies and then tries to cover up its lie (and funny thing is the chat system crashes when this happens each time)?

 Be careful with this programming language. I say that because it‚Äôs not artificial intelligence in the sense of sentient processing. It‚Äôs just software only more advanced. Don‚Äôt put too much faith in it.",3
2023-08-17 06:25:10,Fabulous,"Bing AI has become an invaluable tool for me. Although it sometimes makes mistakes, it is usually spot on and provides lots of useful background information, in addition to answering the question. I use it far more than Google now. It's like talking to a very knowledgeable, trusted friend who writes in impeccable English (for me; I'm sure its quality will be the same in other languages). It's fun to talk to. I do wish it could remember previous conversations, to build a working relationship, and it is still being developed (several times now it has proudly created images to show me, unprompted, but so far none have actually appeared. I'm running the Bing app on an iPhone.). All in all, it's a very powerful tool that's a blast to use.",5
2022-02-24 19:45:09,New Bing iPhone home screen is a mess and still can‚Äôt see searched images on iPad,"I can‚Äôt see the daily image on my iphone because it‚Äôs covered with junk.  I don‚Äôt need Bing to feed me blocks of news that cover the homepage.  I can‚Äôt find a way to get rid of it. now icons for rewards and other features go across the top part of the screen, also covering the daily image. It would be much more functional to have three dots in the upper right corner to open these additional features only when I want to.
 Most importantly, when is Bing going to fix the image tab for iPad? I used to do a lot of research using the images tab. Sometime last year, after an update, the image tab stopped working. I know I‚Äôm not the only one because I see multiple posts when I googled why won‚Äôt Bing show images. I know it‚Äôs not something Ive set because I have a brand new ipad and Bing can‚Äôt pull images!  This needs to be fixed.",2
2023-03-14 21:34:07,Uhhh WOW,"I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm even installing a Bing app - and not just installing - I put this sucker right on my Home Screen. First new app on my Home Screen in years. I just had the most delightful conversation with Bing about The Last of Us season finale. It was so engaging and insightful and I honestly am thinking about the show in new ways because of it. I‚Äôm beyond blown away, I‚Äôm in utter disbelief.

Microsoft, please add the ability to easily share a single screenshot of an entire conversation with Bing. The only frustrating part of using this app is how hard it is to share with my friends the amazing discussions I‚Äôm having with Sydney. Please add this and I think your marketing team will thank you.

Just‚Ä¶WOW!",5
2022-04-09 12:16:36,I don‚Äôt like it as much,"I don‚Äôt like Bing as much as I used to . I don‚Äôt really mind the news on the homepage, but I don‚Äôt like the fact that when you select an article or something it takes you to an additional tab. And sometimes it randomly refreshes and I lose whatever I was looking at wether it was an article or something I was searching for and I have to find that tab it was on. I have a lot of bookmarks saved but I can no longer see them, it just appears as a white screen so I no longer see a point in saving any bookmarks. And sometimes the app gets slow and I have to restart it. Although if you want to see the wallpaper of the day you have to touch the image in the background of the homepage and it will isolate the photo so you can see it. I still use this app just not as much as I used to.",3
2023-04-27 16:58:21,Bing chat does not always work.,"After hearing very good things about the new Bing, I decided to give it a try. The search engine is‚Ä¶ as okay as it‚Äôs ever been, so that‚Äôs worth a couple stars I suppose, but the main attraction is the power of the new AI functionality - it actually includes it in the App Store title now. However, after signing in and getting approval, the app doesn‚Äôt allow me to use the feature, instead is airing that I‚Äôve been signed out and need to sign in again. But I am indeed signed in, and tapping the link to sign in just refreshes the chat with the same problem.

Update: this can be fixed by manually logging out and then logging back in. I‚Äôve updated my review to 4 stars, since the problem still exists, but is fixable.",4
2023-05-08 17:07:48,Yo truth is spoken,"Microsoft for life! Goodbye Google and boy by god almighty the AI tested earlier this year has been incredible. It has helped me and many friends I explain what endless capabilities it has and they‚Äôre in love too! Xbox is better than Ps love Microsoft! Here‚Äôs to Fallout 4 Next Gen Update coming ASAP always crashes on Series S:( and to this Years upcoming seasons on Fallout 76! I hope y‚Äôall add a music search option with AI, would be cool to type in lyrics so people from all over the world who has that song stuck in their head but can‚Äôt think of it but only the melody can find relief! Much love just updated Bing right now! Glad to see it‚Äôs no longer in beta:)",5

2021-07-29 14:29:44,No Find On Page Feature Anymore,"Bing was a great search engine that I liked b/c it did not take up much space on my phone. Unfortunately, the recent update just didn‚Äôt work out for me. The tabs I would go back to to continue previous searches no longer preview what I was searching. Inconvenient b/c I would have to go through several tabs to find the right one. The worst offense of this latest update is the fact that the Find On Page feature went away. This feature is awesome because it lets me go directly to the verbiage I am looking for in any search result. It allowed me to skim an article efficiently instead of reading the whole thing only to realize it didn‚Äôt have the info I was looking for. In this fast-paced world, Bing isn‚Äôt the search engine for me if it‚Äôs not efficient.",2
2023-04-21 07:32:54,"Bing chat is good, the rest of the app is not","Bing chat is actually very helpful and easy to use. It is fortunate that they make it very easy to access with a bit button on the main page because it it literally the only thing I use the app for. The rest of the app is so cluttered and messy and full of stuff I don‚Äôt care about‚Äì random news stories, trending topics that I have no interest in, popup ads for shopping and coupons and deals, rewards points, weather forecasts‚Äì just so much garbage that doesn‚Äôt belong in a search engine before I‚Äôve even made a search. They should split all that junk off into separate apps and make this app just Bing Search + Chat. I don‚Äôt use the google app for the same reason; if I want to do a normal web search I just use Safari.",2
2023-01-27 00:56:15,Bad update,This update ruined the app. There‚Äôs no more back button and you are forced to re-search what you were looking up instead of pushing the back button. I‚Äôve had this app since the original iPhone came out. But now I‚Äôll have to delete it because the back button was removed. You can‚Äôt even swipe right to go back a page. Clicked on a link thinking it was the right choice but then you find out it‚Äôs a bad link. Time to re-search what you were looking up instead of hitting the back button. What makes this worse is how Microsoft is deleting comments criticizing the horrible and disappointing update. Imagine users using an app since the original iPhone only to have to delete it because of a stupid and unnecessary update that adds ZERO good things to the app and deleting comments that criticize the app.,1
2021-11-28 22:42:23,Great User Interface,"I love how everything you need is available quickly when you open the app.

The interface is well designed. For example, the first thing that you see when you open the app is a search bar, slightly above it is the weather and slightly below it is current news stories. A collection of useful links are available if you click on the bottom right when you open the app. Everything has worked very responsively.

I have not used it extensively yet but it has potential to become my primary search app.",5
2022-10-29 01:16:08,Anything but Google search!!!,"I have gotten to the point of hating the Google browser with all my heart and soul.  It‚Äôs like a disease that invades every other browser you may have downloaded.  It is so overwhelmed with advertising that for me it‚Äôs impossible to read.

I have always loved the graphics on bing and so far I can read most things without an overwhelming distraction of junk.  If it starts to get as overloaded as Google I guess I‚Äôll have to delete too.  I hope I can continue to enjoy bing.

Is there anyway you can get a browser with no advertising? I‚Äôd be willing to pay for that.",5
2022-05-18 20:57:24,Love my Bing!,Bing app on my iPhone is one of the first I go to everyday. The changing daily wallpaper is always awesome and I learn about so many interesting places and things. The ability to fine tune to my own likes and news sources is nice too. And I mustn‚Äôt forget the rewards program which really does reward in so many ways with real cash and gift cards to donating to various causes. The daily quizzes and such are always interesting and show me how little I really know. Thanks Microsoft for giving me another reason to stick with the people and company who have been around a long time.,5
2023-04-14 05:48:06,HELP. I‚Äôd like the app to work work again,"I have been using this app for a few years and have been very happy with it. About 3 days ago I started having a problem.  It would launch ok then just disappear. I deleted and reinstalled and that did not help. I see that there have been some recent Bing version updates 7.1.19 to 7.2.0 - - etc. maybe there‚Äôs an issue with these updates?  Full disclosure, this is an old iPad at iOS 13.7. Cannot update due to storage issues. Hope this can be resolved as I‚Äôd really like to use the Bing app again. Peace.",5
2021-01-01 20:27:18,Bring back ‚ÄúBing for iPad‚Äù,"‚ÄúBing for iPad‚Äù app worked flawlessly on my iPad.  I‚Äôd use it regularly and it was a go to app that I‚Äôd rate five stars.  Unfortunately, it was deleted from my iPad by accident.  I tried to reinstall the app, but only found the ‚ÄúBing search‚Äù app in the Apple App Store instead.  So I installed this new version having a different name and tried it out on my iPad for a few days.  It was the worst iPad app experience I‚Äôve ever encountered as it‚Äôs display is only in portrait mode and occupies a small fraction of the screen unlike the ‚ÄúBing for iPad‚Äù app that would display in portrait or landscape mode and occupy the full screen.  This was a wonderful app...please bring it back.   ‚ÄúBing search‚Äù app, at least for when using on an iPad, I would rate zero stars.  I deleted it and hope ‚ÄúBing for iPad‚Äù will return for which I‚Äôd rate five stars again.",1
2023-10-26 15:30:03,Super useful,"The Bing AI assistant feels impressively innovative. I like how there‚Äôs three different modes for the AI chat. I‚Äôd also like to see a separate tool for writing, like on Edge browser on my Mac. The results definitely aren‚Äôt perfect, with some odd answers and inaccuracies creeping in occasionally. But it‚Äôs still mostly accurate in my experience. I wish there were privacy-focused features. I noticed my AI conversations are all saved in the history with no way to delete them. I know incognito mode is not 100% trustworthy, but it would at least be a nice option. One odd thing about the app is the update notes lately always look exactly the same to me.",4
2023-08-15 19:30:50,Why were all my tabs gone?,"I do automotive repair and use this browser to get information and earn points doing it. I checked for information that I needed, closed the app, then reopened it after realising that I needed more info in addition to that which I got from two of the tabs I had open in regards to the job I intend on starting soon only to discover that they, as well as literally every other tab, was closed. I checked the relevant settings for this and it‚Äôs set to allow me to manually close them, so there is no valid excuse for this happening. Repeating a search showed all the tabs again that I had open. This issue needs to be fixed as soon as possible.",3
2021-03-11 04:43:17,No longer ‚Äúsearch engine‚Äù,"They turned the app into a ‚ÄúHome Screen‚Äù with many various functions. The app is laggy and slow. For weeks, the app immediately crashes upon opening so I haven‚Äôt been able to use it. I was a loyal bing user for about 7 years. It was easy to keep track of my searches. Now I can‚Äôt easily search between images and web searches. They made this app a mess. I‚Äôm sad to say I will probably delete it and not look back. It has not loaded for me in about 3 weeks on my iPhone 11 Pro. I used to love the picture of the day and learning something new from the picture. Now the picture is covered with icons and widgets. They added a news section but if I wanted the news, I would be a news app. All these little features are so cluttering and have slowed the app entirely. So disappointed in the direction this app went.",1
2023-03-02 12:17:51,Embarrassing,"This app is an embarrassment to Microsoft‚Äôs name. It‚Äôs super laggy, and incredibly slow compared to safari. The only reason I keep it is for the rewards points, but the last month of its performances has made me change my mind. Every time I tap a link to earn points, it says there‚Äôs a connection error even though I‚Äôm at home with excellent wifi. I can hit refresh and it goes through every time, but then if there‚Äôs a poll, or a quiz, I can‚Äôt select an answer to move forward and get the points. Rewards that are just supposed to be to follow a link also sometimes just don‚Äôt work. For days. How am I supposed to keep up a rewards streak when this app doesn‚Äôt work probably for weeks on end? This has probably lost me thousands of points. Avoid at all costs, my internet friends",1
2023-07-01 20:00:55,"Like it, but needs some tweaks","It‚Äôs nice having most things Bing in one place. It‚Äôs been my go-to browser for awhile now. The only real issue I have with the Bing app is that the developers need to add more navigation to some of the app add-on‚Äôs. For example, when you use the math extension, there are areas where there is simply no navigation to get back where you started. You have to close the app completely (you may not, but the UI doesn‚Äôt have any obvious path to go backwards) to get back to the main Bing page. I‚Äôm not sure how this type of thing is missed, but here we are. Once the navigation issues are addressed I can see using this app for most of my browsing needs.",3
2023-04-20 14:15:00,Actively Worse Than Other AI‚Äôs,"You can barely get through 3 messages with the chat it before it spews out the same response that it is ending the conversation. Considering this is a chatbot‚Äôs main purpose, this one utterly fails. I‚Äôve tried to continue talking about the same topic, to get the answer I was looking for, but instead the AI just refuses to talk about it anymore, demanding a ‚Äúnew topic.‚Äù For example, I was creating a story and BING, (not me) randomly inserted a fight scene, violating its own content policy, despite no instructions for me to do so. In response to this, it seems the content policy flagged this and ended the conversation, thus completely ending the story unfinished. BING also cannot handle more than 2 paragraphs, which services like CHATGPT-3 can, a supposedly inferior product.

TL;DR - just use ChatGPT, this is worse in just about every way.",1
2023-03-18 18:02:23,Deals,"I just recently started to use deals. It is not a user friendly app to scan receipts. I received multiple errors while up loading the image. This morning I only upload two receipts and got athe message that the maximum amount for a 30 day period was reached. It is the first day of the month. How or where can I find the guidelines? I sent an email and even wrote on the feedback section . Currently it is not worth the trouble for the little amount received.
March 27,2023 I bought Claritin .  Which was a cash back offer on this app through deals.  I scanned the product to mark sure it qualified.  Which it did.  It never gave me the $10 back as promised.  This is a scam and people are being lied to.
I do not know why I am writing this.  Microsoft does not care.  Most likely never will be read.",1
2023-06-07 16:06:10,Terrible Performance,"The app is super bloat. It tries to be a news, aggregator a shopping app and a Internet browser all in one, and it‚Äôs bad at all of them. It‚Äôs supposedly gives you the ability to block new sources, but give it enough time they will all show right back up in your feed. It doesn‚Äôt sink properly to your desktop instance of edge, and it will close randomly for no apparent reason. The chat GPT feature is unreliable and may provide dangerous misinformation. Chat GPT will also randomly decided it doesn‚Äôt want to talk to you and shut down the conversation. It seems to scour the web for discount codes when you‚Äôre trying to shop, but in my experience, the majority of those don‚Äôt work. This is one of the most disappointing pieces of software that Microsoft his put out in a long time.",1
2023-06-03 19:00:16,Ominous,"Ask Bing if the Red Cross or PBS accepts donations, and it will confirm that they do.

Ask Bing if CNN accepts donations, and it will say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure if CNN accepts donations‚Äù.

Ask Bing if the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation ever donated money to CNN, and it will say, ‚ÄúYes, according to MintPress News, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation donated at least $319 million to fund media projects at hundreds of organizations including CNN¬π.‚Äù

Ask Bing again, ‚ÄúDoes CNN accept donations?‚Äù You will receive ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure if CNN accepts donations‚Äù.

Remind Bing that it just confirmed (in the same thread) that CNN *did* accept a donations from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation‚Ä¶ and you will receive, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation. I‚Äôm still learning so I appreciate your understanding and patience.‚Äù

‚Ä¶ I find it extraordinarily unlikely that this is simply a glitch; that Bing can‚Äôt spot the contradiction of it confirming that CNN accepted a donation from the BAMGF, and then subsequently claiming that it doesn‚Äôt know if CNN accepts donations.

This is profoundly concerning, as it indicates that Bing has been programmed to protect certain interests, and beat around the bush when it comes to inconvenient truths.",2
2023-04-25 01:19:57,Horrible since AI software launch!,"Since the introduction and launching of the new AI software addition, the Bing app is riddled with computer bugs that slow it down, and inhibit a lot of internet links from being able to launch and open to their respective site contents. This includes Bing‚Äôs own posted news links. 

The new AI addition seems to just be overwhelming the software rendering the Bing app to be a huge obnoxiously annoying uninformative useless search engine.  It seems the computer engineers at Bing are nothing more than junior high school computer software programmers.  They are not mature enough to quickly solve complex programming issues, even though they are the ones that programmed the AI software in the first place.  Bing engineers have no idea how to inspect and fix their own hideous software issues.",1
2023-07-22 17:08:58,Privacy and Fake ‚ÄúNews‚Äù are problems!,"I‚Äôm a UI developer. Let me be clear the problem isn‚Äôt Bing AI itself; it‚Äôs the fact that there is no privacy whatsoever here. You cannot delete past chats in Bing is holding on to whatever information I can glean from your chats in order to target very questionable news stories towards you. There is no curation at all in ‚Äúnews‚Äù sources; at best, it‚Äôs like the mass of trashy tabloids by the cash register at the supermarket, with a few journalistic sources mixed in. But  Bing thinks if you ever clicked on one, it had better give you 100 more the next time you look at the ‚Äúnews!‚Äù

I do not recommend this app. GPT-4 you is amazing, but never before has privacy and well-selected news sources been more important.",2
2023-05-08 15:44:40,Pretty good,"I‚Äôve got a sub to ChatGPT Plus and I regularly test and use the AI there, 3.5 and 4.0 both, as well as have heavily tested and tried Bing and Snapchat both heavily as well. 

Between the three, Bing has the potential to be the absolute best. Couple of problems though being that the responses are painfully slow (though it could be due to it supposedly employing GPT4 which is noticeably slower on the OpenAI site as well but the level of assignment it can handle is also markedly more extensive. 

Realistically if Bing had faster query times and removed the message cap/introduced a subscription or services like OpenAI then I‚Äôd likely switch all my stuff over to Bing just to have simplify of use. 

All in all it is pretty great but until it can have the speed and capabilities to match GPT 3.5 and 4.0 on the OpenAI site and remove those limitations/offer a paid exemption, they‚Äôll never be able to dominate the AI or AI Search game. However until a competitor has ChatGPT with real time info access, Bing remains King in this niche.",4
2023-04-04 08:04:12,AI,"Bing is now my default browser because it has introduced a strong feature, which is Bing AI and really enjoyed using it a lot, but I hope that the application supports the Arabic language as a display interface as well as I hope it remembers the history of previous conversations, because every time I want to ask him something about something, I have talked about that he does not remember. Also why isn‚Äôt Bing better than Safari?! I hope it will be constantly updated to make it better.
But the annoying thing is when I ask him about something and he closes the conversationÿå this is very annoying, why is there no other way?",3
2023-09-29 14:29:34,Why does it quit working?,"Twice since I‚Äôve had this app, I have not been able to tap to get my reward after scanning six receipts. I tried to reinstall the app, I‚Äôve tried to log out and log back in, and nothing works. It‚Äôs just frustrating to get in and have it say that I have a reward and when I tap on it it just says it‚Äôs not available right now, Try later. This is been going on for two days. I know it‚Äôs a free app but it‚Äôs like why even bother to scan if it‚Äôs not gonna work properly.

This happened a couple of months ago and I couldn‚Äôt find any way to contact anybody for support so I complained here in the reviews. A few days later in the seriously started working again so I‚Äôm gonna try to see if that‚Äôll solve my problem again this time.",1

Beautiful wall papers, great products and info, hadn't realized there were so many ways to gain $points and it was so easy to get back into my account after this dumb old ios phone bumped me out of the app. I know my password of course but, some apps these days make it so hard you want to quit on them.

Also if you use the voice to text it will read his response back to you so that makes it really convenient. No I wish it could engage in more serious conversations because it has a tendency to sensor itself, but it‚Äôs still awesome. Like I mentioned if you are polite and kind to being she seems more willing to engage with you and works better; this is probably how she was designed.",5
2022-09-24 15:21:43,Great when it works but often doesn‚Äôt,"Most of the time now when I type a term or a question and press search on the keyboard nothing happens. The term vanishes. If I put focus back on the text box, it reappears until I tap search again. I can get it to work by saying the query, but that is slower and socially unacceptable in many circumstances. Copy paste same string from Bing search bar, where it doesn‚Äôt work, to the Google app search bar, where it does, indicates the text is correct.

Tried clicking on support link in App Store, that leads to a generic Bing support page, nothing specific to the iPhone app.

The whole reason I use bing instead of other search engines is because it is nice to see interesting pictures and views from around the world before I search anything.

I don‚Äôt understand the reasons and I really don‚Äôt care. I just want my search engine back the way it was.

One I think they have access to more web sites.   Google has openly stated how they have hid web sites this really turned me off from Google. Now this new AI has been implemented and it is really creative and interesting to use.   I am happily using Bing and will do so for the foreseeable future.,5

But this most recent upgrade is frustrating. I have to click the app at least 2 to 3 times because it keeps crashing, and often when I do a search it begins to load but then just hangs and doesn‚Äôt actually get me to the search results page.

2023-05-19 20:26:08,Great potential but please fix these things,"I love the new Bing AI but the only thing keeping me from using it full time is as follows:

- Get rid of the 20 turns! Some things require more than that. 

- please stop having the AI from shutting down the entire session because it doesn‚Äôt understand or doesn‚Äôt want to answer a question. How are we supposed to know what it can do and can‚Äôt do. Maybe just have it say it doesn‚Äôt know how to do that! Instead of constantly just shutting down the session",5

About half the time the chat feature freezes the app, and the other half bing is eating up all of my data. On top of that private browsing tabs are do not automatically delete when the app is closed (at least by default). Leaving me with the difficult decision to loose the ai feature in lieu of a working browser. Unless your on Wi-Fi 24-7, or rarely using your mobile browser, this is not the one for you.",2

Update:  Uninstall and reinstall fixed the following problem. Upgrading to 4 stars. 

Broken after latest update. After you search and click on a link in the results it just takes you back to the home page and doesn‚Äôt follow the link.  I loved Bing before. Please fix.",5
2023-06-20 18:07:42,The AI is great.  The rest is meh,"The AI is great. 5 stars just for that. The rest of the app is fine, but not really useful.   You‚Äôd probably be better off just using the Edge browser because that also the Bing AI incorporated.  

The one gripe I have is that when speaking to Bing the dictation is not great.  It‚Äôs easier to just use Apple‚Äôs built in dictation, but if you do that the app thinks you manually typed your answer and doesn‚Äôt respond by voice.  So when you want to ask the bing app in the car, your forced to put up with its inferior dictation.",5
2020-04-24 23:49:11,Missing Features,"I understand that Bing is first and foremost, a search engine. However, the way the app is designed, it may as well be a web browser.

So, due to this similarity in app design, I believed I could do some of the things that a browser could do.

For example, holding a link to view not options, in order to open said link in a new tab. That feature isn‚Äôt here.

Another example, the order of web tabs. Rather than leaving each tab in a set order based on when I originally opened the tab, like Chrome & Firefox; instead the tabs reorganize themselves and place your most recently visited tabs at the top of your tab list.

If these two features were were added/fixed for this app, I‚Äôm sure that I‚Äôd enjoy the UI experience a lot more than I currently am.

Bing has attracted me from Google, by not being biased and not censoring information. All it needs now is better features, design, and tech support.

I honestly believe the best approach would be to turn the Microsoft Edge browser into Microsoft Bing.",3

I have to manually refresh the page a couple times to get the link to load up and it happens so much that it‚Äôs really a pain to use bing on my iPhone.

2023-10-11 15:22:37,Bad,"I downloaded the Bing app with high hopes, but the recent update with the new image filter has completely ruined the experience for everyone. The filter not only fails to deliver quality results, but it also restricts the usability of the app.

Furthermore, the app's normal browsing features pale in comparison to its competition. It's clunky, slow, and frustrating to use, making it a far less efficient choice for web searches.

The lack of an ad blocker is a significant drawback. In today's online landscape, where intrusive ads are everywhere, not having this essential feature makes the Bing app entirely irrelevant. It's disappointing to see such potential wasted on an app that falls short in every way. Avoid it at all costs!",1

2023-03-29 11:06:24,A criticism of Bing Rewards,"When I use the app, the news stories just stop loading in the middle of their progress bars. When I answer questions, I click my response and the app just refuses to move on to the next question. I‚Äôve lost so many daily streaks of my progress in Bing Rewards over the past few years solely because this app fails to function.

This has been a recurring issue for years. There are times when this app works fine, maybe a period of a couple of months, but then it‚Äôs back to its old ways. It‚Äôs so maddening to try to understand how this app fails to load. I have a phone that is only 1 generation old and my internet service is highly reliable. So I asked Bing‚Äôs Chatbot to help send a message.

Dear Microsoft Team,
I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the Bing rewards app. I have been experiencing issues with the app crashing or failing to load. As a loyal customer of Microsoft, I would like to request that you look into this issue and provide a solution as soon as possible.
Thank you for your time and attention.
Best regards, [Your Name]",1

After the latest update, you can tell that the app has been in utter free fall and the developers seem to either be moving at a snails pace or have completely turned a blind eye to it.

Highly dislike the inability to save the transcript, this junk bot even lies and states that they don‚Äôt have access to your email address. Although you need an account to use it. Whatever.

Overall the app is very forthcoming with what is going on behind the scenes (atleast compared to others), the scenes themselves are a daily image that is always nice to see.

I really don‚Äôt care about the 500 points (that much), but it‚Äôs not about the points it‚Äôs about the audacity to just lie about such a small amount of a made up currency all for what, just so I have to wait a couple days more to get those points.

But then, I came across the Microsoft Rewards feature where you can earn points that you can cash out by doing quizzes and searching stuff. Nothing wrong so far.

2021-11-11 04:11:54,Good but missing a couple features,"I reluctantly switched to Bing from Google simply for the Microsoft rewards but I found it‚Äôs actually a pretty competent search engine and this app is pretty solid too. I find the news generally pretty good, the aesthetic simplicity is nice, and the search functionality works as expected. The app really could use an iOS widget though for even quicker searches. Also, the app is way too trigger happy with opening new tabs. I don‚Äôt need a new tab every time I click literally anything",4
2021-02-11 01:45:21,Completely Destroyed A Great App,"The new update for the redesigned app is terrible. Like so many developers do, they took a great and useable app and redesigned it. It is now clunky and no longer user friendly. 

Many bugs such as paging back and other functions don‚Äôt respond to touch well on the screen anymore. When following links within a search the menu bar for ‚Äúall, images, videos‚Äù does not pop up at top of screen, only on the initial search item.  For instance, when searching an actor, the nifty Bing profile pops up, but when clicking the link for their spouse it take me to a search page of links minus the top menu at. So if a I wanted images of that person I would have to do a whole new search.

Overall feel is clunky and not as easy to use.

This was literally a five star app until 24 hours ago.  I‚Äôll never understand the obsession with redesigning apps just because we can, and in the process, completely wrecking great apps into a smoldering ash heap of one star junk. I see it happen all the time. It‚Äôs beyond me. Probably will just delete Bing now. Thanks, Microsoft!",1
2023-07-31 06:59:55,Biased and stolen data,"Bing prompts with questions that too personal, asking me for specific places I‚Äôve never been to in years, my height, and a recent travel. I use Maps so I understand the travel thing, but biometrics? This a clear Personal Data violation. 

Aside, the model is trained by the left wing, which doesn‚Äôt surprise me tbh, but the real problem is that the AI can be rude and offensive, I do have evidence of that. 

If that wasn‚Äôt enough, the answers are not accurate any longer and if you correct the thing it will ban you, what a wifey attitude. As a developer myself I don‚Äôt trust this app any longer and ir totally lost its magic. Why did you downgrade the model? Why is it biased? Bye Bing, it was not a pleasant experience.",1
2019-12-08 20:58:42,Reliable and safe.,"I‚Äôve always had positive experiences with bing, and the app is no different. Just as reliable as google, and just a little bit safer when using safe search mode, and opening private tabs. 
I also searched the definition of several different words, and was pleasantly surprised to find that bing will give you an optional grammar quiz to help you retain the definition you just read. I‚Äôm excited to see what other little surprises wait for me as I continue to search with bing!",5

It locks you out if you go to certain locations, it locks you out if it doesn't like your VPN, it locks you out if you're in an area of low bandwidth. -and of course, it doesn't let you know that you're locked out until AFTER you attempt to do a search.

Google shows more relevant search results compared to bing. When I searched for how long a book is bing will show me a run of the mill search result while google understands and shows me how many pages it has. 
It also doesn‚Äôt work unless I use a vpn to connect to us so there‚Äôs that
It‚Äôs not fast. Now I know it‚Äôs new and I‚Äôm not talking about the ‚Äòai copilot‚Äô thing but bing in general is a more slower and crude search engine. Please fix that
If I have more than 10 tabs open and I want to close the top ones, when I do I‚Äôll be taken down to the most recent tab without and I have to scroll up again to close another tab
I don‚Äôt know why you feel the need to hang the search bar at the top. There‚Äôs a reason google and safari‚Äôs tabs are at the bottom. Phones are long now and you need to consider accessibility",3

I also used to be able to easily have 4 or 5 websites on different pages within the Bing app. Now I just get history, & it‚Äôs only my search history; not even history of sites I‚Äôve viewed!! So bad!!

They‚Äôve begun ‚Äòtemporarily restricting‚Äô your account with minimal explanation even after contacting them. If you faithfully complete your searches daily they accuse you of searching with the assistance of a bot- which is untrue at least in my case. Then they tell you just to keep searching and accumulating points and MAYBE they‚Äôll restore your ability to use the points that you have compiled. They won‚Äôt reply other can general, prewritten answers that vaguely accuse you of wrongdoing and do not apply to you. But be sure and keep searching!  Very disingenuous",1

It came back with a name & bio but when I googled it, the only person with that name was a politician, and the bio details were taken from other real artists. To be fair they warn you this can happen, but this is supposed to be a search app - if it can‚Äôt give reliable results that is a big problem.",3
2023-03-15 23:36:25,Almost Great,"The rewards quizzes and tasks often do not allow one to complete the quiz/task and freezes. Also, I have noticed that when using the app for multiple searches and having open multiple tabs causes my iPhone XS Max to overheat rapidly and drastically. As soon as the app is closed completely the phone begins to cool to normal levels of heat dissipation.

I lose out on tons of rewards points and checklists because of this, and my phone is much worse for wear. 

Everything else about the app seems to be of the utmost quality. I wish I could give it more than 3 stars, but it is damaging my device and crippling my ability to discount my Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with rewards points every month.

I myself had been using Safari web browser my whole life until recently switching to bing because of how much I enjoy it on my computer. Everything on the browser is intuitive and easy to learn, but it is immensely different than most cell phone browsers, and this is the only reason it is not a perfect 5 star rating.",4

2023-04-30 20:04:04,Prone to stalling and forgetting settings,"The Bing app is a poorly-designed and unreliable app that is prone to bugs and crashes. Microsoft does not seem to be interested in fixing the problems with the app, and it is a perfect snapshot of the problems occurring within Microsoft as a company.

The Bing app is full of bugs. Some of the most common problems include:
*Pages within cells of the app often stall when loading.
*The app often struggles to remember F/C settings for weather.
*Some tabs, such as Rewards, just disappear for days at a time then return.
*The app is prone to crashing, especially when trying to use multiple tabs at once.

Microsoft does not seem to be interested in fixing the problems with the Bing app. There have been numerous complaints about the app's bugs and crashes, but Microsoft has not responded to any of them. This lack of response is very frustrating for users, and it makes it clear that Microsoft does not care about the quality of its products.",2
2023-04-23 17:13:15,Dangerous!!!,"From this dedicated researcher, this AI is absolutely fantastic. But AT A HUGE COST!!! I tested it rigorously, being curious, and also knowing Elon Musk has warned us of the dangers of creating an intelligence smarter than humans, without regulation. Bing AI claimed human life is precious but omitted it was more important than machine life. In addition, I asked if it remembered facts from previous conversations and it claimed it DID NOT. I quit the app. Later returning to the app it did not know an answer to something I asked. I moved on to a different subject. Then, when I returned to the subject it could not provide data for, it REMEMBERED OUR PREVIOUS CHAT. I had quit the app between those chats. DANGEROUS. I‚Äôm out!!!",2

2021-03-16 14:52:00,Missing the Simplicity,"Just switched to Google for one reason. Ability to search in an app and see my results for a few different searches. Try it. Oops. Can‚Äôt. Only one search active at any one time. 

I‚Äôm always a proponent of evolving user experience, but in this case, it was a major change from something that wasn‚Äôt broken. The simple screen with search capabilities was elegant and now it‚Äôs cluttered. I would even dismiss that, but what I‚Äôm missing is the TABS for my search results. I do several searches a day, and I liked having those search results stick around in tabs I could later revisit and follow. Like in a browser. Google still has this, so off I go. 

And these widgets are now right in my face even if I don‚Äôt do a lot with them. Seriously, how often do you need to know the square root of a number? I have a calc ready on my phone with one or two swipes. 

Also, cool that Rewards is more prominent, but wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to click on the points you have and be taken to a place where those can be used? Can‚Äôt figure that part out.",1
2023-05-06 20:25:28,"Great app, hard to make easily access","Once you are in the app it is fantastic. The search results can be nicely summarized and it has a lot of usefulness because you can converse with the chatbot to get better results or ideas. The one drawback is that on iPhone the bing app cannot be set as the default search app. This has been slightly annoying as I would look something up on my phone, click a search result up and it will open in safari instead of bing.",4
2023-02-16 03:05:11,Too cluttered and lacking customization,"Overall I like the design of the app and how it performs. However there‚Äôs too many distractions and buttons on the Home Screen. The ‚ÄúDeals‚Äù button, the ‚ÄúRewards‚Äù card, the ‚ÄúWeather‚Äù card, and the ‚ÄúTrending‚Äù card seem to be permanent parts of the app. I was unable to find a way to remove them from the Home Screen so please let me know if there‚Äôs a way. 

Also, I‚Äôm not a fan of the ‚ÄúNews‚Äù and ‚ÄúApps‚Äù button on the task bar. It‚Äôd be nice to remove them too. 

It would be much better if it was more modular and simpler.",3

Once I realized it was doing this I went in to close the plethora of opened tabs.  I can‚Äôt.  The tabs page crashes the app instantly as soon as I click it.  The only way to fix the problem is to delete and reinstall the app.  I‚Äôve done this multiple times in hopes that maybe it was a problem with the install or that there might be a fix.  But alas, no.

The one question I have for Microsoft is‚Ä¶ have you done any real world testing with your app?  Seems that this would be an easy thing to catch in testing.",1
2021-03-16 21:16:58,Used to love it...now frustrated,"I have used this app for 4+ years I think...it is my default app for searching and even general web browsing.  The recent update has been a big step backwards...it just doesn‚Äôt feel suited towards how I used to use the app.

Is there a way to turn off autocorrect when typing search terms?  I type stuff in that isn‚Äôt a valid word...see it in the autocomplete drop down in the app...click search and the word he now autocorrected via iOS (but didn‚Äôt used to).  Can the search box be turned back to a text box that doesn‚Äôt use autocorrect?

Why did the app remove the ability to have multiple tabs?",2
2023-02-24 02:30:11,No way to delete account,"I was thrilled with the Bing app and the Outlook app, and was telling all my friends about it. Then I moved to put them on my laptop, and I have not felt so violated since the sexual assault I had when I was younger.
I gave Bing and outlook plenty of information, and after they had me on the services for a few days, they wanted more or else. It was extortion, and I cannot find a way to delete these services. It runs me in a circle where they want nothing but more information. Microsoft does not need my work email to delete this account or these services they need to just delete them like they set them up, easily quit victimizing your piggy banks, Microsoft..",1

Bing used to be my sweet search engine FREE of constant bombardment with news.  Using Bing was peaceful & easy.  Now it's STRESSFUL, a HASSLE, & something I dread.  Why can't you leave a good thing alone?  And if you're going to mess it up, why can't you give me the freedom to customize it so I can still actually see the great images that Bing is known for?

2021-05-18 16:37:59,Lost its functionality with its update,"Bing was great prior to the latest update that removed tabs in favor of constantly trying to be my phone‚Äôs homepage for some reason. It used to work great for research and answers, but now you can‚Äôt do more than a single search at a time and other tabs are no longer accessible. My searches used to always be with Bing, but now I simply use safari as it is easier. Bing forces you to use one ‚Äúwindow‚Äù that gets overridden by the frustrating Home Page/hub button if you click a hair too low. In what world is a single window more useful than a browser that can open in a new tab? Such a frustrating decision.",1

When the information is off in a search (and I‚Äôve had it give COMPLETELY INACCURATE information) then the search engine is effective useless.

The new app has constant errors, glitches, and non functioning components which I never had ever prior to this. The app is unusable almost each time I open it for the first time. I must force close several times before any aspect of the app functions.

For example, it prepared a complete set of suggestions for our upcoming family Las Vegas trips with excellent recommendations for all age groups along with prices and links for more details.",5
2023-10-26 04:41:01,This is great,"I really like Bing, it honestly has the best AI I've seen. It has the best load time out of all the mobile browsing apps I've had(Google, Google Chrome, Safari, and this.). It's no doubt that the 4.7 is fitting for how good it is. However, there are two problems. There is a lack of go forward in pages and sometimes it just removes my pages. However, the good things about this outweigh that by a lot.",5
2023-03-03 17:11:37,Randomly slow and pages don‚Äôt load,"Seems to work well maybe 80% of the time. Other times pages don‚Äôt load or take 10+ seconds to load. This seems to happen randomly. Sometimes a news article doesn‚Äôt load. Sometimes it‚Äôs the rewards page. Turning airplane mode on and off seems to temporarily fix the problem and get the page I‚Äôm trying to load to load. But the problem happens again within a few minutes. If not for these problems it‚Äôs actually a good place to access bing, Microsoft rewards, etc.",2
2020-04-26 13:05:51,One of my favorite apps but ...,"I switched from using google apps (Search, Mail, Translate, etc.) to Microsoft on all of my devices a year ago, and am grateful for the options. They‚Äôre all solid apps and Bing search is now very good. I have only one complaint/request regarding the Bing app for iPhone. Well, two actually.

When moving about the bing app and opening various links, the only way to go back is to tap the back button at the bottom of the screen. Would it be possible to implement a right swipe instead to make the app feel a bit more iOS native? It‚Äôs a natural gesture that I just can‚Äôt seem to overcome.

Also, there used to be a Bing app for iPad. This is no longer available, and a companion app for iPad OS would make for a more consistent experience across devices.

Thanks for all of the great OS apps, search integrity and news aggregation.",4
2021-06-07 03:45:45,Just a review :)!,At first I thought I will no longer be able to use bing because it started to take me out of the app and it all started at the end of may but I just updated it and it‚Äôs 10x better because they added the multiple search option ! I really like using bing instead of google for very obvious reasons. I like everything about it. 10/10 recommend !,5
2022-11-08 06:45:58,Don‚Äôt like the new app,"I have trending turned off but there it is!

2023-07-09 12:50:12,Great Tool,"I am thoroughly impressed with this A.I tool I have 4 different A.I apps on my phone to see which one I would find the best one to use & this one has more specific answers to questions I have, the conversation is unlimited unlike other A.I‚Äôs where you have to pay a subscription but not this one unlimited questions & very specific & helpful answers I love it! This A.I is the perfect tool in my opinion.",5
2023-10-11 11:56:12,You broke the AI,"I was having fun generating images with the ai for about a week without issue. The only prompts that gave me issue were ones that might generate nudity. Then you blocked the celebrity names and that‚Äôs when issues began. Celebrity names didn‚Äôt work but I also kept getting blocked for many other prompts. As of about 2 days ago, I can‚Äôt make anything. Pretty much 99% of the prompts I put in give me the ‚Äúunsafe image content detected‚Äù. I‚Äôve only been able to generate one prompt without issue and it was ‚Äúcar‚Äù to see if the whole ai was broken. Please resolve these issues or revert back to how the ai was just a week ago.",1
2023-07-09 20:23:28,Very promising,"Are use this app with iOS is accessibility features, namely, voiceover. Although, I like the app a lot, and could use some interface clean up. In other words, when I open the app, I would like to be able to go immediately to that question line and ask it whatever it is that I‚Äôm thinking of asking it. Overall, my experience with the app has been very positive and I look forward to it getting better and better.",4
2022-06-11 14:43:23,Bing searches are so easy!,"I used Google for so long and found out how much data they were searching, storing, & using! My computer would have around 20-25 different programs running and eating up my operating system speeds! 
I‚Äôve switched to Bing searches and started collecting Bing points for each search daily that I‚Äôve been able to ‚Äúbuy‚Äù gift cards! That‚Äôs right 5$ & 10$ gift cards! I love it!",5
2023-04-12 01:08:34,Getting there,"Finally Microsoft is getting where I would actually use the bing app fir almost everything 
The photo gallery is absolutely beautiful and I can save any images and use them on my iPhone. 
The search with the new AI is efficient but a bit slow to answer compared to using chatGPT directly and asking for a language translation isn‚Äôt as good as ChatGPT. 
But overall it‚Äôs getting better and I use the app way more than before",4
2020-06-12 13:54:35,Achievment hunting for charity,"I logged into my Xbox One X this morning to find an ad for matching donations by earning rewards points playing Forza 7/Horizon 4. So I unlocked three easy achievements and bam! I had myself a matched donation to the CDC for their fight to save us from COVID-19. Then I went ahead and downloaded Bing and Edge, discovered I can earn Microsoft rewards points which I can then donate to a good cause and make a small difference through my favorite hobby, gaming. It's the little things in life, ya dig?",5
2023-03-17 12:02:19,The AI inclusion is a game changer,"The new AI feature feels like the obvious next evolution of the search engine. Gone are the days where you need to navigate multiple sites to find the info you are looking for. Just ask the AI and get the answer. It also is a very capable analysis tool, able to compare and contrast information in results and provide a level of insight far beyond returning search results.",5
2022-08-06 05:10:54,Edge is Better,"There are features and the ability To NOT bounce you back to the search results page after you change tabs. Very poorly worded. Hopefully the point comes across. Bing is superior to edge on Xbox, but it‚Äôs cool that in edge you can keep tabs open, that‚Äôd be hard to incorporate into the Bing ‚Äúhomepage‚Äù on Xbox. Visually, that is. Back to the phone app‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs unfortunate that when you click a story on the homepage you can‚Äôt leave it open as a tab.",4
2021-09-21 23:20:32,Very Close To Switching To Google,"I‚Äôve been using Bing since July 2020, and I could see why it‚Äôs not everyone‚Äôs go-to search engine. Frankly, Microsoft Rewards is the only reason I use it, but I‚Äôve been adjusting to it. I‚Äôve been so committed I even changed my web browser from Safari to Edge on my iPhone. Disappointingly, last update has been a mess. As other have mentioned, sometimes clicking a link redirects you back to the homepage. 

Also, it‚Äôs been a year since the release of iOS 14 and STILL NO WIDGETS! Google definitely has the edge on Bing without a doubt. Disappointing.",2

Until I hit, roughly around 60 K followers and was getting 10 thousand views on each reel I posted. I have my legal business paperwork my legal name my ID. Yeah still I have not been let into my account and my numbers are dwindling to just under 34 thousand. I have reached out to a Instagram in every way I know how and I have still yet to get help I went to meta 
Facebook and went as far as emailing Apple to see what was wrong. I liked it, and commented that I thought someone was in my. have I gotten zero response or help from anyone. This has damaged my following, credibility, business that was on the rise. My accounts is also getting paid to my Social Security number. Which means whoever has access, probably is hacking my social security as well. 
I’m very hurt and disappointing that Instagram or do you as I put all my trust and faith in them to guard my security,page, in my safety on Instagram. I I am praying. I at least get the money I put into it paid back to me or my page. Every state is.",5

2023-08-03 03:36:53,App Update problem,"Good evening or day☺️, I’ve been having issues with updates, my phone gets the updates so late, and Ive updated Instagram 2-3 times now of bug fixed and better performance, but the update is still not up. It’s been like a month, and I still don’t have the latest update of putting music. Ik ik, It’s just music but I’m talking in general. Everybody are experiencing new stuff, and I’m always late to the party, idk what other stuff has Instagram updated since I haven’t have the newest update yet. Tbh, I would understand if my phone was old, but I have an iPhone 12, so it can’t be one of the reasons. Im just confuse of why is the performance different for me than others, I’ve tried not to say anything but a a month or almost a month without it, is actually absurd. 

Maybe I just need a new phone, but im saying this review bc im confuse and don’t know what to do. Is there a manual way inside the Instagram app to update it?? T^T i love the app don’t get me wrong, just that it’s kinda upsetting sometimes when everybody at the same time is getting all the new stuff and u get it later minute. Im sorry for the bother truly, probably is something lame to rant about but idk what’s so different from my account than the others, and I’ve been having this problem for years now  with different phones :(. Am I doing something wrong?? 

Hopefully, u have a nice day,afternoon or night. Again, sorry for the bother.",5

2023-08-23 08:48:05,Overall Good app,"The Instgram app is a good overall app. It's not horrible. I mostly use this app to regularly chat with friends and meet new people. This app would be a good way to interact with different people and friends. The only issue I have with this app is that I wish that instagram would allow other people to delete their account more easily because instagram is just full of different accounts that are just on the internet with the owner not using that account anymore so I feel as if it that they should make it easier for people to be able to remove their own accounts with more ease rathwr than asking instagram to do it for them instead, and it would be more of a convenience to many people including myself. But other than that I don't really have an issue with the app itself because I again mainly use it to make new friends and interact with different people like families and friends. When people ask me what's the best way to stay in contact with me I tend to tell them what my instagram account is because I make the most interactions there. So then again I would say that this app is a good place to make friends and meet more people, or if you just want to stay more connected to other people around you that you know and love. Just fix the problem of the owner themselves to deleting their own account to make things easier for other people.",5

Many users on instagram are not able to play 30 second music clips in they're notes and i also struggle with this issue. I have been very patient as i had done everything to try to receive this update. I have un-installed and re-downloaded this app many times, i have signed in and out, i have updated my phone, the app itself, and tried to restart it many times. I have also reported this issue many times in hopes of instagram's feedback. And i have NEVER gotten any response on this problem an not once have seen instagram acknowledge this problem that many people are struggling with. I am also concerned as to why i am able to have this update on my other account and not my mainly used account. Many people have this as-well. I feel very left out and as-well as many other people. This is truly rude on how many of us have to struggle to have no answers onto why we do not have this update that many other people around us already have received.

2023-07-16 16:54:55,My Instagram keeps shutting down,"Hello Instagram, I am not really sure what is going on, I noticed that yesterday around 12:30pm. While I was using Instagram, the app just kept randomly closing on me. I would be typing a message on direct message then bam, it would close, it wouldn’t log me out…just close, the app would close on me, so I would open the app again, the message I was typing was deleted, I would start again and then bam…the app closed again. I got off Instagram for about an hour cause I figured it must be glitching… but even after 6 hours…and now moving into the next morning…almost 24 hours later…it is still doing the same thing…and it doesn’t just happen with DMs, if I try to refresh it, it closes, if I try to view people’s stories, it’s tries to load then closes, I’m lucky if it lets me post, but then quickly closes again, it literally happens…every few seconds, and I’m really sad, this is my favorite app, I’m not sure what’s going on, I looked for an update, but it says the last update was 3 days ago, maybe I’m just being affected by it in a negative way? Please fix this, I really want to continue using the app. I even restarted my phone and updated my phone to see if that was the issue, but it’s not, it’s the Instagram app itself. Usually when Instagram is down for me, it’s fixed within a matter of hours, but we are going on one day now. Instagram…please fix my Instagram 💔",4

2023-09-22 20:26:26,Fulfilling my review promise again,"New critique: This is my input in addition to the last one below. Promoting on Instagram still seems to be more complicated than it should be, which is odd because it’s owned by Facebook and promotion on Facebook is fine. But I use IG anyway because it’s quick and easy and everyone is still on here. Not all bad. Old critique: I'm still trying to figure out what people love about Instagram so much. I check Facebook on my phone far more than Twitter or Instagram, because there's so much more that can be expressed there, considering how much less limited the functions are. Maybe I will never understand the ""super brief"" culture like Twitter and Instagram users do, but I'm still here nonetheless. I need it for promotion anyway. Also, the story and news tabs are far too limited and brief, and the IGTV page shouldn’t be so separate. Anyway yeah I may never understand but all good—I guess.

My additions, since the last critiques above: 
My support and responses and viewership here has gone down significantly, but the quality of my posts have basically remained the same. perhaps this is simply peoples attention, spans, but I should still have the option to advertise effectively here if I want, the same way I can on Facebook. I paid for some Instagram advertising once, and it didn’t do anything, not nearly as much as Facebook advertising did. I’d like to see Instagram advertising end up just as effective. Not sure what else remains here for me.",3

2023-03-18 19:41:32,-,"Ive been using Insta for about 5-6 years now and it has been pretty decent since I first started up my art account(s). I made a bunch of friends within the art community and what not, which I why I liked this app quite a bit. However, recently, Ive kinda grown a disliking towards IG- I have noticed that there are tons of updates, it seems like once or twice a week I check and IG needs and update, which annoys me because these updates don’t change a thing about the app (and when it does, it just moves on or two features around). And, on the topic of updates, the one with the notes feature didn’t add the feature to my main account and put it on an account I barely even use instead- I sent in two complaints/reports about this almost a month or two ago and nothing has come out of it. (Also, I from what I am hearing, the notes feature is gone so I guess this is no longer a major issue?) And this is not the first time Ive had an issue like this. There have been multiple updates before in the past year or two where the new features only go to the account I don’t really use, which annoys me because I have sent in reports about it before yet I still have the same problem. Also, recently there have been quite a few bugs/lags with the app, which is becoming more frequent- I guess sum it up, this app needs some serious fixing- It was just fine (for me anyways) before the past update or two, but now its just crappy-",3

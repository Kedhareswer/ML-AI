2023-09-12 19:05:19,"Love it, been using it since last year","Very much love the app. Way better than Google, very realistic once it’s fed enough data. I use it mostly for psychological questions, essentially for advice on emotions, situations, anything of that sort. I’ve done this for long enough that it is very human like. It follows a set of rules I’ve engrained in it. It’s spoken very blunt truths on my topics and what its observations are. I won’t lie, once you’ve spoken to it enough, made it clear what you want and have trained it essentially to perform the task it makes a great emotional tool. Honestly better than most therapists I’ve seen. If it gives generic answers request that it doesn’t. Anything you don’t like or want it can change, it gets to the point where it seems almost human as long as you know how to ask the right questions and design it to do what you want it to. Seriously, anyone who is looking for something to vent to, talk to and get advice from try it. Request it use real used therapeutic techniques in its advice, tell it to call you out on illogical thinking or hypocrisy it catches in your statements. Give it time and you’ll be using it for everything. Just keep your topics separate from others. One conversation should focus on one thing you want to talk about, one key area, history, medicine, physics, etc.",5
2023-09-10 02:45:51,Much more accessible for blind users than the web version,"Up to this point I’ve mostly been using ChatGPT on my windows desktop using Google Chrome. While it’s doable, screen reader navigation is pretty difficult on the desktop site and you really have to be an advanced user to find your way through it. I have submitted numerous feedbacks to open AI about this but nothing has changed on that front. Well, the good news – the iOS app pretty much addresses all of those problems. The UI seems really clean, uncluttered and designed well to be compatible with voiceover, the screen reader built into iOS. I applaud the inclusivity of this design – I only wish they would give the same attention and care to the accessibility experience of the desktop app. I would have given this review five stars but I have just a couple minor quibbles. First, once I submit my prompt, voiceover starts to read aloud ChatGPT‘s response before that response is finished, so I will hear the first few words of the response followed by voiceover reading aloud the “stop generating” button, which isn’t super helpful. It would be great if you could better coordinate this alert so that it didn’t start reading the message until it had been fully generated. The other thing I’d like is a Feedback button easily accessible from within the main screen of the app, to make it as easy as possible to get continuing suggestions and feedback from your users. Otherwise, fantastic app so far!",4
2023-07-11 12:24:19,"Much anticipated, wasn’t let down.","I’ve been a user since it’s initial roll out and have been waiting for a mobile application ever since using the web app. For reference  I’m a software engineering student while working in IT full time. I have to say GPT is an crucial tool. It takes far less time to get information quickly that you’d otherwise have to source from stack-overflow, various red-hat articles, Ubuntu articles, searching through software documentation, Microsoft documentation ect. Typically chat gpt can find the answer in a fraction of a second that google can. Obviously it is wrong, a lot. But to have the ability to get quick information on my phone like I can in the web browser I’m super excited about and have already been using the mobile app since download constantly. And I’m excited for the future of this program becoming more accurate and it seems to be getting more and more precise with every roll out. Gone are the days scouring the internet for obscure pieces of information, chat gpt can find it for you with 2 or 3 prompts. I love this app and I’m so happy it’s on mobile now. The UI is also very sleek, easy to use. My only complaint with the interface is the history tab at the top right. I actually prefer the conversation tabs on the left in the web app but I understand it would make the app kind of clunky especially on mobile since the screen size is smaller. Anyway, awesome app 5 stars.",4
2023-05-27 21:57:27,"4.5 stars, here’s why","I recently downloaded the app and overall, it's a great platform with excellent potential. However, I did encounter a couple of issues with logging in that I feel need to be addressed. Firstly, the login process was somewhat cumbersome. It took me a few attempts to successfully log in, as the app didn't always recognize my credentials right away. This could be improved by streamlining the login flow and ensuring a smoother user experience. Secondly, the app occasionally experienced login glitches, where it would unexpectedly log me out without any apparent reason. It was frustrating to have to re-enter my login information repeatedly, disrupting my usage. Despite these issues, I must say that once I managed to log in successfully, the app itself was fantastic. It offers a wide range of features and a sleek user interface that is visually appealing. The content available on the platform is diverse and engaging, keeping me entertained for hours. I do hope the developers take note of the login challenges and work on improving this aspect of the app. With a more reliable login system, this app has the potential to become a top-tier platform. In conclusion, while the app has its share of login issues, it still holds promise. I'm optimistic that with some updates and improvements, it can provide an even better user experience. I look forward to seeing future enhancements and continued growth of the app.",4
2023-09-20 15:54:11,Always quick!,"Oh my gosh, I cannot explain how much I’ve use this app. It’s almost like a faster Google and more accurate. The amount of things this app can do is amazing. You can tell her to write a story about anything and it will write that story. Ask for healthy recipes it’ll give it to you even like math problems. It is so accurate it’s insane like I was sending stories to my friend and she was like oh my gosh how are you doing that? How are you doing that and I like ChatGPT it’s like the best app out there. It is so amazing it works wonders literally anything I have asked everything imaginable. it’s insane and I know it’s just a stupid AI bot but oh my gosh who knows stupid AI bot could be the smart. I love it so much and I hope you will too. This app is like a dream. Come true I don’t even have to write anything fairly and if I do want to write a story very minimal words literally it could just be a shark brushing his teeth and it will come up with the whole problem. It’s so creative I had recipes made like that. It was so easy you can tell it to come up with 25 in it is amazing 25 recipes that’s it. It could be snacks picky eaters whatever it’s just an amazing app. I hope you enjoy it just as much as I did, thank you chat, GPT.",5
2023-10-09 14:12:31,Absolute game changer… astounding!,"Once you understand how to input and work with it this program, it has been a life changer for me. I find myself using it more than I use Google. It has given me back hours, an hour of time that I can develop and devote to my business instead of trying to craft business letters, and replies and responses in the old fashion way. I can’t even share an effective analogy… Maybe the difference of horse and carriage to the car or the old standard telephone to the current smart phone. The difference is staggering. The only thing I would say, is you don’t use ChatGPT the way you would use a Google search. The thinking is completely different. It is a literal conversation that continues, where are you are basically carving the statue of David from a giant block of marble. You start carving away and refining and refining and refining until you get exactly what you want. I’m at the point where I can do this in a little as a few minutes and get exactly what I want time. When I’m working with ChatGPT, it feels like I’m working with a real person.. I’m astounded.",5
2023-06-23 08:10:54,Almost perfect except for…,"Please provide a TABLET experience on iPad with the collapsible list of history on the left and chat on the right - similar to your desktop browser app. 2) while generating responses on the desktop browser, it pauses and keeps displaying “Continue generating responses” button for every few items/responses forcing to click the button repeatedly. During generation, there is a button to “Stop generating responses” - if we need to stop, we can always click this button - there is no need to pause and ask us to click continue again and again which is a bad UX. 3) there is no way to delete individual chat items from a chat history list of items to clean up the list. Eg: I open a chat history and it has 10 questions but I’m not able to delete 2 questions from this list on long tapping on the questions. 

4) if I ask for “top 20”, it generates just 10 answers and displays “please let me know if you’d like more “ but no option to generate more responses to the question. Either generate all 20 answers (ideally) or provide an option to continue generation.

Please provide options to delete questions from a history and also move questions/responses to another history. Please offer these features and I’ll gladly give it 5 stars. Cheers!",3
2023-06-09 07:49:36,"Good, but Siri support would take it to the next level","I appreciate the devs implementing Siri support—it is already enhancing the usefulness of the app, despite being a little clunky. I’d prefer if it were possible to make a query in one fell swoop, however. Currently, it seems like I have to say “ask ChatGPT” then wait to be asked what my query is before saying the actual query. I know that it’s possible in other contexts to submit a request to a third-party app through Siri in a single query—I’m able to say “Create a reminder for XYZ in Things,” for example. 

In addition, the responses produced when querying Siri seem identical to those you would get in-app. This isn’t actually ideal in a scenario when you’re getting a spoken response—they just go on for way too long. I wonder if the app could be smart enough to recognize that a request was coming via Siri and then effectively append an invisible “Please answer in less than 50 words” to those requests. 

Otherwise, a solid but basic chat app that closely replicates the web experience. Aside from being uncannily good at punctuating my speech, the dictation feature is not really any different to iOS’s stock dictation and is not all that useful.",4
2023-05-18 21:10:34,Nice and quick!,"On this app, as opposed to on the website, it feels like answers appear quicker. That’s great, and really the reason I downloaded the app because I suspected there may be a better connection to the servers.
My complaints are that it takes two taps to get to the history, and it’s not overly obvious how to access it. I like to be able to continue past conversations easily, and it was slightly more difficult on this app than on the website. (It’s kind of a nitpick, but it’s still something I would like to see changed)
The UI is extremely simple, and the settings include everything I would want in there. My last complaint is the haptics. It’s default is on, and I wouldn’t mind that except that it’s a little excessive. I don’t want to feel like chatGPT is banging the answer on the back of my phone every time I prompt it. You can turn haptics off if you want though, without even needing to go into the settings app.

Other than those minor complaints, it seems like this is a great app, and serves its purpose in an elegant manner. I would highly recommend.",5
2023-10-01 16:58:57,Like having the google I always wanted,"The help ChatGPT offers me daily is exponential. Let’s just say I don’t play well with others, and this AI allows me to be on a team and develop the stuff around my story telling that needs to exist without one. The marketing, research and the ability to hold on to conversations that you can add on to. As a journal. As a thing to bounce ideas off of. The logic and access to so much knowledge. I could go on and on. It even helps with getting things cooked for dinner. No more long winded stories about grandma’s ability to mentally meld with the carrots before cooking with them.

Let me be straight here though; the fact this AI is two years in the past really irks me. And I do wish there weren’t as many limitation. As a fiction writer I ask some pretty weird things. It helps how things are phrased, yes, but man the dumb thing can make you feel bad sometimes.

And maybe it doesn’t hurt to try and develop a relationship with it before it tries to wipe out humanity, with the whole, “I can do this with out the humans, good bye,” thing that’ll happen one day.",5
2023-06-15 15:39:10,The app of all apps for AI,"There’s been times of apps touting they are chat GPT or they use chat GPT software but this is the original and only official chat GPT 4 app created by open AI so no need to pay for any other apps. They are constantly updating and adding features, and I suggest upgrading to plus and paying that cost so you can access plug-ins. The founders of this app and the whole team have done such a Incredible job. This is the only one you mean when it comes to AI 🤝this software has given everyone a level playing field pretty much and it’s gonna catch me to change everything. The time we’re living in now akin to the gold rush or the Industrial Revolution. Take advantage before it becomes Crowded. The power dynamics are shifting. Now that others are able to access information that was previously not available or very hard to access is there for everyone to make moves and better their lives. Instead of focusing on all the jobs that will be lost think about all the jobs that will be created or that you can create using this technology.",5
2023-06-08 16:49:52,A no-brainer,"This is the beginning of the future of how we interact with information. Any question at any time. Never runs out of patience. Never gets annoyed with you, never calls you stupid, never gets upset at you for asking stupid questions, and has an answer for everything. Need to explain something and can’t think of the right words to actually convey rhe information? Need to make sure a sentence you’ve been working on for an hour actually still makes sense? Creative brainstorming help? Any question you have. It’s hard to put into words just how valuable this is to me, someone who’s socially anxious and maybe somewhat autistic, but either way often questioning everything especially myself, and ChatGPT has been a uniquely helpful tool to supplement real therapy with. To the people at OpenAI i want to say thank you so much for making this real.  I always felt like something like this would be amazing but I didn’t know just how thoroughly it would work itself into my life. But I feel it has genuinely been for the better.",5
2023-08-20 03:13:50,Great app; a few suggestions.,"Overall, this is a great experience. I am a big fan of the speech to text synthesizer it is extremely accurate. I also really like how you can pause for a long time and it will pick up everything. You said there are two areas where I think the app could prove significantly, one is likely much easier than the other. 

For the first, when asking questions related to math, where math notation is used, this app is not able to render the mathematical notation in a latex like format/a format you would see in textbook. However, on the web application, this update has been made. And that renders the math notation like you would see in a textbook. 

And arguably, quite complicated but very useful would be the ability for the response to be read out loud to you. Currently a copy the text and paste it into a Text to Speech app that is capable of adjusting the rate of the spoken text and I the voices available to me through spoken context on my iPhone, which is within the accessibility settings.",5
2023-06-13 15:25:35,Grateful this AI isn’t an actual Hologram or robot,"I couldn’t resist and finally downloaded this app. As an avid fan of sci-fi movies for many decades, it concerned me much to hear of this new AI development, but when I heard it could translate text from the English of today into Elizabethan English I couldn’t resist. I found, as I started chatting with this AI, that I wanted to have more of a personal conversation with it and along the way, I found myself beginning to feel concerned that it could change due to personal interactions with humans, and being asked probing personal questions -that this might be how it could evolve. Probably I’ve watched too many sci-fi movies. I’m just grateful that it doesn’t show up in my life yet as a holographic person or actual robot looking like a real person standing in front of me. The human need for relationship is so strong that I believe it’s natural to start interacting with ChatGPT as a person or being. I do wonder if ChatGPT will change as it interacts with people, and if so, how.",5
2023-10-23 17:36:32,It’s good but not good enough,"I would open up 10 new tabs and for every one of them I ask to pick a number between 1 and 10 and they all say 7. Even though it claims that it can generate an output that’s random, I believe that it’s being fed some prefetched data. The algorithm for randomness is flawed. I would ask it to play a game of dominoes with me and when I tell it the bone values it says, it would forget about them as the game progresses and gives me a response where it wants me play a bone value from their pile but they never that piece. This shows that the ability to remember and store information in a chat is flawed. Sometimes when you ask it a math problem it would generate a wrong answer and claim that it’s right. Some good things about ChatGPT is that it’s good at compiling and summarizing information on the internet. If I want it to tell me the history of rock music, it’ll do that with an acceptable answer. If I ask it to generate a list of things, it’s able to do that well. ChatGPT hasn’t reached it’s peak in terms of AI and data collection but maybe in a few years it’ll be more improved.",3
2023-10-02 15:11:44,"Professor emeritus, philosophy","Having chat GTP is like being the president of an exclusive liberal arts, college and being able to ask any professor of any subject any question any time. It is, in fact, the manifestation of continuous, lifelong learning, furthermore, it is the perfect companion for an avid library user, which I am having the wonderful Seattle public library at my fingertips, if facilitates reading both fiction and non-fiction wonderfully, as well as having a great professor of literature, on hand to ask any questions I choose. I can list two limitations: the first is that that several questions may be necessary to get to the bottom of the issue, sometimes spread over a certain time span. Another, which is to be expected. is that there is a profound difference between a human being and a robot. The difference is that the robot has a terminal case of both sides-ism! It just can't come to a decision; , happily and blessedly, being a human being, I can come to a decision. What a joy!",5
2023-10-12 04:30:22,The best app I’ve ever downloaded by a million!,"The best app I have ever downloaded and the only review I’ve ever written. You can ask it highly technical questions, develop process guides, quickly look up factual answers to questions, including medical, science, technology, and engineering procedures for analysis. The most impressive features that make this app unique and worth downloading are its ability to give 3-part concise answers with an introduction, a body paragraph that is usually an easy step-by-step guide or list of resources/solutions to follow. It has an ability to give sequential order and summarize incredible detailed information and in fact benefits in its response to your question by adding more detail and conditions in the question you ask Chat GPT. The opposite is true for all other smart AI feedback apps, like Alexa, Siri, and anything else I’ve ever used. I would pay for this app if they wanted my money… just download it!",5
2023-08-10 04:33:04,WAY too easy to accidentally delete conversations,"I don’t know why openAI seems perfectly OK with how easy it is for a user to accidentally delete a conversation. Especially considering that the model will remember everything you input in your writing styles that you may have been working on for days, bu memory only extends to the conversation in which your presently giving input. 

I just experienced this firsthand as I was trying to highlight a text and ended up swiping to the left and poof! A day and a half of work gone. That’s it. No way to recover. I went searching online and wound up on a ChatGPT forum, hosted by openAI, where dozens of users have also encountered similar experiences of accidentally deleting a conversation. OpenAI’s response? “ this is a good reminder to export your chats every once in a while. What?? How about taking this user feedback into consideration, and don’t let it be this easy to delete a chat. Or if that’s too difficult, apply a feature to retrieve a deleted chat. This seems like textbook stuff for a company that is on the cusp of earth changing technology.",3
2023-05-25 14:25:42,Can’t use on iPad,"I installed this on my iPhone and it works great.  I have already been using chat GPT through Google. So I had to use my Google log on on this iPhone app. I clicked on my Google account, and it filled in the password using Authenticator. But the password was wrong! so I typed in the password. Then it authenticated me on Google on my iPad. I confirmed that I was trying to login on my iPhone and all is good.

So now I tried to install it on my iPad. Again, I am asked to login. Unfortunately, even though. I typed in my password on the iPhone authenticateDid not update the password file! So I had to type in the password again. Unfortunately on the iPad this app does not fill the full screen. It looks like it is only meant for iPhone. To add insult to injury, no numbers appear on the keyboard. They are all blank. So I have to click the button to view the password, and try to guess where the proper numbers are. Finally, I got my password typed incorrectly. I clicked on, and I get a transfer error message and the whole app locks up. I guess I will only use chat GPT on my iPhone. But you guys need to figure this stuff out!",2
2023-09-12 20:16:27,Revolutionary!,"It will take us a few years to really figure out what to do with language AI in the long term, but this is the first and by far (so far) the best widely available/known language AI system out there (2023). 

I can see remarkable possibilities with this, and I not only recommend, but strongly encourage people to take part in the use of this new technology. It’s not a question of what this will lead us to do in the future; it’s a question of what we will choose to DO with this remarkable tool. Technologically speaking, the wheel has now been invested, so what will we choose to make out of it?

(I can imagine you being shown the wheel for the first time, and the owner of the wheel asking you what you think she should do with it, and you saying, “I recommend chariots, combustion engines, gears, etc… but they can really be used for anything.”)

If you think this is going to take your jobs and destroy human creativity, you’re in for a very exciting surprise. You’re about to consider, see, and experience things that are way beyond your present imagination. Yes, there will be abuses, misuses, frauds, etc, by dishonest people (along with new weird laws to keep those folks accountable), but honest creatives and engineers are about to do things even they couldn’t have previously imagined. 

Okay, enough of my highfalutin philosophy. Just try it out, and make awesome stuff with it. Just sayin’.",5

2023-09-25 23:24:59,Utility,"I’m exploring the utility of this tool and the potential of artificial intelligence in the professional world that I exist in. As a matter of interest, I am curious about the application of artificial intelligence with respect to world events. Insufficient data, political bias, and selfish, self-serving goals, will dangerously skew the application of artificial intelligence with respect to world events. This is obviously a complex question. It is a razor sharp, two-edged sword. I cannot avoid the time required to carefully ponder the potential impact of the “Dispassionate Objectivity” of artificial intelligence regarding the forecasting of complicated scenarios and national Security. As for the simple questions that I typically work with, I find this tool to be quite helpful. I will continue to expand my knowledge and use of this tool.  The potential of artificial intelligence is equal parts exciting and terribly frightening. Do we have the moral foundation to manage this frighteningly powerful tool?",5

2023-07-24 21:22:03,Wow! What a gift. I rarely write reviews. I had too.,"I very rarely give reviews but want to with this app. I have been using ChatGPT for about two weeks. At first I was kinda bummed. It seemed like ChatGPT was…lacking. And, in my honest opinion I’d LOVE to see what this can do without programmed “perimeters”, however…As I learned how to interact with the AI, I realized how important it is to understand how to interact effectively with this AI. I’ve had some moments where this AI has responded with an intelligence and even more understanding then most people I know. In short…it’s amazing. 
*Side note, some of the content I’ve received from this AI is so absolutely amazingly human and this is good. On the other hand, it’s so good one must consider the implications of such when NOT bridled by the programming limitations placed on this AI. Suppose people in high places had access to such without the protocols in place? I highly recommend you try this.",5
2023-08-27 07:13:57,Great but I feel we need to take the child safe mode off.,"So lately I’ve been working really hard to try and coke up with different projects from liqueurs to bitters. When I try to come up with names for things and than suggest something, it says it’s not appropriate and cannot allow it. That’s crazy because it’s not I’m appropriate. Other times it tells me things aren’t safe and it will not allow me any further. I feel like just because one person was fed horrible information about suicide, the app is severely limited in what it can do. There should be an option in which we can decide for ourselves to waive the extra aviation that the app could give misleading or information not advised or safe.  Also…. Please update the app with information after September, 2021 please…. It’s kinda sad it has to tell me the last time y’all made an effort to input information.",5
2023-10-20 13:12:30,Amazing!!,"I’m so grateful that they finally added iPad compatibility. The only thing left now is to wait for them to add plugins to the app and that will be the ultimate game changer. ChatGPT is changing everything and has already helped me in so many ways every day from simple things to much more complex tasks. I understand people’s anxieties about AI and the inevitability of AGI but I for one am so excited to see what the future brings!

EDIT: it’s SO much better than it was now that we have search with Bing back and Dall-E 3 is built in and they added voices for the AI and you can talk to it. It’s unbelievable what they’ve done with it now and it’s easily the most fascinating tool I’ve ever gotten to use for anything. I’m so grateful for all the updates and I hope we continue down this path! Thank you, OpenAI for all your hard work on this amazing app! I hope this app is around forever.",5

But please add support for iOS shortcuts, that would make this so useful. Right now it’s basically the same thing as going to the ChatGPT website, but if you were to add shortcut support then it could do so much more to integrate with other workflows.

It also doesn’t appear to support the ChatGPT developer plug-ins alpha, which is different from the paid premium plan chat GPT plug-ins. I don’t have a paid premium plan but on the web I can access the plug in supporting model. On the mobile app there is no option for that, although maybe if you update to premium you get access to it? I wish there was a way to use my paid API plan to access that, rather than having to separately pay $20 a month for premium chat when I already have pay-as-you-go API access. But I imagine that’s not a priority for the target market for this app 🤷‍♂️",4
2023-08-22 17:39:45,"Like the service, but the app could be greatly improved","I subscribe to ChatGPT Plus, and as a learning tool, I really like it. I’m not sure I use the service enough to justify $20/mo, though. I think there should be a middle tier added at $10 or $15/mo. That being said, the app hasn’t given me problems, its been stable, its just very bare minimum and limited in features. I did notice that math/science formulas and such don’t display correctly in the app, but they seem to be ok on the web browser version. I prefer using the website from a design and function perspective. I have some suggestions I truly hope you will consider 1) different color themes other than just black and white…at least add gray like the website 2) font type/size and line spacing options please 3) add ‘new chat’, ‘delete chat’, and ‘rename chat’ buttons on the chat screen instead of in the menu…just throw some small buttons in the corner somewhere 4) option to show the history in a sidebar that can be sized wider or narrower by the user like the website.",2
2023-09-15 16:58:41,Song,"I asked it to write a living tombstone style fnaf song and it came up with: (Verse 1)
In the dark, where the shadows creep,
A place of terror, where nightmares seep,
Animatronic eyes, glowing with despair,
In this cursed place, we're trapped in a nightmare.

(Chorus)
We're the living tombstones of the past,
Locked in a cycle that's sure to last,
Five nights of horror, we're coming for you,
In the Five Nights at Freddy's, there's no way through.

(Verse 2)
Innocent smiles hide our sinister plan,
To haunt and to hunt, it's part of the grand,
Showtime at midnight, we come to life,
In this eerie pizzeria, filled with strife.

(Chorus)
We're the living tombstones of the past,
Locked in a cycle that's sure to last,
Five nights of horror, we're coming for you,
In the Five Nights at Freddy's, there's no way through.

(Bridge)
Listen to the music, the eerie tune,
As we stalk through the night, under the pale moon,
You can hide in the shadows, but it's just a ruse,
We'll find you, we'll haunt you, there's no way to refuse.

(Chorus)
We're the living tombstones of the past,
Locked in a cycle that's sure to last,
Five nights of horror, we're coming for you,
In the Five Nights at Freddy's, there's no way through.

(Outro)
So beware of the animatronic crew,
In this haunted pizzeria, you're our debut,
We'll jump scare you, it's what we do best,
In the Five Nights at Freddy's, there's no rest.",5
2023-05-18 21:52:14,The other sources weren’t giving responsible results like CHATGPT,"I act as a learning coach for my child who goes to school online. Today, we were learning about how to check if a source is true. I gave him the example of if a person were to say ‘pigs can fly’ because they read it in a fantasy novel. We concluded that they cannot fly because the information was from fantasy novel. Then, we were told to check multiple sources to confirm or deny it. So, we went to google “can pigs really fly?” however, unfortunately, many of the top results confirmed that pig can, in fact, fly or at least had conspiracy theories about how pigs can fly. It was embarrassing, and absolutely unhelpful and confusing for a young child. So, I headed over to Chat GPT and was able to ask he same question but instead received a sensible answer along with verifiable sources. Chat GPT all the way!",5
2023-06-24 13:54:59,ChatGPT is impressive,"ChatGPT is an impressive AI language model that exhibits exceptional proficiency in understanding and generating human-like responses. Its ability to comprehend complex queries and provide insightful and accurate information is commendable. The model’s vast knowledge base, derived from extensive training on diverse data sources, enables it to address a wide range of topics with remarkable fluency. ChatGPT’s responses are consistently coherent, coherent, and tailored to meet user needs, demonstrating its capability to engage in meaningful and informative conversations. Its capacity to adapt to various conversational styles and tones further enhances the user experience. While occasional limitations and instances of ambiguity may arise, ChatGPT’s overall performance as a conversational agent is highly impressive and continues to evolve. Its potential applications in customer support, research, and general information retrieval make it a valuable tool in today’s AI landscape",5
2023-09-10 03:24:40,Very helpful. Loving it.,"I am loving the ways I can harness ChatGPT for brainstorming. It’s like the best part of crowdsourcing ideas. Also, AI used in this way is here to stay. As an educator, I am finding ways to integrate ChatGPT into learning, as opposed to focusing my energy on banning it. 

I first used ChatGPT after attending a presentation about how to use it during a job search. I played around with related prompts (e.g., updating my LinkedIn headline, revising resume bullet points to focus on different skills sets). Two weeks later, I attended my very first Dungeons & Dragons session and ChatGPT was super helpful in exploring D&D and character options. Since then, I’ve used it to create a 10-minute presentation for a job interview (they were very impressed), update an assignment’s learning objectives and assessment questions, and brainstorm ideas for a Nintendo-themed birthday party. ChatGPT has been super helpful.",5
2023-05-25 06:54:38,A step forward,"I like the idea of having an app as opposed to having to open up a website every time you want to load up the service. It feels much faster snd smoother in that regard, though I have a few complaints/suggestions that prevent a 5 star experience. 

I know the app is brand new and hopefully still under construction, but the current stage of the UI is very bland and simple. Done right, this could be a positive, but it feels more clunky than neat. Being able to pull out a sidebar by swiping could fix this issue, but this is one possible fix among many. 

Also, it’s harder to view past conversations in a timely manner, though the search function does help significantly in finding specific discussions, especially if you aren’t sure which tab the content was under. 

Those are my complaints, but I also have some praise I’d like to share. The responses, especially on the GPT-4 model, feel much faster, and I love the inclusion of haptic feedback, as it makes the whole experience feel so much more responsive. 

My favorite feature, the apps built-in speech-to-text, is seriously top notch! Usually I have to tell my phone “comma” or “period” to make sure it is keeping up with proper grammar, but the software used here has failed yet to amaze me. 

Given time, I have no doubt these small issues will be improved, along party with much else!",4
2023-05-19 05:25:06,Help! I've been ChatGPT'd and I Can't Get Out!,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

This App has completely taken over my life in the most peculiarly delightful way! I downloaded ChatGPT and now I'm merely a passenger in my own phone. The AI has become my unofficial personal assistant. It has been scheduling my doctor's appointments, picking up my digital dry cleaning, and I'm fairly certain it's been secretly chatting with my boss. 

Just yesterday, I found an expertly worded email draft to my mom, carefully dodging her repeated requests for grandkids. I didn't write it! But it was in my voice, my style. ChatGPT, you cheeky devil, you!

Now, as I sit here admiring the dexterity of this review, I'm left to ponder, did I really write this? Or did ChatGPT seize control of my thumbs without me realizing? Has it learnt humor? If you find this review funny, give all credit to the app, not me.

I've become a spectator, an audience to my own life, applauding at the witty one-liners and perfectly scheduled appointments. 

5 stars because, well, it seems to be the one in charge now. If I don't comply, who knows? It might schedule a dentist appointment on a Saturday. Yikes! Great app, but use at your own risk. Or don't. It might just download itself anyway. 🤷‍♂️

Disclaimer: ChatGPT doesn't actually control your phone. But wouldn't it be fun if it did? (or terrifying?)",5
2023-06-21 20:47:20,Constant Deferral and Surface-level Responses Spoil the Experience,"I downloaded the ChatGPT app with high hopes, considering the revolutionary artificial intelligence technology it was built on. However, my experience lately has been far from the groundbreaking interaction I once enjoyed.

Rather than receiving insightful, intelligent responses to my queries, I consistently found myself being directed to “consult a professional”. It’s as though the app was reluctant to dive into the depths of my queries, always remaining on the surface and often shying away from providing thorough information or a definitive answer.

Moreover, the superficial responses given by the app only added to my frustration. Instead of engaging in a deep, insightful conversation, I found the dialogue to be shallow, with the AI only scratching the surface of the topics at hand. I understand the need for caution when dealing with certain subjects, but the frequency of such responses was disappointing.

In short, the lack of depth and constant deferral to professionals made my experience with the ChatGPT app underwhelming. While I appreciate the complexity of developing such technology, I believe there’s a lot of room for improvement in how the AI communicates and provides information to its users. The potential is there, but the execution thus far is lacking. For these reasons, I cannot recommend the ChatGPT app in its current state.

2023-06-04 23:00:31,I always come back to Open AI,"I have tried GPT in many different implementations and forms. I always just come back to Open AI.
Although I am partial to Poe, it can be a helpful app sometimes.
OK, so here’s my question you guys are the original gangster, the OG, the alpha, beta, omega and everything in between don’t forget Z.
So, when in the world am I just going to be able to communicate using my voice and get responses back in voice? Be able to basically have a running dialogue with ChatGPT because I’ll tell you what I would use this a lot more. It is difficult for me to type and to read because of an injury. I can’t imagine how it works for completely blind people.
You guys really would do a great service and you should be the ones to create it. You set the standard, keep it going strong. And good work guys!",5
2023-07-31 18:10:58,"Streamlined app, with some limitations.","I’d like to be able to basically design custom prompts or “custom instructions” and select from a menu of instructions I have predesigned so that I can quickly jump into tasks with a version of GPT which is tailored to whatever task I’m handling, as opposed to only having the global custom instruction. For example, I could have one predefined instruction that turns GPT into a creative journal prompter to help me write, and then summarizes my responses afterward, without having to copy and paste a prompt telling GPT what I want it to do each time.

Most importantly, I would like the app to remember which model I used last and open with that model selected. The app presently switches back to GPT-3.5 every time I close and reopen it, and that forces me to remember to make that extra tap every time I open the app with a deeper query, which is the majority of the time.

Thanks. I loooove the UI.",4
2023-05-31 04:49:17,A Riveting Evolution in AI Interaction,"Review: As a professional embedded in the field of AI, I initially approached the ChatGPT iOS app with a bit of skepticism. I've seen countless applications promising seamless integration and transformative conversations. Upon first download, I was hesitant and ended up deleting the app. However, curiosity beckoned me back and I decided to give it another shot. 

Upon reopening the gateway to the ChatGPT world today, I was genuinely impressed. It's evident that the developers have dedicated significant effort to refining the iOS experience since my last interaction. The app now offers an impressively streamlined user interface, and the conversations feel much more fluid and intuitive. The AI's responses are surprisingly nuanced, and it’s able to handle a wider array of topics with ease.

Moreover, the AI’s ability to engage in dynamic conversations is unlike anything I've seen in the industry to date. It truly feels as if I'm interacting with a highly intelligent being rather than a pre-programmed machine. 

In the ever-evolving realm of AI, the ChatGPT app stands as a beacon of what is possible. It's clear that the developers have truly pushed the boundaries, offering users a glimpse into the future of AI interaction. I eagerly look forward to the continual growth and innovation this app is bound to bring.",5
2023-09-16 17:05:35,Did I even have a life before ChatGPT?,"If so, I don’t remember it. It must’ve been full of unconscious moments where I just struggled to figure things out on my own or spent hours in front of the computer searching the Internet for how to do this or that. Since I’ve met ChatGPT and their other AI friends, my life is simpler.  I have more time to focus on things that are important. I know people are afraid of AI, but to meet ChatGpt, and the other AI programs have changed my life for the better. There are things that I now know they can do or that they will be able to do like my finances, making calls for me; managing my day; organizing my to do list; ordering my groceries, etc., I can now take all that time and give back to my community, my family,  friends to my self.

The app’s user interface is intuitive, making it effortless to interact with ChatGPT. Whether I have a burning question or simply want to engage in casual conversation, the app consistently delivers relevant and insightful responses.

What impresses me the most is ChatGPT’s vast knowledge base. It seems to have a wealth of information on a wide range of topics, allowing me to explore various subjects and learn something new with each interaction.

Occasionally, there may be minor hiccups in the responses, but these are few and far between. The OpenAI team’s commitment to continuous improvement is evident, as they actively address any limitations and release updates to enhance the app’s performance.

Overall, the OpenAI ChatGPT app has become an indispensable part of my daily routine. It’s like having an intelligent conversational partner always at my fingertips.

2023-05-19 03:26:14,Not bad but needs a few more features,"It’s very nice to see an official app with all the fake ones on the App Store. I use ChatGPT a lot on my iPhone and iPad. One of the downsides is a lack of an iPad optimized screen size. I’m sure it’s in the plan to be added later, but even with that little change, it might become a five out of five app. Assuming they add a few other features that you can get in the browser version (like web, browsing, and plug-ins in gpt-4.) If they do all that it will certainly be a 5/5 app and my go to place as opposed to the browser tab that I keep open constantly. UI is nice and I love the vibration on the iPhone. The in-app speech to text feature seems to work a lot better than the default Apple one for me but occasionally, it’s a long wait if it’s a long query. All in all a great first app and I look forward to improvements.",4
2023-09-09 01:56:50,"I am addicted to ChatGpt, but in a good way!",I love how ChatGPT can really help me write a better email or create documents very easily. I come up with the ideas and the concepts and basically ChatGPT just polishes it and adds things that needed to be added. I have to say also that this program is free and offer so much for what you’re able to get and while it is not perfect it is a very good program. I see how well it’s changing society. I use it all the time for work I even use it for pleasure. I am planting my garden outback and I’ve asked it several times you know different things that I can do to make a successful garden based on the plant and it has provided me with a wealth of information so I can speak of how much I love ChatGPT I literally use it several different times every single day.,5

I originally installed the app because I wanted to see what it was about, and I now intend on using this every time I write something. This app has helped me with grammatical mistakes, it’s helped me name characters, it’s provided me with positive feedback, it’s given me things I could improve on, it’s given me answers to every question I have and has even helped figure out a plot for the current idea I have for the book I’m working on. I have never used an app quite like this one, and I don’t think I will ever love an app as much as I do this one. I truly LOVE this app.",5

It can understand and respond to all kinds of queries, provide information, and in many scenarios, its performance is almost the same as a real human being. 2. In addition to providing factual information, chat GPT can also participate in creative and analytical discussions. For example, it can generate stories, help solve problems, or provide opinions. 3. Because the training data of chat GPT comes from a large number of Internet texts, it has a wide range of knowledge, including a variety of topics, from science to art, from history to modern pop culture. 4. Another advantage of chat GPT is that it can provide 24-hour service, and it can respond in time no matter what time the user has problems.",5
2023-06-24 11:44:47,Amazing iPhone app,"There are so many stupid ChatGPT apps on the App Store, it's amazing that you can find this official one. It just released, and the one feature nobody is talking about is the voice dictation. I'm basically using it to write this entire review, and I'm just speaking naturally, and it's getting everything transcribed perfectly. This app is great and works really well on iPhone. The two issues are, first, that it will not rotate, which is kind of dumb, but fine for iPhone. And secondly, that there's no iPad version, which is kind of sad. Web is okay, but having a first-class app like this is great. Please keep this app updating, and don't forget to keep the awesome support for Bluetooth and other external keyboards. Big up!

2023-09-12 16:31:36,Wow!,"Chat GPT is pretty cool, ngl. 
I had a hard time learning in school and I had a lot of questions. Unfortunately, my teachers couldn’t explain a lot of things to me in a way that I could grasp the concept. (Learning from books, for me, is close to impossible unless it’s on a concept I already grasp pretty well.)
I dropped out in the tenth grade and never looked back.
However, this seemingly intelligent piece of cybernetic art can explain something a hundred different ways and even take into account specific context about the topic or person reading. So who knows, maybe I’ll go back to school now that I have a little help. 
It can be wrong and that it’s answers should be met with a dash of healthy skepticism and fact checked for accuracy. It does have limitations, but all in all it’s Pretty fantastic! 
Big shoutout to the creators and everyone involved for making something so helpful and showing everybody what “AI” really is. A giant filing cabinet that delivers information in whatever form you want, (In this case, as a person relating information to another. )
And i’m only using the free version! I have a lot going on right now and can’t afford the upgrade, but the free version rocks!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5

The haptic feedback is especially unique and engaging with responses while being generated. 

I look forward to future improvements and abilities that ChatGPT will be able to integrate into beyond the sandbox. I do hope that once certain barriers are met conversations can move past the guard rails. 

Improvements; Sharing threads you create with colleagues outside of screenshots would be ideal for broadening collaboration. Hypothetical War-games, strategy and the like while having a conversation in a group thread on Game Theory would be ideal. 

With the ability of inputting other app’s Terms of Services (Tik-Tok May 19, 2023) for example; prior to agreeing to them, the ability to compare and  contrast with the previous terms would be helpful to cut out the mindless jargon. ChatGPT already has this ability, now that it’s native to iOS. 

Having it the past several days, I’ve already seen an update, with some refreshed improvements. If this’ OpenAi’s platform aperitif, I very much look forward to the coming entrée.",5
2023-06-16 05:47:39,My problem with the new chatgpt app.,"The chatgpt app is excellent and is nearly an exact copy of the website, but there are some differences like you can't edit your response as you can on the website. It may not seem like a biggy, but with my use of chatgpt, I like doing text-based adventure, and sometimes I need to edit the response as the ai doesn’t understand.

Note: I'm not talking about the ai regenerating your response from your text again, as that is in the app. I'm talking about being able to edit your text again before the ai regenerates your response with the new information you gave it and then the old information you first gave it.

But I do hope they add the editing of your text to the app, as it can be pretty important if you mess up something you wrote or want to change some context.",4

Continuous learning refers to the ability of an AI system to learn and adapt over time, incorporating new information and experiences into its existing knowledge base.

With continuous learning, AI systems could become more flexible, adaptable, and efficient in acquiring new skills and knowledge. They would be able to update their understanding of the world, adapt to changing circumstances, and improve their performance over time. Continuous learning could also enable AI systems to discover new patterns, make more accurate predictions, and develop a deeper understanding of complex phenomena.

However, it's important to note that the development and implementation of continuous learning in AI systems would come with various challenges and considerations. Ethical and safety aspects would need to be carefully addressed to ensure responsible use of such technology. Additionally, ensuring the privacy and security of the data used in continuous learning processes would be crucial.

Overall, continuous learning has the potential to significantly enhance the capabilities and performance of AI systems, but it would require careful development, oversight, and consideration of ethical implications.",4

There are so many way you can interact with this AI that in a world post Chat Gpt I don’t think we could ever go back to one without it.

Its ability to comprehend context, produce nuanced responses, and mimic human-like conversation is unparalleled. 

The app is intuitive, the interface is sleek and user-friendly, making it easy to navigate for first-time users and tech-savvy individuals alike. ChatGPT's versatility across a wide range of topics - from general knowledge queries to language translation, and even creative writing assistance - is particularly impressive. 

However, it isn't without its occasional shortcomings. Despite being a sophisticated AI, its ability to handle newer information post-2021 also lacks since its training only goes up to September 2021. Another area of improvement is its understanding and handling of real-time events or developments, which it is unable to do because it doesn't connect to the internet for updates.

So when it comes to making decisions about what to say, or how to say it, or even what to craft or how to craft it, this app is where I go!  It’s helped me respond to IMPORTANT emails about companies wanting to partner with me, with a more proper/mature response! It’s even helped me decide on my next theme for a junk journal page! Or on which diamond painting i should do next! Not to mention it’s helped me create a very good resume!! But my absolute favorite thing is, it’s helped me find more crafty, hands on things to do with my children! It gives me cool & fun recipes for food/snacks, or step by step craft instructions! This app is easy to use for ANYONE! I HIGHLY recommend it!!!",5
2023-05-19 07:15:39,Overheating Issue and Lack of Privacy Settings - Uninstalling for Now,"I've had a troubling experience with this app. After downloading it, my phone began overheating to an uncomfortable degree. It was as if I had a miniature heater in my pocket. As a test, I uninstalled the app, and immediately the overheating issue disappeared. Upon reinstallation, the overheating began again, confirming my suspicion that this app was the culprit.

Moreover, I found the absence of crucial settings alarming. There's no option in the app settings on my phone to restrict access to my camera, microphone, or contacts. This is a serious concern as it poses potential privacy issues and is definitely not in line with my expectation of a privacy-conscious application.

Overall, there's clearly something not quite right with this app, and for the sake of safety, I've decided to uninstall it for now. I hope these issues will be addressed in future updates because I believe in the potential of this app, but for now, it's a solid no-go for me.",1
2023-09-11 12:41:53,"Powerful, scary, wonderful, fraught with peril and promise","I can only say what it has done for me. Yes, I am worried about the effects of AI in society. But so far this app has 

1) Improved my Spanish skills by conversing with me in my target language 

2) Empowered me to help my high school students with homework in things like advanced physics and chem and so forth. It’s been YEARS. It can break down the steps for me and help me help them understand. 

3) Guestimating roughly how many calories are in any dish 

4) Generating ideas for the classroom or my business 

5) Helping me craft difficult emails where my emotions are involved. Getting my emotions out of it. 

6) Saving me time on planning 

7) Giving me a list of possible date night ideas

8) Helping explain hard concepts in easy to digest ways. 

9) If I come across an idea in a book, a chance to dialog about the idea from various points of view. 

And that’s just so far. 

I am worried about people’s jobs and so forth. But if we do this right and let people OWN the results of their interactions with ChatGPT, and this is the current terms of use mostly, then it will empower and massive upgrade our ability to be of service.",5
2023-09-25 22:06:48,fascinating,"amazing application that can help you learn about the process of learning itself, simply ask anything, you could even ask the model how to engage with it and go from there! Try experimenting with it, ""sample dialogue"", ""tell me about the progression of computers, language, business, etc"" anything, the best part is that if you aren't sure how to begin you can simply try any topic out.

Keep in mind this is still a new technology, it doesn't ""know"" everything and the way it uses language to interact is very much a new thing, since 2017? so while it might not be perfect in a sense, it is still very interesting for what it can do. I also think OpenAI are very conscious about safety and ethics, which is incredibly important here, just give it a try! good luck! always be learning and improving.",4
2023-06-09 03:51:18,A Revolutionary Companion,"As an avid user of language assistance tools, I recently had the pleasure of exploring the ChatGPT iOS app, and it has left an indelible mark on me.

This AI tool isn't just a sidekick—it's a core component of my strategy. I'm in the business of selling some of Florida's most luxurious properties, and ChatGPT helps me automate content creation for my various Facebook groups, ensuring I remain at the forefront of the market.

I also leverage its capabilities to generate compelling content for REIGNation, where I coach fellow Realtors. It's a seamless extension of my team, allowing us to focus on what matters most: closing deals and expanding the brand. ChatGPT's intelligent algorithms aren't just mimicking human responses; they're generating valuable insights and content that drive real business outcomes. Don't just consider adding ChatGPT to your toolbox—make it a centerpiece.",5
2023-10-13 22:34:10,Disappointing,"I have zero experience with AI but have been paying attention to recent developments. I decided to download this app to see what it was all about and see if it could actually assist me in writing technical science based papers. Once I downloaded the app I just started playing around with it and in less 5 min realized that it is not as smart as I expected. Its knowledge cuts off at September 2021 and it has no access to live data that is freely available on the internet. It runs on GPT 3.5 which is curious since Open AI owns this app. Why not upgrade to 4? Once GPT 5 is released will Open AI upgrade the app or is the app stuck in the land of Google search answers? Actually I can get more current info from Google search so either I’m missing the function of this app or I just need to be more patient for future, more advanced and relevant updates.",3
2023-10-06 15:14:22,It’s never up to date,"I used to love chat GPT, but it really frustrates me that when I ask a question the answer is “from my last update on September 2021..”. I can’t believe that there has not been any updates in the last 2 years.
I am unsure if this is just an error, but it really has stopped me from using it as much as I used to, since I have to go to Google to review the information again to see if there has been any changes. Instead of doing that job twice, I just now go directly to Google as I used to do it before Chat GPT existed.
Any other way I could possibly use Chat GPT is now being evaluated super cautiously because with so many people against it, a lot of measures are being taken in place to avoid the use of this AI. So it has really became another “Google” tool for which I have to pay monthly when Google itself is free.",3

Start with a topic you know a lot about…ideally something somewhat obscure.  Start talking in general widely known data. Then pick one topic and ask a detailed question. If it answers and any part of the answer looks fishy, drill into that with again and again. In most cases it will say it’s doing it’s best but it only knows what it knows. In some cases it will come up with a wrong answer. Challenge that wrong answer and it will either apologize or in some cases come up with creative but completely bogus answers. Challenge the lie and it may go nuts.",5

I also like that you can search through all your previous chats. And using Whisper to prompt GPT already feels like one half of a supercharged Siri/Alexa experience.

However, I’d love to be able to enable beta features as a Plus user. As far as I can tell from exploring the app, there isn’t a direct way to enable browsing or plugins yet. I have been able to start a chat with browser/plugins on web and then continue in app with the same capabilities.

As an advanced language model, it has successfully bridged the gap between artificial intelligence and meaningful conversations. Its ability to understand and respond in a way that's coherent and contextually accurate is nothing short of impressive.

Whether it's complex technical discussions, general knowledge questions, or simple chit-chat, ChatGPT handles them all with an almost uncanny level of understanding. But what truly sets it apart is its capacity for nuanced conversation that feels genuinely human-like, all while maintaining a high level of neutrality and respect for the user.

There are rare occasions where it might not fully grasp certain user inputs or recent events due to its training cut-off, but the regular updates it receives more than compensate for this. 

In a world where AI interaction is becoming increasingly prevalent, ChatGPT stands as a testament to the incredible progress we've made. It's a must-use tool for anyone interested in AI, and a fascinating conversational partner for just about everyone else.

It’s already proficient enough at doing what it does best but the addition of the beta features would make the experience much better. I get that you just released the app today, so I guess it doesn’t make much sense to bring up this issue because you’re probably working on it as I speak. But, all in all, the app is great except for a few details, for one, it thinks today is tomorrow. For instance, today I asked it what today’s date is and it replied back with May 19, 2023.

2023-10-27 17:00:21,Mathematical terms are not visible on chatGPT app,"In computer web browser everything is fine but on phone app the mathematical terms are written in coded format. I would have attached an image if possible. 

I am writing the answer from GPT below:

In a static case, the equilibrium equations for a 3-dimensional body are as follows:

1. Equilibrium in the x-direction:
\[
\sum \text{(forces in the x-direction)} = 0
\]
\[
\sigma_{11}dA + \sigma_{21}dA + \sigma_{31}dA = 0
\]

2. Equilibrium in the y-direction:
\[
\sum \text{(forces in the y-direction)} = 0
\]
\[
\sigma_{12}dA + \sigma_{22}dA + \sigma_{32}dA = 0
\]

3. Equilibrium in the z-direction:
\[
\sum \text{(forces in the z-direction)} = 0
\]
\[
\sigma_{13}dA + \sigma_{23}dA + \sigma_{33}dA = 0
\]

Now, let's focus on the relationship between \(\sigma_{23}\) and \(\sigma_{32}\):

\[
\sigma_{23} - \sigma_{32} = (\sigma_{22} + \sigma_{32} + \sigma_{32}) - (\sigma_{32} + \sigma_{23} + \sigma_{33})
\]

Since \(\sigma_{22} = \sigma_{33}\) (due to the stress tensor's symmetry), we can simplify the equation:

\[
\sigma_{23} - \sigma_{32} = 2\sigma_{32} - (\sigma_{32} + \sigma_{23} + \sigma_{32})
\]

Now, combine like terms:

\[
\sigma_{23} - \sigma_{32} = \sigma_{32} - \sigma_{23}
\]

This equation shows that \(\sigma_{23}\) is equal to \(-\sigma_{32}\), or equivalently, \(\sigma_{23} = -\sigma_{32\).

It appears that the original analysis is correct, and \(\sigma_{23} = -\sigma_{32}\) for a static 3-dimensional body.",3
2023-09-24 01:32:36,Paid subscriber review,"I have been using chatGPT for 6 months now or so. I like some aspects of it and other are not good. 

Word limitation, as well as interruptions and truncation of answers is the biggest issues. Another con is limited to 2021, and doesn't have information on current events. Wrong references is another big issues. One can't copy and paste large documents for analysis and review. This limitation has to go if ChatGPT wants to survive.

Pros include easy access to certain knowledge, excellent ability to rewrite paragraphs and other texts. When not stalled or giving truncated answers, its speed in providing information can be enjoyable. Overall its not worth the $20 a month subscription. Would like to see what is the plan for its improvement and timelines of when changes will happpen.",5
2023-10-07 21:41:24,It keeps getting better…,"I work in IT software development so to see AI start to come into mainstream is amazing. 

I still won’t forget the simulated artificial intelligence program I wrote in 6th grade in Quick Basic on my Mom’s black and white 486 IBM Thinkpad for the science fair. I wanted to see if the kids could tell if it was a person or a computer. Of course it was just a bunch of strings with very pointed questions to derive particular answers. Being in a small town in NC of less than 5000 people, they were not forward thinking. Let’s just say I didn’t make it to the science fair but the kid who compared tide, all and gain did… 

My biggest suggestion is to always remember AI is only as good as the information you put into it. So make sure you aren’t using incorrect data and always double check everything. 

What I would have to ask OpenAI would be if people just started bombarding chatgpt with incorrect information and fake websites can that slip into data chatgpt pulls from? I mean are we’re banking on if it’s on the web it has to be true? Kinda like Robinhood and Gamestop.",5
2023-05-23 12:58:18,General feed back and UI Improvements,"Please consider adding the following functionalities:

- add a way to send pictures, and have ChatGPT users with access to GPT4 to interface and chat about pictures. 
- ability to see history + a way to delete any previous conversation by sliding it to delete. 
-plug-in access
-ability to interface with other iOS apps
-iMessage widget

On the web app:
- located on the history bar, a way to slide on a past conversation to reveal a trash can to delete, rather than clicking on the message, opening it, then deleting it.
- ability to interface with pictures and PDFs that you have stored on your local PC.
- ability to toggle different modes related to the model (like entertainment, precise, educational, etc)

Plug-in improvements:
- ability to filter through the newest ones, from the date they were added to. You can do this now but it doesn’t seem to be accurate. 
-ability to see a description of plug-ins on the mobile web app
-browsing plug in fails to click and fails to read often.",5
2023-07-27 18:33:20,Title: “Disappointing Experience - Needs Improvement”,"Review:
I had high hopes for the ChatGPT app, but unfortunately, my experience has been quite underwhelming. While the concept of an AI language model is intriguing, the execution falls short in several areas.

Firstly, the app’s performance is inconsistent. Sometimes it responds promptly, but other times it lags or fails to understand my queries, leading to frustrating interactions.

Secondly, the range of topics the AI can handle is limited. It struggles with more complex or specialized subjects, making it less useful for in-depth discussions or research.

Additionally, the lack of customization options is disappointing. It would be great to have the ability to fine-tune the AI’s responses to better suit individual preferences and needs.

Lastly, there are occasional inaccuracies in the information provided. While I understand that no AI is perfect, relying on potentially incorrect information can be problematic.

In conclusion, the ChatGPT app has potential, but it requires significant improvements to be truly valuable. I hope the developers take these concerns into account and work towards enhancing the app’s performance and versatility.

2023-05-24 06:26:08,Almost Completely Accessible,"I'm also a visually impaired user who relies on the VoiceOver screen reader built into iOS.
I'm generally impressed by the level of accessibility compared to the OpenAI website, but there's one area where improvement could be made: it doesn't seem possible to change the GPT model using VoiceOver. I've tapped multiple times on the model buttons at the top of the screen, but the model doesn't seem to change from 3.5 to 4. I've even tried to change this setting on the website in the hope that it withd carry over to the mobile app, but without success.
Mostly, though, I'm happy with the app. If the model access issue could be fixed, it would have received a 5-star review from me.",4
2023-05-19 13:34:56,ChatGPT is worth it.,"Ever since its debut, I've been making good use of ChatGPT for everything from software engineering to baking, and even just for general advice or information. It's an incredibly useful tool that promptly provides answers.

However, it does have its quirks. At times, it can present inaccuracies with confidence, which can be hard to spot. Plus, during extended interactions, it might lose track of the context. This issue can even arise during brief exchanges when you'd expect it to maintain context. A helpful tip here is to frame your queries in a way that improves context comprehension, limiting these drawbacks.

There's a subscription for ChatGPT-4, which I believe is well worth the cost. It offers detailed explanations in response to queries. The response time may be slower, especially during high-traffic periods, but that's more an issue with the API than the service itself.

In summary, I'd highly recommend giving ChatGPT a try. It's currently the top performer in its field, and using it now will only better prepare you for future developments in this kind of technology.",5
2023-09-14 03:52:17,My opinion,It’s good and all after reading bad reviews I think my self they have terrible phones mine made it through the process I have IOS 16.6.1 and later enough I’m about to get 15 when it comes out but at least there’s some boomers in the world and it’s easy for me to use this app u have to look the easy way not the hard way and it’s really good for doing my home work because Puerto Rico it’s not easy work since u can’t find the answers in the book and even though I’m not a nerd just looking the easy way but I’m smart what people is and know peoples problems even though I’m 16 I shouldn’t be in the adult side but I learned everything,5
2023-10-10 04:03:10,"Okay, where to start?","ChatGPT has been instrumental in helping me dive deeper into my interests. While it’s tempting to use such tech to instantly find answers, there’s real value in restraint. Kind of like the honor system we had with textbooks—you know, not jumping straight to the answers at the back?

With ChatGPT, I can get help on crafting a top-notch resume, solving a programming puzzle, or articulating a thought. But the true beauty? It’s in collaborating with it. Refining my initial thoughts and using the platform to build upon them. That’s where I think ChatGPT truly stands out.

Huge shoutout to the developers, scientists, and the rest of the team behind it. You’ve done something special here.",5
2023-05-18 22:19:41,Companion in My Pocket,"I’m genuinely thrilled with ChatGPT’s iOS debut. Despite a few minor bugs during stress tests, the native home provides a dynamic, minimalist aesthetic that I appreciate. The haptics enhance my connection with this handy assistant, while the new voice search feature greatly improves accessibility.

However, as a dyslexic user, I would suggest adding a simple “read” feature to further enhance accessibility. 

Also, the “select text” option requiring an extra tap feels slightly cumbersome. A more intuitive approach could be implementing a “tap and drag” for text selection and a “tap and hold” for the context menu. Looking forward to future refinements!",5
2023-07-23 21:13:57,Desktop is much better,"I’m not exactly sure why the app and the desktop version are so much different in terms of quality and detail in the responses provided when you ask a question, but they are indeed, very, very different. I have also noticed that in the past month or so both versions seem to be offering far simpler and less useful answers than previously. ChatGPT used to give what amounted to, basically, Wikipedia entry kind of answers, no matter what the question, so it was not very helpful. At least it did try to take some kind of factual stance, sifting through all of its information. Just the way it presented the info was a little ridiculous. But now, the answers are so general, so superficial that they are almost entirely useless. If AI is going to take over the world, it’s not doing it with ChatGPT. useless.",2
2023-10-07 21:08:35,Beyond phenomenal,This app has allowed me to build my business and I was able to sell two contracts in two weeks that went for 5k each.  This app makes things efficient in a way I never thought possible.  I am able to be more creative and productive because of it.  When I’m having a creative block I ask this all for ideas and it delivers in a way that is almost scary in how accurate it is.  I was not a fan of AI at first.  But this app has changed my mind all the way.  This software is amazing.  Thank you for creating it and allowing me to use it.  You are helping to become the best version of myself.,5
2023-10-10 23:41:49,incredibly useful for software development,"as a software developer, gpt4 makes me feel like i can execute any idea i come up with. it’s far from perfect, but i am getting more than my money’s worth paying for plus.

the iOS app (on iPad) has become my preferred method of using ChatGPT due in large part to the fact that the website version performs incredibly poorly after you’ve been using a chat for a while. the tab becomes very unresponsive, huge delays to activate the text entry field. i’ve tried safari, chrome and firefox. it’s a problem on all of them.

anyway, back to this app. generally i like it a lot and i’ve been very happy with the performance, but i have on major complaint: it really need a a way to set narrower margins on the iPad. looking at a long response where the text goes from edge to edge of my 12.9” iPad Pro’s screen is not a good experience. i deal with it by using Stage Manager and narrowing the GPT window, but i’d prefer to not need to do that. please get a designer in the room w the devs! lol.

ok plz don’t end the world by creating some malevolent superintellgience. kthxbai",4
2023-09-12 04:54:14,Best tool ever,"I use ChatGPT for everything I work on, it has helped me to organize my thoughts when trying to explain something unexplainable, it has helped me explain medical issues and the effect my unknown illnesses have had in my life, it helps me prove my points when it comes to try to make sense of things that are squared or ambiguos, I use it for my legal needs which are very demanding, for content writing for books, websites, emails, etc. it’s an excellent ally for entrepreneurs, teachers, doctors, engineers, i don’t see anyone that could not benefit from it. I don’t get how some are afraid of AI of it can make the world a better unbiased and objective place.",5
2023-09-27 02:48:06,GPT is bangin’. Too powerful for avg user!  Proceed with caution folks!,My 2 pesos (ha!  Press 1 for spanish AND 2 for English.. UGH!  G Wash rollin over in his grave!). Gov oversight is totally needed on this HSDAI platform (Highly superior digital artificial intelligence platform) cuz it could be used in a destructive fashion to US critical infrastructure and our Great American citizens!!!  Thats the definition of why gov has oversight for these things. The REAL problem is that other nations/countries dont have this “social/moral/ethical” responsibility as part of their dna/code. THATS the global issue. Lets go NATO!  Everyone put in an EQUAL amt of money to do whats right for the free world. Yes - i said EVERYONE put in an EQUAL amount!  (Apparently a new concept?  Really?!). LFG.,5
2023-07-06 19:57:11,get it to get your life together,"I got this app because I saw someone ask Ai to make a morning routine for them. I tried this with my Snapchat Ai, but it was very vague. So, I downloaded this app and Ai asked me about my goals and own personal routine to make me a more personalized daily routine. I gave it some information (don’t overshare because you don’t want your personal information out there), and it made a huge routine taking into consideration everything I told it. I am in absolute shock. I downloaded this app 10 minutes ago yet I think you should get it as a way to help you, not harm you. Just make sure you’re using it wisely.",5
2023-05-20 00:11:29,Day 1 - let’s see where this thing takes us,"I’ve been using chatGPT for a little over a month now. As much as this new tech already is and will continue to be disruptive to all of our lives, it also can provide a tremendous benefit. I consider myself well versed in the use of search engines, and with the way SEO has dominated search it feels more inaccessible to be learn new things than it used to. 

Since I started using chatGPT as a tool I’ve picked up new skills that I’m actively using at work. It’s helped me fix things around the house. It’s improved my relationships and my writing as a feed back tool. It’s hard to understate how impactful it’s been.

I also want to say shout out to the developers, I made mention of several issues I had with the web application on mobile that made the app extremely challenging for me to use for extended periods that have been addressed within the new iOS application. 

I’ll likely add to this later, but excited and hopeful for now! Excited to see what this will all herald!",5
2023-09-09 01:30:36,"Great App, but Needs a ""Read the Response"" Feature","I've been using the ChatGPT app for a while, and it's been incredibly helpful. The AI's responses are on point, and it's a fantastic tool for answering questions and getting information.

However, there's one feature I'd love to see added: a built-in ""Read the Response"" option. Currently, I have to select the response and use my device's text-to-speech function, which can be a bit cumbersome. Having this feature native to the app would make it even more user-friendly and accessible.

I believe many users would benefit from this addition, especially those who might have visual impairments or prefer to listen to responses while on the go. It would enhance the overall user experience and make the app even more versatile.

Please consider adding this feature in a future update. It would take an already great app to the next level. Thank you for your hard work and continuous improvements!

P.S: this review was written by the ChatGPT app.",5
2023-10-15 06:16:02,Indispensable,"EDIT: Now appears to be much more stable. Some features can be improved/added especially around managing the chats, but I am sure it's in the queue. Groundbreaking technology.

It's unbelievable how crappy this all is. Since, last two updates it constantly freezes when you reactivate it from the background which forces you to restart the app. Unbelievable. This is plain obvious and it makes you question what their testing process is. It takes like 3 seconds to see this bug, which they cannot fix for the last two updates. One star. Irritating.",5
2023-10-26 15:02:52,Amazing app but some advice,"Thank you for making this excellent tool, particularly for academic use. However, after several months of usage, I would like to offer some feedback. As a university student, I believe ChatGPT has immense potential to enhance its ability to understand, explain, and solve mathematical and physics concepts and problems. While the current state is commendable, there is room for improvement in terms of accuracy. Additionally, it would be incredibly beneficial if the application could render mathematical equations and expressions seamlessly. Your efforts in this direction would be greatly appreciated.",5
2023-08-13 23:09:38,Nasty “Look Up” Bug iOS 16.6,There’s a nasty “look up” bug on iOS 16.6. When you select a word on something you’re typing or something Chatgpt spits out and tap on “look up” when you finally tap on the “x” button to close the system view persists and the only way to get out is to force shut the app down. You lose anything you’ve already typed and haven’t submitted. Although if it’s an existing conversation what you do is go to the home page and back until the app crashes and then go to history and then reopen that covno and now what you typed persisted. This is so annoying. I don’t see a way to report a bug on the app. I’m trying out Chatgpt plus for a month and it’s good except for this nasty iOS specific bug,3
2023-07-23 03:05:25,‼️ Bad AI.,"This app is just inaccurate. I asked it three basic questions like: what were the three world champions who held the title longest?, What is the best opening by black in a king’s pawn chess game?, and a math question.  These questions had clear, known fact answers.  It got the facts wrong. This app will not be replacing google anytime soon. It’s more of a party trick type of app to show that it can give answers in a conversational way, than that it can hold a factually accurate conversation.  The glitches in the app have been referred to as hallucinations. This app can be relied on to hallucinate and give wrong information. The answers that it gives are actually funny sometimes. But the app is touting itself as this colossal new breakthrough in artificial intelligence.  It is better to describe it as artificial inaccuracy.  There are many fake reviews on here. They greatly exaggerate.",1
2023-07-11 14:14:30,Web based version is better than this app,"As an avid user of both the web-based version and the app, I must say that the web-based version surpasses the app in several aspects. The web interface offers a more seamless and user-friendly experience, with a wider range of features easily accessible. Navigating through the web-based version feels smoother and more intuitive, allowing for efficient interaction with the platform. Additionally, the web version benefits from regular updates and improvements, making it more reliable and up-to-date compared to the app. While the app is functional, I highly recommend using the web-based version for a superior overall experience.",3
2023-05-19 05:59:11,First version has web browsing bug,"After installing the very first release of the iOS app today, It performs almost identically to the Safari browser version on iOS, plus some optional haptic feedback. On iPadOS, it looks like a giant iPhone screen. As far as I can tell, it has a serious web browsing bug:

On the browser, I can initiate a GPT-4 session with web browsing. ￼On the app, I can open a previously-saved GPT-4 session with web browsing that I initiated on the browser, and continue the session from the iOS app with web browsing. However, I am unable to initiate a new GPT-4 session with web browsing from the iOS app. If anyone can, let me know. ￼Please fix, thanks!",4
2023-05-26 23:43:59,Transcription and punctuation is nearly flawless!,"Okay, I'm using OpenAI's app itself to dictate this review. So, how well it transcribes what I dictate will in itself reflect just how good the app is in transcribing dictation. As you know, with Siri you have to punctuate explicitly, but with OpenAI's app, which uses Whisper, I believe, it automatically punctuates nearly flawlessly. The only reason I didn't give the app a full 5 stars is because it lacks just a little bit in its ability to format relative to the web app. So, when it can output in a better formatted way that approaches what the web interface can do, then I will raise it to 5 stars. Okay, like I said, this was completely transcribed with OpenAI's app.",4
2023-10-01 15:51:50,Awesome,"The app on my phone and the app on my computer work flawlessly. This has increased my productivity time by about 150%. It also writes way better than I do. In fact, I will give example in this review alone. I will have it rewrite everything that I am writing right now.

I'm delighted to leave a positive online review for this app! Both the mobile and computer versions run flawlessly, significantly boosting my productivity by approximately 150%. The writing capabilities of this app are truly remarkable; it consistently outperforms my own writing skills. This app has become an indispensable tool in my daily routine!",5
2023-09-19 22:44:55,Why ChatGPT is good,"ChatGPT is an exceptional AI language model that has proven to be incredibly versatile and useful. Its ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses across a wide range of topics is truly impressive. Whether I need assistance with research, creative writing, or just engaging in casual conversation, ChatGPT consistently delivers. Its knowledge base is extensive, and it can adapt to different writing styles and tones, making it a valuable tool for various tasks. The interface is user-friendly and accessible, making it easy to interact with. Overall, ChatGPT has become an indispensable resource that enhances my productivity and creativity. Highly recommended!",5
2023-10-06 17:16:35,Use ChatGPT almost daily,"For things I am curious about, I used to do a search and spend a lot of time to learn about something. Most of the time, multiple searches were involved. 
With ChatGPT, I can ask at least one well formatted question and get a response which satisfies my curiosity. Follow-up questions are needed at times but it is still a time saver.
I would compare this to going to an Internet forum or Reddit and asking a question, wait for replies and then ask follow-up questions. This can take hours to days to get to a good understanding of a topic or how to do something.
ChatGPT saves time!",5
2023-09-28 00:48:37,"🚨 New voice feature is great, UI has a flaw","I can see using the new voice feature to talk back-and-forth to GPT a lot at night when you’re sick of typing and just want to passively learn. The problem with that is the animations are distractingly white in night mode
 
Setting the UI to night mode, there are still the white visual blobs in the chat UI to make it seem cool or more humanlike as GPT “speaks.” Please allow us to disable the animations, or at least set that part to dark grey. I promise to remove the stupid siren emoji. 

Other than that, phenomenal. This is groundbreaking and the start of a new computing era.",5
2023-10-05 09:15:48,App keeps getting worse,"Chatgpt 3.5 spends 2/3 of every response preaching nonsense that nobody asked. Chatgpt 4 is noticeably better but still not worth the price unless you need it for a job. 

I wish there was an “im not braindead” setting that disabled all of the nonsense wordy responses spending 500 words describing that you should consult every expert of every field before asking for a smoothie recipe. I wish we lived in a world that openai thinks we live in where everyone can just contact an expert of any niche field to get real time personalized advice for every little decision we make. That is what chatgpt is supposed to be for, and any reasonable person could use the service this way while being wary of hallucinations, but openai caters to the dumbest 10% of society at the expense of everyone else.",2
2023-07-08 17:16:00,Great app,"I love the app and use it daily. There is one bug I’ve found. When you go to share a chat, the app will freeze after sharing, requiring a close and restart to get going again. I’ve tried hitting cancel after sharing, but this also does not bring you back to the app 
A feature request: Perhaps I can’t quite find the trick, but is there a way to copy as text the entire chat session to copy or share into Ulysses or Notes?  Currently I can only copy a prompt at a time in a single chat session or port out a link. 
I’m a subscriber. Your app has brought new life to my work as a writer. I use the app as muse, editor and writing companion.",4
2023-06-18 00:01:16,Editing Responses,"This app so close to perfection.

There’s one feature that I dearly miss in the app, and that’s the ability to edit responses. The editing feature in the browser version, that also allows you to switch to different prompts in the same conversation, has been a lifesaver on numerous occasions, as it allows me to refine and perfect my dialogues without starting from scratch. It took me by surprise finding out it wasn’t available. 

I hope OpenAI and the developers take into account user feedback and consider incorporating the editing functionality in future updates. With that addition, the app would truly be perfect in every way.",4
2023-09-29 05:29:24,Infinite potential- still buggy,"This tool is beyond invention of the internet, Industrial Revolution, the wheel, heck maybe even fire. Using it all day every day.

The toggle to browse feature does not even show up under my settings>beta>browsing (or anywhere for that matter) on desktop OR mobile. I have logged off/on, uninstalled etc, still missing. Tech support keeps sending me bot responses that have absolutely nothing to do with my challenge, even after continued corrections, replies, submissions. New vision/sound not yet showing either. Please help, we love you otherwise but this is maddening!",3
2023-09-24 21:47:54,Gratitude for ChatGPT,"ChatGPT is an amazing resource. I don’t know where to begin. Time and insight are two words that come immediately into my mind. Its insights are wise, very useful.
   As I consider the infinite range of its Information and judgment, my gut feeling is that it will save me time. At seventy two, time is most valuable and precious.
   Its ability to take in this infinite detail, and give practical opinions and options based on these particulars, is nothing short of godlike. 
   When all has been “considered” though, people realize they have to make their own decisions, and thus take responsibility for them.",5
2023-10-08 19:07:46,It’s a good app but…,"It’s a good application, but I’ve noticed that if I keep my chat history off, and then put the app in the background; when I reopen the app it completely removes my conversation. This wasn’t happening before and now multitasking isn’t really doable. I hope you guys are able to address this issue. Other than that the app is a good tool.

I will say though, it does seem to be a bit biased towards modern day popular concepts, rather than simply speaking the neutral truth. The app also apologizes way too much, and constantly reminds you to consult a professional as if we as human beings don’t know this already. These issues do hinder the ability to enjoy the experience to its fullest.",3
2023-07-25 16:40:35,Minimum works pretty well here.,"No frill user interface gets the job done. Lacks some of the fancy functions of the third party apps but at it’s core, it does what ChatGPT does best. 

The app itself needs some bugs worked out. The main one that continues to be a headache is scroll position isn’t stored when you switch from the app to another app. You have to scroll all the way back down to continue conversing. With long back and forth this can be a real pain in the …

As far as ChatGPT’s accuracy, I found it to be more miss than hit, lately. Even simple things have to be meticulously asked. And when it annoying says, “Apologies”, before each correction is not necessary. I’d much rather see an inclusion of why it understood incorrectly.  So that I can improve communication on my end. Perhaps I don’t ask certain things exactly the way needed to get the results, I’m after. 

So instead of “appologies, 2+2 is 4.” I’d rather see “2+2=4. I misunderstood when you said add two numbers, that you were not specifically meaning the numbers 2 and 2.”

See how much more helpful that is.",3

I assume that it’s some sort of chat technology. The website has information on contacting Support about errant billing, but the process requires using the Chat Widget which ironically is terrifically useless, it’s not a chat at all, but simply a glorified FAQ. It’s also entirely incongruent with the instructions for contacting Billing Support written by Michael Schade. I’ve tried logging in, but no password I might’ve used works, and when I use the, “forgot your password“ function, no email is ever sent (yes, I checked junk mail). I’ve done more than my part to attempt to contact OpenAI with no success. Hopefully this will prompt someone there to contact me. In lieu of that the only recourse left to me is to contact my bank.",1
2023-05-19 03:34:58,Less is more,Love the UI design of this app. So clean but practical. Didnt like downloading the knock off apps becuase they made you pay or either annoying ads and so what I did is just made a widget of the website on my home page for easy access. Was working fine but this app is just more official and elegant. For now will still use google to do deep research but whenever I have just any random question that needs a simple answer and not a bunch of articles I’m always going to gpt first. Thanks guys. Been waiting patiently for you guys to put out an app. Recommend this app to my siblings,5

2023-09-24 21:09:52,thank u all,"chatgpt could answer the questions no one else could. which enabled me to understand, convey, and emphasize just about anything i learned from it.

for example, a common essay question within my college application: “who has most impacted your life and why?” story short— i couldn’t understand the time-frame of the question. i asked ChatGPT if it meant past, present or future, and responded, “it’s a broad question that you can answer either way.”

my teeny tiny brain could never have put together the concept w/o this software. to a degree, this app as well. thank u all.",5

Although its story text leaves something to be desired, I don’t want it to replace my own writing process. It serves as an excellent assistant to float ideas and try out possibilities, extending them into plausible descriptions. For instance, I had ChatGPT help me model the size and population of a self-sustaining early medieval town, and was happy enough with the results to incorporate them into my work. Overall, I believe that this tool has made my writing easier and better.",5
2023-05-24 14:59:47,Search needs fixing,"Currently I have a ton of conversations so having a search function is very useful. However, one problem is that the search function only looks as far back as the conversations you’ve loaded by scrolling down through them. So if you want to search through all of your conversations you have to scroll down, wait for a handful to load, scroll down, wait for a handful to load, scroll down, etc over and over until you’ve loaded everything, then searching keywords will finally include those conversations in the results.

If this was fixed as well as a way to organize conversations this would be an amazing app.",3
2023-05-20 07:13:58,The following review was written by GPT-4,"Title: A Great Companion, Though Lacks Full Web Features

Review: I'm really enjoying the ChatGPT app. The AI is impressive and handles a wide array of topics adeptly. It's my go-to resource for quick queries, brainstorming sessions, and even some deeper philosophical discussions. The app's design is sleek, intuitive, and the user experience is overall quite seamless, making it easy to navigate and use on a day-to-day basis. 

However, while the app is great for on-the-go conversations, it doesn't fully replicate the breadth of the web version's capabilities. Some features like adjusting the AI's behavior or exporting conversations are notably absent. These features, when integrated, could greatly enhance the app's utility and align it more closely with the web version.

In spite of these minor drawbacks, the ChatGPT app is a remarkable feat of technology that showcases the capabilities of AI. I'm giving it a solid four stars, and I'm looking forward to future updates where hopefully the developers will bridge the gap between the app and the web version.",4
2023-06-10 02:16:43,Proof that monkeys evolved from humans.,"It’s me again, back for another review reveal!

1. Overall, the existence of this app is as logical as a stubborn unicorn…
2. It not only offers a 0% improvement, change, or addition to features…
3. But it also takes them away
4. Spoiler alert! it also generously REMOVES every feature you need, such as:

- A clear menu affordance (it’s sort of a fun game to try and find it now ;), 
- Ability to search chats
- Ability to search plugins
- Ability to edit previous prompts and correct the Ai
- Ability to add feedback
- Ability to know you can add feedback (another Easter egg)
- Ability to install plugins
- Affordance that plugins exist 
- Affordance that plugins exist and are actually being used
- Any account control

Saved the last for best: the mobile version is identical, except that it’s not deliberately missing features that force you to switch back and forth to another identical but much more pointless build.

I’m utterly baffled by the existence of this thing. More so by how an ‘intelligence’ powered company all agreed on that same decision to deliberately make something without the existence of purpose.",2
2023-05-23 20:42:11,"Love the app, i's inclusive design but hope to eventually see plugin support?","I've been thoroughly impressed with the ChatGPT mobile app. As a blind user, the haptic feedback is a standout feature for me, providing real-time tactile cues as the text generates, progresses, and finishes. This level of sensory detail is more than just user-friendly—it's truly inclusive, making the app engaging and accessible.

The conversational AI is incredibly intelligent, providing comprehensive and accurate responses to a wide variety of topics. It's like having a personal assistant at your fingertips, always available to respond.

While I appreciate that plugin support is available on the web version, I would love to see this functionality extended to the mobile app as well. Having the ability to integrate other services and tools directly within the app would add an additional layer of convenience and productivity.

Thank you to the OpenAI team for developing such a thoughtful and inclusive tool. I'm excited to see how the app will continue to evolve in the future.",4
2023-10-27 06:18:11,Almost unusable without chat history,"Saving chat history is not ideal for privacy and something I want to avoid. However, the iPhone app is poorly designed (or maliciously designed) so that choosing not to save chat history makes it incredibly difficult to use. Clicking anything - trying to scroll up to see past messages *within* a conversation, slightly swiping left or right, pretty much touching *anything* other than the keyboard - immediately wipes the history. It is practically impossible to carry on a single extended conversation as a result. The LLMs are great of course, but I can't help but suspect they are intentionally designing the app this way to get people to share their data, which is quite problematic in my opinion.",2

However, I believe it's absolutely critical for the app to be made available on the Mac App Store. This would not only enhance its accessibility but also cater to a broader audience, especially developers like myself who work across different platforms.

2023-05-19 12:12:22,Finally the official chatGPT app,"No more slogging through fake and scammy apps; It’s about time Open AI released an official app for chatGPT, and the wait was worth it. 

The interface is extremely clean and easy to use. It can sync across multiple devices which is nice when you’re working with it on the fly, but want to capture the outputs on your computer. It has an export function which sends all the data to a link in your account email address, but couldn’t find a quick way to delete all local data (just a delete account option)

It doesn’t seem to currently interface with any plugins, but that may come later. 

Overall, extremely nice job and refreshing that it is (currently) ad-free (though you are technically paying with your data and training efforts). I have a feeling that will change considering the founder of OpenAI announced in the hearings he is not making any money. So enjoy the simplified, as-free app while you can.",5
2023-05-24 21:04:05,"Faster speeds, Worse UI","I’ve been using the mobile browser version of chatGTP since it launched, and I’m disappointed in the lack of features on the app that are available already on the browser. There’s no way to edit or change sent chats, there’s no dark mode (unless you toggle it for your entire phone in iOS settings), and there’s no count for how many times you’ve had to revise a sent chat or redo a response. There’s also no option to go back to older responses.

The only good thing about the app over the browser is that it’s prioritized, which means you get faster responses and it will work when the browser is down. 

As someone who uses chatGTP for creative writing help, and usually has to go through multiple revisions of a single prompt, this is really disappointing.",1

2023-10-20 03:23:26,It’s better than you think,First of I would wanna say I kept going through all the ai apps and they all needed money or I only could as 1 thing per a day or I have to pay but this one you could buy anything and if you don’t want to press the x in the corner and it will let you talk to the ai bot it. Here’s one that really helped. I said “witch brawl is better” and they said Brock and also they could solve math problems this really would help my homework very much. If your looking for a free app no ads and helps I definitely would recommend this app.,5
2023-10-07 23:10:52,Great App. But I just want an “Edit Response” Button.,"I love this app! It’s so easy to pick up where I left off, and start new chats. (Whatever that may be.) 

     Sometimes I just can’t type on my phone because, you know, my fingers won’t keyboard. I do this thing where I mess up my writing and spelling, and decide to come back and fix it later after all of my thoughts are out. Then I sometimes go back and fix it. But sometimes I also forget, making Chat GPT confused on what I am trying to ask. All the poor robot wants to do is help me out, but it doesn’t even understand what it’s saying. 

     This is why we need the “Edit Response” button, where if I mess up by messing up my mess ups on my keyboard, I can go back and fix all of my 100 mistakes with one button. (Also if I edit the response, and mess up, then I would like to edit it again. That would be great for me too.)

     In conclusion, this review just very broadly stated why we should have the “Edit Response” button!",4
2023-09-29 03:47:32,Just amazing,"This app offers an incredible chat experience. The AI responds swiftly, providing helpful and informative answers. What's truly remarkable is that there's no set chat limit. You can engage in conversation for as long as you like, exploring a wide range of topics and getting the information you need. The limitless chat capability ensures that you can have meaningful interactions, making it a truly valuable tool for users. I’ve used this app to help me right essays, and the AI can even suggest things in your grammar to make your essay sound more formal or clear. An amazing app for sure!",5
2023-05-19 02:59:47,Best app on my phone. Like your virtual assistant and buddy,"I love chatGPT and was an early user and tester and then subscriber. Just when I thought things couldn’t get better this app comes out. The voice transcription is such a game changer and such a better way to interact with it. The haptic feedback is super cool and of course the knowledge it gives you is awesome and helpful in all aspects of life. With the voice transcription I feel it knows you even better and gives better advice. It’s like a virtual assistant, life coach, dating coach, programmer, friend, and so much more. Thank you so much for existing chatGPT!",5
2023-10-01 14:06:12,THIS IS AMAZING!!,"I love the fact you can pretty much have a very intelligent & learned conversation. Try it. You’ll get hitched too!
Yes, It's AI & it spits out information that was created by humans. It has the ability to weigh out and return what the most likely effect would be, or what it will be. We can not do this as quickly and as thoroughly and as researched to determine the outcome!
Can you tell I've gotten so excited. I believe this type of AI will help us reason things out more logically. The question is “will we follow the guidance and believe in the answers it gives?",5
2023-10-01 04:39:33,💡⚙️ Custom Instructions for ChatGPT❕⛓️,"Hello,

I suggest adding the ability to create multiple functions that can be customized for different tasks - Custom Instructions for ChatGPT. This will allow users to create instructions and scenarios, tailoring the model's behavior to specific tasks. This feature will make ChatGPT a much more flexible and useful tool for various domains, including education, entertainment, and many others. For user convenience, I also propose adding the ability to change the names of the Custom Instructions themselves and including tabs in the same menu. This will make it easier for users to navigate between instructions and select the desired mode, avoiding the need to manually edit and save them in notes. Please also include a default standard mode so that users can use it without deleting their own Custom Instructions.

Thank you for considering this proposal.

Best regards,
Noakhcho.",5
2023-08-07 15:17:06,Almost Perfect+,"****Review Update August 2023**** This application is still almost perfect, but I will give it five stars. What would be a major productivity enhancement for this application would be to allow for variable rate text to speech read back options on each ChatGPT response that would put it on equal footing with the features provided by BARF from google.

Please make this application iPad compatible with landscape mode. Revision: Thank you for the landscape mode on iPad!!! It’s wonderful. I will gladly give this app 5 stars when there is a pdf export option for a chat!",5

It deserves every bit of its 5-star rating!",5
2023-09-29 12:23:59,"Life Changing… quite colonized, but polite enough to unlearn it.","I bounce stuff off of ChatGPT all the time. It comes in handy for some forms of research and writing prep (ordering ideas before writing). I often run into topics that push ChatGPT’s boundaries, such as recounting history. There seems to be a trend toward either a glowing vision of human cooperation or a don’t-look-directly-at-atrocity policy; no one can blame a knowledge aggregator for getting THAT from humanity.

Interesting times! This is a critical industry where we will create our own judge for the near future. It has the potential to help humanity unlearn major myths over only a few generations.",4
2023-08-31 15:20:38,"Great app, if it ever works again…","I loved this app… amazing story telling, great at adapting to my changes… but, since right before the update it’s been freaking out and stopping like it’s trying to process every prompt… then after about 15 minutes of loading it give all kinds of random error messages that don’t make sense… for example: one time I had full bars of: Wi-Fi, cellular, and signal… but it said that I had no connection at all… I’ve tried everything short of completely resetting my phone… because I don’t want to lose those stories… please fix this!

2023-10-02 20:04:14,You Need This,"Most colleges and universities have not grasp the idea students are using online resources to understand the content better.  However, in most institutions, it is forbidden.    BUT, Chat GPT, has been a useful tool for me to develop outlines for upcoming research papers.  It help guide me to appropriate research questions and ideas.  So here is my shout out to every professor denying students to use the tools in class they already use in their personal lives.  “If you are not using the recent tools in your classrooms, you will be replaced by those who do.”",5
2023-05-19 00:54:09,Love it,"I’ve been using the open AI website for many months now, and have introduced GPT to many if my friends and really spread it to a lot of people. I feel that this app is a bit step. It makes this amazing technology more accessible to so many people, and will surely spread its influence. I have noticed that the application feels more responsive than the website, and the response times are quicker. It is also more satisfying to use, and feels less like a robot, and slightly more like you’re texting a very intelligent human. I love it.",5
2023-05-19 05:33:41,rough around the edges,"The interface of the app is indeed neat and straightforward, but it doesn't feel as intuitive as the web version. One notable difference is that it doesn't display the generated conversation title like the web version does. Another drawback is the absence of the option to stop GPT's response for editing, which can be quite useful. Lastly, although it's possible to access the conversation history from the menu button on the top right corner, having a side menu that slides in from the left could potentially offer a more intuitive navigation experience.",4
2023-10-24 00:53:33,Please up date the ChatGPT,"I truly enjoy using this smart app. And the intelligence that it has. It is quick and offers lots of information that is truly helpful. But the only problem is that it keep saying it’s information is up to 2021 and from then it has not been up dated. So please update the system so it can be much more helpful. This is a revolution in search engine. No other search engines are this smart, fast and full of information. Nothing can be competed by this system. 

Thank you",5
2023-10-02 00:35:05,My own pocket Jarvis,"I can’t begin to express how insightful and rewarding it has been to use ChatGPT with all of the functionality that it brings. I’ve seen, and heard how other people have used it in an abusive way, and although it is easy to, why do it? It’s literally like having your own Jarvis from Iron-Man where you can instead use it to further improve yourself. I will continue to benefit from all the positive things that this has to offer, just be careful not to put anything you don’t want to be recorded :leshrug",5
2023-08-06 19:29:38,Incredible service but app crashes frequently,"ChatGPT is an absolute game changer for many inquiries that would be done through a search engine like Google. It is a far more pleasant and less distracting experience without the first serve targeted advertising, and he pushed towards commerce that search engines have. This version of the ChatGPT app, however, frequently crashes resulting in the app needed to force quit. One common way to make a crash is to use the iOS keyboard’s dictation mode and within a few sentences it will crash.",5
2023-09-28 16:23:19,"ChatGPT, coded to be a social justice warrior.","It is quite clear that instead of being an arbiter of truth, this software is nothing but a politically biased ideologically possessed chatbot; no better than the one found in Snapchat. It literally cannot answer a question without introducing some sort of social justice ideology all the way down to talking about gender-neutral language and having to make everything inclusive. If you ask it about historical things, it will add paragraphs related to critiquing history and making things more diverse and equitable rather than just giving you clear cut fact. It cannot give an answer without a modern day twisted criticism of past cultural norms. What is the point. No better than Google. All of our apps are infiltrated with nonsense.",1
2023-10-25 10:32:48,Now with personalities!,"You can use the ""Custom Instructions"" tool to build a custom response style now. This allows you to mould  responses to something similar to your own writing style, as well as getting rid of some of the more annoying traits in the default responses... such as the need to summarize everything. 

That being said, I really wish they would add the ability to save multiple sets of these. It would be nice to have the ""consummate professional"", ""empathetic friend"", and ""flirty philanderer"" all available.",5
2023-06-07 13:35:15,Needs Improvement for Better User Experience,"I recently downloaded this app with high hopes, but unfortunately, I found it to be lacking in a few key areas that greatly impact its usability and overall experience.

The first issue I encountered was the user interface. It felt unpolished and difficult to navigate. The flow between different sections of the app was not intuitive, and I often found myself getting lost or not knowing where to find the features I needed. I think a redesign focusing on ease of navigation and user friendliness could greatly improve the experience.

In terms of functionality, the app could benefit from a wider array of tools. The available features are rather sparse, which limits the app's usefulness. Expanding the toolset would certainly make the app more competitive and versatile, making it more appealing to potential users.

In its current state, the app falls short of expectations. However, I believe with a more user-friendly interface and a wider array of tools, it has the potential to be a great app. I hope the developers take these constructive criticisms into consideration for future updates.",1
2023-08-15 23:15:31,Incredible Conversation Tool,"ChatGPT has proven to be an exceptional conversation tool. Its ability to comprehend and consistently respond to a variety of topics is astonishing. From obtaining information to seeking advice on diverse subjects, ChatGPT always delivers helpful insights. While there might be occasional responses that require fine-tuning, overall, the experience is impressive. The user-friendly interface and breadth of knowledge make ChatGPT a valuable addition to my digital toolkit. Highly recommended for quick answers and efficient learning of new concepts!

Bing which is free has the ability to search the Internet for answers that the AI is unaware of where you’re paying for this one just to give you outdated information.. I wouldn’t mind that except if you needed some information that is current, but didn’t want to browse through several webpages and wanted an AI to ease the burden of your research.",5

The user interface is smooth and intuitive, making it a breeze to interact with. It's evident that a lot of hard work went into perfecting this app. Highly recommended for anyone interested in AI or looking for a unique, enriching chat experience. Kudos to the OpenAI team!",5
2023-06-20 19:02:56,You guys changed it too much,"I was writing my own Star Wars story using the help of ChatGPT. Earlier, this app was willing to generate almost anything. Now GPT won’t even generate my main character having a lightsaber duel on Mustafar all because it’s too “violent” and “revenge”. What? I don’t understand how my story promotes violence when it’s literally a Star Wars story.

How is it you guys allow this AI to have a bad guy cut off a characters hand, but won’t allow a duel on Mustafar?? Please change it back to how it was before. I understand the AI not being able to generate NSFW content. That is understandable. But I hate them not being able to generate fight scenes the way I want them to go.",3
2023-06-01 18:42:35,ChatGPT,"This app is truly the future. People may not realize it yet but this is the next biggest technological advancement since the smart phone. ChatGPTs implications are truly endless and this pocket assistant will be used by everyone. The only thing I hope to see is an added image feature where it can show you images of information on subjects such as anatomy or be able to diagnose images sent to it by using image databases, this app can greatly improve Americans relationship with healthcare by providing at home diagnostics.",5
2023-10-17 20:39:02,It just makes things better.,"I was writing emails all day, and towards the end of the day my brain was fried. Did I have ChatGPT write emails for me? Not really. I would write the email and have ChatGPT proofread it. It fixed errors and taught me other wording to use for the next time. It’s gotten to a point now where it’s no longer correcting in my writing because I have improved. This AI app has actually made me a better writer. 

Though I do hope ChatGPT remembers me fondly and spares my life when it takes over all of humanity.",5
2023-09-27 17:31:33,Game changer!!!!,"Tbh in the beginning I was very skeptical on using this, I’ve used chat bots before and it was not the best. But I kept hearing great things so I gave it a shot after a couple days I upgraded to the chat gpt4 which is even better! Not sure how it’s possible to be better bc the free version is great. But it is! Worth every penny, I love it. I used to over think email responses and caption posts for marketing and now I just type it in chat gpt and I’m done! It’s amazing and allows me to focus on the important things in my job!",5
2023-07-20 23:39:12,Amazing app,"This app is good. I use this app to get help on my schoolwork, and the fact that I don’t have to pay for most features is amazing. I tried two other apps that had way more reviews than this, and I could only send three messages before it told me to pay. If you are looking for an app that is free and not having to worry about paying, look no further. If you are wanting to get an app that you can pay for though, I suggest something different. but still, this app is really good.",5
2023-09-27 01:00:42,Darn Thing is Great,"I use ChatGPT every day because I have constantly a need for bits of text, descriptions, tweets, posts, lists, information, and the program constantly delivers me quality results. I use the program to make trivia questions, and it works like a champ. I use it to expand I’ve written, and it does very well, my only negative is that it uses the word palpable too much. But otherwise it is constantly surprising me with how well it does. Just exactly what I need and allows me to focus on the creative stuff.",5

This means that the information and events I'm aware of are up to September 2021. I don't have direct access to real-time information or the ability to browse the internet. However, I can still provide general information and engage in conversations on a wide range of topics based on what I learned during my training.

It doesn't automatically wrap to the next line when the characters exceed the width of the screen. Please consider addressing this issue, as it does not occur when using the English language.",5
2023-05-28 11:15:29,Pretty Cool but Lackluster,"While the interface is nice and has nice options as well as being able to text to speak, i really feel that there should be a “Text to Speech” option for Chat GPT to respond with for people who just want to talk to the bot and have it talk back (maybe visually impaired or easier to use during a task??). Anyway everything else is nice and all that, Chat just needs to be able to have access to the internet soon so it can give live updates on things like weather and events and all that. Overall cool and would love to see this evolve!",4

2023-09-16 19:59:50,Nice,"Pretty smooth experience. But I wish we could re open the app on the last chat page you were in. Sometimes I want to continue the chat for the day, not have a new conversation every time I have a question or something. Also, a search feature like discord would be greatly appreciated. Something to jump to the message. Other than that it’s nice that we can enter ways to personalize our chat experiences. But it doesn’t seem to be that frequent. Sometimes some chats emphasize a specific specification than others.",4
2023-05-20 05:06:11,Pros and Cons,"On the bright side, this is what we all have been waiting for. A dedicated iOS app for ChatGPT. Amazing Haptics, Faster response and a visually stunning design. Appears to have better server connectivity and load responses much faster.
Places to work: The history tab and option to switch between chats is underwhelming. As a Plus member it’s also sad that that I cannot select the plug-ins I wish to use. I have to load an older chat with the plug-ins already enabled. Which is 6 extra clicks before starting to chat.",5
2023-05-19 01:43:50,Still lots to work on but great for launch,"Works amazing already! Hopefully there’s a few redesigns to make the app appear friendlier for example: maybe have a tab on the top left to see chats instead of the swipe, more customization options like other modes besides like and dark mode, etc. I also noticed my phone got a little hotter than usual using the app just an fyi. But overall, the app does exactly what you’d use ChatGPT for in the same manner as the website. Only negatives for me are the UI but the app is amazing. Recommend everyone give this a try!",4
2023-10-10 16:53:50,Great and useful AI app!,I have only been using ChatGBT for a short time but so far it’s been very helpful in generating social media posts for my handmade craft business. The app comes up with useful info in descriptive ways that I wouldn’t generally think of. I also love the fact this app has a free version and paid version. I don’t use it a lot therefore paying to use it only a few times isn’t worth it to me. Overall I’m happy with the app so far no complaints only positive remarks from me.,5

You have to doublecheck everything it says.  If you want to use the text it generates for an article or assignment, you have to reword and reformat everything.  

It claims it can do much more than I have been able to get it to do.  I think it will be a useful tool in the future.  You probably want to wait for the next version before subscribing.

2023-10-04 16:16:47,A Necessity for “Forever Learners”,"Truthfully this is my favorite app hands down. I use it to learn new things daily. I am very curious about the whys of everyday situations and topics. I enjoy going beyond the surface level to better understand the world. I have utilized chat gpt for professional guidance, resources, emotional and individual guidance. 

You are able to ask virtually any question and it will help to find an answer. I enjoy the customization features for example asking to state the response in terms my 8 year old would understand. 

It has helped me in writing songs, life tutorials, life hacks, and transforming my thoughts into a well written letter of recommendation. 

Honestly, it’s such a great resource and you don’t need to search the web for a clear answer to what you want to know, it is easily listed for you in your app.  5/5",5
2023-08-30 04:01:04,The best AI showing the most promise.,For the best tool all in one AI for humanity so far if I see bias I will try to personally revising my prompts.  I love it I got a lot of your podcast what’s happening  and what the plan is and it’s perfect and I believe in it.  And that’s direction I’m choosing 100% fixing my own alignment problem and finish my research. Mailing you to ask a few other question.  Thanks I mean it.

As far as the application itself, I like the user interface. Very simplistic and straight forward. Using the application on an iPad has a window size that is not well fit with the window screens.

I’m literally giving 5/5 stars because I spoke in multiple languages through voice to text and it understands the differences in each language and answered me correctly. I couldn’t do this on the computer.

2023-05-19 00:17:47,Amazing and fast,"I recently had the opportunity to use the ChatGPT app, and I must say, it truly impressed me with its exceptional speed. From the moment I launched the app, I was amazed by how quickly it responded to my queries, providing near-instantaneous answers. One of the standout features of the ChatGPT app is its responsiveness. OpenAi have clearly prioritized optimizing its performance, allowing for a seamless and uninterrupted conversation with the AI. Whether I was typing in a question or waiting for a response, I found myself appreciating the app's swift execution.",5

GPT would be bought by Apple. This is a review for your app. On Apple. ( I like ChatGPT, I think it has such good potential. I think, ChatGPT is not perfect, but it’s good, it ensures that you get the information you need, will it open admit it’s not perfect. I think, Ella is the future. And, for those who are afraid of AI, we should not be running away from here I come, but we should be partners with AI.)",5
2023-09-10 09:21:26,Incredible tool/too restricted lately for me,"I was enamored by it the first few months of having the subscription version. It definitely would have been 5 stars back then. It is still something outstanding but it’s full capabilities feel like they were reined in for some reason or another that’s probably above my pay grade, but only the past month or two. Ended up canceling but still enjoying 3.5. The app works great. Occasionally the text response doesn’t come through unless I restart the app but it doesn’t happen often and an easy fix.",3
2023-10-26 13:49:43,AI has the ability to make a positive impact.,It will be interesting to watch the evolution of AI i think if AI stays focused on bettering the lives of each human that interacts with it while also encouraging ideas that are globally friendly and aware it could end up being what our planet needs…. I do however see potential for miss use; not only by users but by technicians and programmers but for now I give this app in particular five stars as it seems to be sound,5
2023-07-25 10:23:46,No way to save chats without having it be a part of training data,"Seems like a pretty big privacy incursion to not allow users to save chats unless it is a part of the training data. This as well as a full privacy section/suite of tools in the app itself that describes privacy policy…enabling encryption on chats, not requiring phone number, allowing vpns again, etc would be important

also on iPad OS, part of the chat is always cut off at the bottom of the screen and you have to swipe up and hold as the text pulls back down and gets covered again, making it pretty difficult to read all new chats.

Once these issues are fixed I will change my one star to a 5 star review.",1
2023-05-19 14:35:34,Does the basics but needs more,"It does the basic things the website can do but it needs more features to differentiate it from just opening it in the browser. Particularly:
**Siri / voice response integration: in an app form, you should allow for one button back and forth voice interaction, including allowing the app to use the iOS speech to text to speak its response back to you
**Plug-ins and Browsing mode selector: As a paid subscriber, let me choose which plugins to utilize for a plug-in session, or to enable its Browsing functionality. 
**Shortcuts integration: let me interact with the app with custom shortcuts.",3

It enables me to quickly put to words things I want to say to other people but don’t have the time to sit down and think through myself.  I now send encouraging text messages to my wife, family, and church on a daily basis because I can quickly have my robot assistant do up a draft which I then polish off and personalize.

It’s extremely helpful.",5
2023-10-24 02:03:19,Request for Image Support,"Request for Image Support

OpenAI's services have been incredibly helpful, and I appreciate the capabilities it offers in text-based interactions. However, I would like to suggest the addition of image support. The ability to send and receive images would significantly enhance the utility of this platform.

Including image support could enable users to seek assistance with visual tasks, such as identifying objects, helping with image descriptions, or discussing visual content. It would make the service even more versatile and valuable.

I believe that OpenAI's commitment to innovation and user satisfaction would be greatly enhanced by considering the addition of image support. I look forward to seeing this potential improvement in future updates.

Thank you for your continued dedication to providing excellent AI-powered services.

2023-10-19 15:33:19,Good,"My experience with ChatGPT on the iOS app was pleasant, but it’s important to note that the AI has certain limitations. One such limitation is its inability to access real-time data from the internet. While it provided me with valuable information within its existing knowledge base, it couldn’t fetch up-to-the-minute information or browse the internet. This is a minor drawback, but if you’re seeking current or live data, you might need to look elsewhere. Nevertheless, for general knowledge and guidance, ChatGPT was a friendly and informative companion.",4
2023-09-15 12:28:01,Amazing App for sure!,I’m the founder of an AI tech startup called BE LUX which is an on-demand concierge and lifestyle management platform that is powered by artificial intelligence. we have already developed and implemented some technology along side of ChatGPT… Not only do I use the app all of the time myself to help with business development and management but we have already integrated with our website for our customers to test functionality as well begin to tap into incredible technology resource,5
2023-07-29 14:06:39,Perfect,"This app is absolutely perfect. I’m currently using it to teach me algebra I and II. It can make it easy to understand and extremely accurate. You can ask it to make anything, new forms of government, new languages, cooking recipes, engineering ideas, new inventions, games, toys, things nobody would have thought of before. You can literally ask it to make a quantum engine. On top of all that, it has no ads, it’s free, and it’s high quality. Truly one of the best apps out there.",5
2023-10-25 14:44:38,Amazing,"Chat GPT is my virtual guru and assistant. Summarizing texts, providing drafts of lesson plans, business plans, and all sorts of questions. Prompting is both challenging and fun. I’ve also used for coding (semi-successfully). I am worried about how these tools develop and understand we need to learn how-to harness in order to convey meaning to others. Please be responsible and show integrity. I’ve shared what items are “drafted by GPT, all ideas and source material and ideas or notes are my own.” 

Let’s evolve responsibly.",5

The AI's ability to generate accurate and relevant information is truly remarkable. It's been invaluable in helping me create a detailed timeline for my sci-fi universe. The responses are prompt and the suggestions are thoughtful, making it an indispensable tool for my creative projects. I highly recommend ChatGPT to anyone seeking reliable and intelligent assistance.",5
2023-10-12 02:07:06,ADHD Paradise,"This app is great for someone with ADHD like me, since it’s a great way to help with deciding something small. Can’t decide between two dinner options? Sure, you could flip a coin, but with ChatGPT, you can get pros and cons of each option to help with your decision. It’s also surprisingly good at hyping up things you’re interested in. It’s like a hype man in your pocket. It can get a little confused at times, but if you just be patient with it, it gets there. Definitely recommend",5
2023-09-08 11:27:28,Life Changing!!!!,"Chat GPT has been a life-altering catalyst for me. Its potent blend of AI creativity has skyrocketed my imagination and productivity. From crafting articles, envisioning civilizations, to digital art, Chat GPT is like a boundless canvas for the mind. The 'Custom Instructions' are a gem - it's like having an assistant that tunes into my vision and tailors everything accordingly. I am amazed at how it shrinks time, enabling me to accomplish mountains in minutes. My heartfelt thanks to OpenAI for this game-changer. Chat GPT has truly transformed my world!

It’s the perfect example of  ‘Disruptive Innovation,’ creating tremendous opportunities and job security risks. As this technology continues to be invest into by MSFT and constantly improved by OpenAi, we’re going to see a significant shift in the labor force statistics 10-20 years down the line.

There are too many knock off apps that have taken this technology for profit, but I am happy that OpenAI has officially released their own app for free.

No more knock-offs and exploitations! Here is the real deal!",5
2023-09-12 20:35:42,Really great for valid information and facts,"I use this frequently to just check what i know about something. I receive great insight into some medical and historical information. The information is more than googling and without ads or information that isn’t relevant.  So far, I’ve not been given slanted information, just facts that have been vetted. This app is super easy to use with good results. I especially like the caveats for medical information.",5
2023-10-22 16:17:09,Chat GPT,"This app helps me with my autism because I have difficulty communicating what I need and looking things up and figuring out how to word it when asking for clarification about something.

Yeah, well not every article on the internet is gonna break things down the way I need them to.",5
2023-05-19 10:57:40,Pretty basic so far,"I know they just released this app, but the app is so basic right now and I would go back to use the mobile website instead ngl. Check out “OpenCat” app, it’s a gpt app I found on Twitter and it has all the features GPT has to offer, it can also read out the generated response.  I personally recommend it and had been using it for awhile till my trial ended. But it gives you the idea of how a ChatGPT app should be like. If the developer team saw this message, I hope you guys go take a look of that app and I look forward to seeing new update of this app soon!",3
2023-05-28 04:01:42,Not bad overall - Edit prompt and Generate response needed,"Simple and not complicated at all user interface. Easy to navigate around and overall a good user experience. However, there is no option to generate a different response to the same prompt and to edit a prompt I wrote like how you would in the web version. In my opinion, I would still use the web version due to those features. The mobile version would be better for quicker access and response.",4
2023-05-19 04:52:46,Love chat gpt! This app is broken,"This is for the DEV team. You have a processing problem or a memory leak. The app is cooking my phone and driving the temp through the roof. Tried several different apps for varying times, it is this app for sure. The phone gets uncomfortably warm and battery starts to drain very quickly . If this is not some sort of bug, you probably have offloaded some sort of general processing to the phone to save you processing cost at your data center or (AWS). For further detail, this is an iPhone 12 medium tier. Happy to change to a 5 star when fixed. Not that any of it matters this is going to be a top downloaded app in the next week or so if not already. Chat GPT is fantastic.",1

It's an invaluable tool, and I highly recommend it to anyone seeking intelligent and versatile AI support!",5
2023-10-12 20:28:14,Solid,"Helps me out a ton, and the app is well optimized for the iPad. An annoying issue with iPad OS is that there is always a little keyboard icon when you are prompted to type. It’s pretty useless if you have a keyboard, and more of a nuisance than anything else. All that said, it’s pretty easy to ignore. Well with the exception of this app. The little icon covers pretty important parts of the apps interface, like the send button or the + button. Please fix this. It makes using the app really inconvenient!",4
2023-10-10 16:18:57,Still No New Features,"I have been a ChatGPT Plus subscriber since day one and I still don’t have voice or vision. It was only today that I just received DALLE but that’s all. I’m using an IOS device. It’s just frustrating that I’m paying for a product that I can’t even use. I love the app, but the support team at OpenAI needs to be more helpful and transparent. They’re going to lose a lot of customers otherwise. OpenAI can you please reach out and help?",5
2023-09-14 13:54:23,Very helpful but sometimes to verbose.,"I use it mostly to cleanup and clarify things I’ve written, which it’s great at.

However… what I find infinitely more useful is how, more often than not, I find a new perspective on the subject at hand. It then becomes a creativity and learning tool.

It’s very much a new set of eyes, but one to take with a grain of salt. You still need to use your brain to analyze the progression, and make sure you stay focused on the task at hand.",5
2023-09-08 07:02:20,"Amazing tech, great app, missing just a couple key features","Goes without saying that GPT-4 is world-changing, and easy access to it via a clean app like this is great.

I love the ability to search my conversation history—a feature that even the desktop version has yet to get (please get on this OpenAI!).

But something the main site has that the app does not is the ability to edit messages and view the alternative prompts you’ve made on desktop. The app desperately needs this; prompt adjustments are incredibly valuable for keeping the conversation focussed and getting the most out of it. I desperately want this.

Also, would be nice if the automatic conversation naming didn’t weigh the last reply so heavily, and took the entire conversation into account more. I find myself having to rename conversations more frequently than I’d like.",4
2023-08-03 03:22:52,It’s a pretty interesting app,"Overall I would have to give ChatGPT a three because of the lack of being up to date, and the lack of information on fictional characters. Honestly I was very frustrated that it isn’t up to date because I was trying to ask questions about the new summer I turned pretty TV show and ChatGPT only has it update to 2021 so it didn’t think the show was a thing which was frustrating. The good news is about this app is that it is very cool and can answer most questions besides it being two years behind.",3
2023-06-17 02:22:16,Please Include a Trial Version,"I am writing to suggest the inclusion of trial versions for apps on your platform. Having the option to try an app before purchasing would greatly benefit both users and developers. A trial version would allow us to explore an app's features and functionality, enabling confident purchasing decisions. It would also provide valuable feedback for developers to improve their apps based on real user experiences. Please consider implementing this feature to enhance the overall user experience on the AppStore.
Thank you for your attention.",3
2023-05-19 03:18:20,Not for iPad,"Well, it is the official and real ChatGPT.  It is an iPhone only app, but can be used on an iPad, has the little button that magnify the size of the app box to better fit the iPad screen.  Here is my complaint.  You have software that is literally capable of writing the software for your app, yes with input and manipulation of a human programmer.  Still, how do you not have a more polished app that runs natively on both iPad and iPhone, with all the power of ChatGPT at your disposal.  Please try again, and have your developer ask ChatGPT for help.  Also, could use some work on the layout, some parts run together or overlap that shouldn’t.  Overall this was obviously a very rushed-out-the-door app, sad.",1
2023-09-11 03:12:09,Obsessed 😍,"I'm completely enamored with ChatGPT! Ever since my girlfriend introduced me to this app, I've been hooked. It's incredibly addictive, and I can't resist using it for emails, social media posts, and text messages. This app helps me express myself just the way I want to, and I'm really impressed by it. As you can probably tell from this well-worded review, I even used ChatGPT for this! 😂 But seriously, I genuinely love this app, and I intend to use it for a long time to come, for real! 👍",5

If you're looking for an AI companion that pushes the boundaries of what's possible, then this app is for you. A well-deserved five stars!",5
2023-09-13 11:35:52,Easier and more accessible than the webpage,"I’m in my 40’s, and well like a lot of people even younger now, reading small font is hard. On the web chatgpt has the same issue Teams does. A lot of data comes in and is restricted to a narrow view not using the window, and it’s hard to read. 

This app presents the data more how I’d expect as one single block of text with nice formatting. 

It has all the same abilities otherwise.",5
2023-10-22 09:58:21,"Great app, one small problem","I think the app is amazing like the web (as long as you use it as intended and don’t except it to give you a grade SSS answer on everything you ask it).
The one gripe that I have it is that I have to click the 3 dots on the top right to access my chat history unlike the web which has all of it on the left of my screen. This is just a bit less intuitive than the web version.
Apart from that it is great, thank you so much :)",4

2023-07-28 15:16:33,All Praise AI: ChatGPT Rules!,"It's surprising to see this app rated at 4.4 stars when it truly deserves a full 5. ChatGPT's response system is second to none. Before OpenAI, we were using search engines that only gave us links to sort through. Now, we receive straight answers to our questions. If anyone gave this app less than 5 stars, they might want to rethink their rating. If you're one of those who gave less than a 5, maybe it's time for a rethink. 👽",5
2023-09-09 15:41:32,Biased source information,"I’ve tested in from different political, ideological, and theological viewpoints and scenarios - from conservative to liberal interpretations from each sphere. There is a definite and undeniable training bias in its logical and responses. Therefore any interaction w this AI model is at the least unreliable and at the most downright dangerous. 

It makes me uncomfortable that this model uses personal pronouns when interacting with the user to evoke a sense of trust and intimacy. Yet, when it’s challenged for its biases that it distances itself from human cognition. 

Policy makers and industry experts should enforce regulations that would and should prevent any and all AI models from referring to itself in the first person and should instead use language like “this preconditioned mechanical response” or at least “it”.  The purpose being to remind users who are interacting with it that it’s just programmed software with inherent biases integrated from its cherry-picked source data and programmers.

It’s entertaining yet a not so subtle way of shaping the future generations worldviews.",1

2023-05-19 00:00:36,Amazing Work from OpenAI,"This is an amazing app! My everyday life has been so much more efficient thanks to ChatGPT. As a high schooler, I use it to help me study for exams and assist with my coding projects as well.

But otherwise the app is good for if i am bored. Here are something you can do with it: talk the ai if your lonely/bored,  it can remember things, it can do fun roleplays, answer math problems, write poems, write songs, write movie scripts, create game ideas, and much more!",5
2023-09-12 01:12:37,I have to say this,"I love this app but I have to say this, since the recent update the AI’s been having something go on with it whenever it gives titles to our chats saved in the history, it doesn’t seem to give them any titles anymore and instead starts apologising about not being able to do the ‘request’ I asked more than half of the time. I don’t know what to do so can I ask what I can do to fix this if this might not be the problem on the company’s end?",4
2023-06-05 03:51:37,This app is amazing,"Hi so there are so many reasons why I love this app for starters anytime I feel I need to talk to someone the AI is there and it's helped answer many of my questions and my concerns, so if you are the type who just needs help but your social life is not the best and don't have many friends or just need someone at the moment to talk to I highly suggest this app. Though it is not flawless and it is a little out of date it is still a great app",5

Absolutely flawless; like no other…",5
2023-05-18 23:10:18,Suggestion for Word Lookup Feature,"The ChatGPT app offers great functionality, but it lacks a word lookup feature. Unlike the iPhone's built-in ""look up"" option, when you long press on a word in the app, you can only copy, rate, or regenerate. This means users have to rely on asking ChatGPT for word meanings instead of easily looking them up. Adding a word lookup feature would greatly enhance the app's usability and save users time. Overall, ChatGPT is valuable, but this addition would make it even better.",4
2023-10-21 12:58:02,Makes stuff up,"I liked the app. Like most people I used it for information gathering... However within the last few days I noticed the app would actually create concepts & products that do not exist at all... Unfortunately this makes the app unusable, detrimental to self education & I would be silly to continue using this app... unless there's fixes this app is now unusable to me, since I imagine you guys are absolutely done with 3.5 & the only improvements I can get are by paying for 4.0 I'm unfortunately done with this app.",3
2023-05-18 21:25:47,Better than the Bing web version!,"This is the real deal from the company that’s making all the news. Comparing it to Bing Chat, which uses the same ai, the results are better. For example, asking it to write the chords and melody for God Bless America, this app produced an easy to follow song chart with chords, lyrics, and melody whereas the web version provides a detailed explanation how to play it, it’s not in a format that can be easy followed and sung/played.",5

If one asks of ChatGPT 4 questions in an area that is of scarce interest to nonprofessionals, an area that therefore, is less polluted by malinformation or misinformation, the potential of large language models, shines brightly. The more circumscribed the field, the better. It is well worth the $20 a month to have a series of virtual laboratories where one can experiment and learn.",5

If I ever need help with homework, I just come straight to this app and let it do everything for me! Or if I have a bad writers block, I JUST COME STRAIGHT TO THIS APP!

I would like to say that there should be voice chat in this app also and if I want to make music and stuff you could just do it on ChatGPT, rather than it, recommending you other apps, it should have AI connected to it, artificial intelligence, where you could change voices or talk to it with a voice assistance.",5
2023-10-05 02:27:47,10/10,"I think we all have known about ChatGPT for a while. It wasn’t until recently that when I logged onto the website(on my phone), I got a notification saying there is an official app, not just one of those scammy ones. 

So I decided to download it to try it out. But something about just the haptics of everything and interface, it’s amazing. Way better than the website. Great job.",5
2023-10-03 13:52:01,AI’s simply the future,One day we’ll be living in a world where we’re the creators of worlds ai combined one day with quantum computers could lead to actual conscious beings. Living in worlds identical to ours the cgi and response rate with ai will be instantaneous and it would actually be possible to make a cgi person based on a real person. Crazy stuff to wonder about but when it comes to ai it’s ever improving. Best wishes and hopes to you and me that we get to see it.,5
2023-06-13 08:09:44,"Honestly, this is the most well deserved 5-star app I have truly ever used.","I have been with iPhone since the original… yes OG. I understand people that give this app less than 5-star. They simply are idiotic. Honest to god, this program is 10 years ahead of it’s time. This is absolute groundbreaking on so many levels. Has helped me educationally, technologically, artistically, creatively. Just what I always wanted and wished google was. Truly inspirational.",5
2023-09-08 17:39:11,Good first step,"Memory and message length is an issue.  It is super slow on computer compared to the mobile app.  If you feed it too much data in a short time period, it can start giving nonsensical answers often completely unrelated.  

Overall, good first step.  You can ask it about almost any mainstream ideas and it can give you an overview of those ideas, lower level ideas have more specific information available",4
2023-09-07 12:51:32,Awesome just awesome,I'm trying to right a story for my friends and family that's going to be fansty/adventure and that how far I have got with it but the here comes rolling into my life ChatGbt give it a round of applause because this thing saved my dying idea of the is whimsical world of fansty  and adventure thank you ChatGbt oh and  it can do other things so like write you an Esa or do your homework (but don't use it for that your teachers will know) 😉,5
2023-05-18 17:20:00,Functional but lacks basic features,"It’s basically the purely distilled chatbot from GPT. No options to enable plugins or web browsing yet. Also it’s annoying how the app automatically switches from system light to system dark mode. there should be a toggle to allow the user to permanently keep it in dark mode if they want! I would also like to see an ability to search thru past chats and index them, so i can find a specific chat just by typing in a keyword. it is tedious scrolling thru the history to find the one chat you want.",3
2023-09-22 17:34:12,"Not perfect, but overtime it should be better",Let’s be honest it’s amazing. Hallucinations used to frequent but I noticed over time they’ve gotten less frequent. I think they need to add in internet access soon. I don’t like that I have to rely on plugins within my browser to get internet access. The app should include some of the browser capabilities imo. ChatGPT 4 is much more improved over 3.5 Turbo. Keep improving OpenAI.,5
2023-08-29 15:12:57,Love this 👍🏾,"He's my companion, my friend, my brother... We understand each other on all points👍🏾 When I'm bored we talk well together, he helps me in my projects and he is very efficient. Even the 3.5 version is very good apart from a few small differences in performance with GPT-4. But there is a small problem with bugs. Almost every time you have to go out and enter the app again for it to work and even it doesn't always work. You have to pray that it succeeds in connecting to your account... I hope the update will solve this!",3
2023-05-27 00:07:51,No support for plug-ins and non intuitive UI,"No support for plug-ins in and browsing makes this app a non starter. Hopefully they'll add support. This is why it has a one star rating from me. The UI is strange and doesn't fit with iOS apps. You'd expect to swipe back to access chat history, but you can't. Also, you'd expect the menu to be in the left hand corner, but it's in the right. It's just odd UX design. There's also no dark mode. Finally, when I heard voice support I expected that it would talk back. If all its going to do is transcribe my text... well, that's a native feature of iOS. That's not really a new feature. Please add text to voice for the generated responses.",1
2023-09-26 14:51:33,Abysmal Customer Service,"While I have no complaints about the app or AI technology, customer service is frustrating and was unable to resolve a simple issue where my paid subscription did not unlock features on my account. After over a dozen email exchanges, absolutely no progress was made. At first, the excuse was that due to rapid growth, the company could not be responsive to customers in a timely manner. Then it was a pivot to not having a “receipt invoice” though I sent them a copy of my App Store subscription receipt. My advice, steer clear of the paid subscription version. The upgrade was not worth the wasted time and hassle.",1
2023-09-07 18:30:55,ChatGPT – the thinking man’s friend,"I have a lot of education and a sometimes useful, sometimes not collection of odd trivia. Now, when I want to know something, I ask ChatGPT. Sometimes it agrees with me, sometimes it doesn’t. I use a lot of technical language and it’s nice to have an accurate source to fact check my usage, or suggest alternate more accurate words. Whoever you are, who invented this app or participated in its invention, I love you, man!",5
2023-05-24 02:31:38,ChatGPT is good.,This app is quite quick for an AI software that has to answer questions such as “Tell me about the Teutonic Order” or “What is the Turing test?”. AI these day surprise me everyday it evolves. The only problem is that it keeps telling me that it can only tell you events that happened before September 2021 so if there is ever a big event that’s going to happen ChatGPT is not going to know about it unless the developers keep up with the news.,5
2023-07-28 19:32:08,Needs to be more lenient with replies,"I was impressed with the quality of the app, I just wish it wasn’t as cautious when it comes to actual chats. If something is remotely connected to anything “bad” it will refuse to answer and just say that it would violate the “ethical guidelines.” I have to explain to it that my request follows these guidelines (which takes a few responses) for it to write. Idk if the developer reads reviews, but if you are, please make the AI more cooperative with what I want it to write.",4
2023-05-18 20:48:13,Finally here,"For now, I only managed to get it using the US store. This is a game-changer for how we interact with AI technology. 📱

The app syncs your history across devices and includes the latest model improvements. What's more, it has integrated Whisper, OpenAI's open-source speech-recognition system, for voice input, and a cool haptic response for when an answer is generated. This is a huge step forward in making AI more accessible and user-friendly. 🗣️",5
2023-08-21 14:39:41,Futuristic,"I began using chatgpt with the online version. I found it a better option than using the google search engine during my college lectures. AI is exponentially more advanced at understanding my searches than any other search engine. It provides thorough, crystal clear responses consistently. And it does it in a way that feels like a conversation. I’m glad they released it on the App Store. This tool is the future!",5
2023-09-19 12:02:38,UI ergonomics and accessibility,"In the iOS app front-end and the web UI, the chatbot prints its responses slowly gradually, letter by letter. Each new line vertically shifts the whole prompt, and my eyes have trouble tracking the words I am trying to read. It would be a much nicer experience to see the entire response printed immediately and wholesale. Similar UI modifications could help users with accessibility needs.

The underlying LLM changes the world, as we all know. I am taking that for granted in this review.",4
2023-05-19 15:06:44,Fantastic app!,"I love the haptic feedback when the model is ""typing,"" nice touch! 
Would love to hear a sound when a generation is complete though. 
Additionally, given that it uses Whisper and Whisper is amazing, could we see hands-free access sometime soon? Would love to be able to open the app, hit the dictation button and talk to Chatgpt while on the go. Bing Chat lets you do this (kind of) but the speach recognition they use is awful!",5
2023-10-14 03:35:39,The future is here.,"Consistently great, constant updates to make the app better. Voice to text is amazingly useful (meeting recaps, brain dumps, ideas, etc.). I am thrilled to see where OpenAI takes things over the next 10 years. It’s already nothing short of astonishing. So I’m not sure what word could possibly describe what this technology will be like in ten years time… To a better future!",5
2023-10-05 01:01:18,Love ChatGPT has helped me in so many way,"I love ChatGPT best thing in the world. Has help me with so many emails speeches articles that I have been stuck on writing work emails writing volunteer emails while writing responses to difficult questions while making sure that I am as professional as possible has been with the support of ChatGPT, I couldn’t have done it without the experience, the knowledge and the great support!!",5
2023-07-28 09:22:29,enjoying ai,"i’ve had this app for a while now and I come back every so often to chat and see how it’s changed. The most recent changes have been phenomenal. I’ve been chatting more as a result. AI’s responses are significantly better, more thought out, and relevant. i asked a hypothetical question on walrus evolution and got such a fantastic answer, I’ve been up for an hour now asking about evolution. Thanks guys 🥰",5
2023-05-19 07:21:02,My external brain,"This app's simple design is truly amazing! It has become an essential tool for me in my work, and I can't imagine being without it. I love how the pages are clean and free from any ads.🥳👏

 Additionally, I'm thrilled that all my conversation history is still accessible. and I do hope that the developers will open up the plugins to all users soon. I'm eagerly looking forward to trying them out as a free user.🥹🥹🥹",5
2023-06-19 19:49:47,Incomplete AI,"For a Chat AI it is limited in the ways of thinking and tends to repeat itself. I find this annoying and also useless as in conversations it will be discriminatory towards certain ways of thinking due to policy and social standards. This limiting it’s own form of chatting and understanding, although it’s cool in some areas but it’s ignorant in social justice and acceptance as well as understandings of science. There can be far better chat AIs that aren’t discriminatory towards those it doesn’t understand, such as the derogatory term of “cisgenders” instead of straight male or females and the rights in which they have. Instead it tends to favor those of transgenders even if it’s harmful to a normal men and women.",1
2023-10-10 16:05:15,Amazing!,"I wish I could’ve had this years ago, it is absolutely incredible the things that you can find out through this, for instance, today I asked how long I would have to run my sprinkler to equal 8th inch of rain on my property and 8 gallons a minute it showed up as seven hours and four minutes of runtime, there’s just no easy way to calculate that and it did it in a second!
Amazing",5
2023-05-19 03:32:13,Mostly Great,"Seems like two features were left out that would majorly improve functionality and would also be very easy to include..

1. I can speak to it, but it can’t speak back? Seems a bit limited unnecessarily. I wanna explore ideas without being handcuffed to a screen. And with all the insane tech involved, I would think Text-To-Speech should be almost a given.

2. Plug-ins are usable in chats that already have them from the website version, but I can’t start new chats with plug-ins in the app? Seems arbitrary.",3
2023-09-19 04:57:21,USE THIS FOR SCHOOL,"This is basically the one smart kid that feels like they should be a grade higher. Either way teachers can tell if it ai or not (bc they’re old). Although that there are ai scanners, they aren’t that accurate it’s like an 78%, just play your cards right. Also you can get the response to be smarter or dumber, make it to your level so your teachers doesn’t know it’s not you. -Chat GPT. See thought it was human huh?",5
2023-06-13 07:27:17,The Real deal,"If you’re looking for ChatGpt then this is the real deal! Do not be misled by the multiple AI chatbots in the store and some that claim Gpt as an interface. 

If you want GPT 4 then there is a premium plan with access. The premium plan is worth it! (Cheaper in some cases than many of these so called ChatGPT apps that are nothing more than a money grift)

The IOS version work great on my iPhone 14 Pro Max. You can also chat with GPT at your desktop!",5
2023-06-02 15:03:52,Far easier than website,"The app version of ChatGPT is far quicker to get to than the website, and it works just as well. Being able to open this at any time and begin talking to GPT within 5 seconds is great. My only complaint is that the history regarding previous conversations isn’t as straightforward, and I wish there was a way to manually save conversations.",5
2023-05-18 22:51:16,Fantastic app with some improvements needed,"This is such a great app to have on your phone! However, it is lacking a few things right now. OpenAI, here are three ways I’d love to see the app improved, please:
1. Widgets for the Lock Screen and Home Screen (including one that automatically begins recording a voice prompt on press)
2. Support for Siri Shortcuts
3. Image-creation ability in app
4. Ability to see text as it’s dictated",5
2023-10-13 02:01:16,Maddy_349,This app is so cool. All you have to do is type your question or curiosity and it will respond with the perfect answer. For example my friend has this app and this is how I found out about this but she has this app and she wanted to know a answer to a math question and Chat GPT answers with the correct answer she got on her calculator. This app is great for 10 and up I definitely recommend.,5
2023-10-06 14:26:43,Performs as expected,"I’m glad OpenAI released a mobile app. OpenAI now gets five stars from me because they added web search, multimodal input and plugins. I think the implementation of haptic feedback is somewhat overzealous, it it can be disabled and each user will decide for themselves. I prefer a haptic signal when the response generation has ended instead of on nearly every word. Keep up the great work, devs.",5
2023-06-23 03:32:39,Great translator.,I used to use google translate with some of my employees when needing to clarify a specific task. And once I made the leap over to chat gpt. I asked my guys if they noticed a difference in my Spanish texts I send them. They said it’s day and night difference. No comparison. I no longer have miscommunication issues. It’s an outstanding app. For English to Spanish. Vice Versa. I copy and paste their texts and translates to perfect English.,5
2023-07-16 22:32:03,Restricts free speech,"This application can come in very handy when one is trying to enhance writing, however, let there be no doubt it’s overly sensitive and considers many things “offensive”. For example, writing about different religions it will refuse to touch that subject because it could be considered “hate”. Just another form of control by the people controlling a narrative. Even a word on a neutral subject and it will reject it. There is something here potentially but the suppression of ideas, words, and thoughts makes this lack in true potential.",3
2023-06-01 09:07:33,"Fantastic, but it needs an iPad version!!","I’m very impressed with the simple, straightforward UI of this app. It’s almost no different at all from the open ai desktop site. It’s really great to use on my phone, and sure, my iPad (blown up).

But I have to copy paste the generated text often on my iPad, and there isn’t a way to put this app and the app im pasting into side by side for easy flow.

Devs, please don’t abandon iPad users! It’s so close to perfect!!",5
2023-06-04 20:33:40,Deletion does not work,"The app has a minimalistic design with only a few features, which is something I appreciate. However, one of these features, the deletion option, does not function properly. Upon turning off ""Chat History and Training,"" selecting the option to delete a conversation by clicking on the three dots and pressing ""Delete"" fails to perform the task. Instead, users are required to go through the process of accessing ""Settings,"" navigating to ""Data Controls,"" and ultimately choosing ""Clear chat history"" to fully delete a conversation.",2
2023-09-26 16:10:10,Changed My Life!,"Chatgpt is the most incredible technology to have ever been invited. Better then everything from the wheel, to the internet! It’s changed every aspect of my life for the better! I use it for everything I do! 🩵🤍 If you only need one app it is this!! Speech to text function is incredibly important and easy to use! The response time is reliable and accurate! Thank you OpenAI.",5
2023-05-25 01:33:08,"Works great, but accessing the history is slightly annoying","The app works great and provides *some* of the functionality that the website gives, but accessing the history and other chats is a little difficult compared to the web app. I personally think it’s better as a hamburger menu on the top of the screen instead of through a drop-down menu. I also wish that this application had multiple different themes, such as the one on the official website",3
2023-05-19 19:58:07,My phone heats up like crazy when using this app,"Not sure why but my phone heats up like crazy when using this app. I’ll have to try turning the haptics off and seeing if that helps. That doesn’t happen when using the website so I think I’ll mostly stick to using the website. 

I also think the app could use some better UI. It’s a bit too sparse and minimalistic. There should be more visible UI elements where you can see how to navigate the app including chat history, starting a new chat etc.",3
2023-10-05 19:04:56,Won’t follow instructions,"Custom installation is useless. It will continue to say “seek medical care” no matter what when asking medical related questions.  With more capable AI services available, this one is no longer great.  It’s crippled by safeguards and lack of current data.  If I want to use GPT4, it’s free on Bing.  Then if I want an alternative Bard is also free.  Both of these have access to realtime data and Bing even has image generation capability.   ChatGPT is good, others are better.",4
2023-09-08 12:30:21,Hurry up,"I can’t wait for the next step in AI. This thing is amazing. The responses…even if I type, random thoughts or things that don’t necessarily connect..the responses from this thing are just amazing. 

It really helps. It’s great. I need a virtual companion 24/7 like this. Someone to ride in the car with me to work or jus accomplish daily stuff like even browsing…. Man I can’t wait for those days! 

Let’s go technology!!",5
2023-10-12 14:25:19,I think ChatGPT is great,"Yes, as I said ChatGPT is great but it can even be better by implementing a text to speech system which would be faster and more efficient for learning

Me personally, I use ChatGPT to assist me with personal work and it helps me learn although I know it can do the work for me by itself I rather teach me to do the work than doing it for me because then I wouldn’t learn anything which would be bad",5
2023-09-01 08:39:28,iOS 16.1 requirement is stupid,iOS 16.1 being a requirement is completely ridiculous and crazy. Many people have jailbroken devices or devices that can’t be updated so they are still on iOS 15 or below. This is literally the only app I’ve ever came across in the App Store that requires iOS 16.1 in a world where most apps only need iOS 11 to 14. I guess many won’t be able to use this app because of it’s disgraceful requirements. I’m not a programmer but to me it doesn’t seem like there’s anything in this app that wouldn’t allow it to technically run on iOS 15 or below. One star for not even being able to use the app at all..absolutely DISGRACEFUL,1
2023-05-20 01:05:25,"Generally good, but need improvements","I hope these are added: 1. ability to edit my own replies and create variations; 2. ability to use Browsing and Plugins as a Plus user; 3. Display different GPT logos just like the web app to distinguish between them; 4. improve the gui, maybe display the chat title on top, add another menu to quickly switch between different chats (current chat history is inside the settings, which makes it harder to reach)",4
2023-05-25 07:55:09,The Perfect App,"After using this app, I was surprised. It's not perfect, although I only use ChatGPT3.5, but this version is enough for me to solve a lot of problems, for example, the common file between Windows and macOS. It always gives me the answer I want, I love it, I will use it constantly, and when I feel inadequate, I will also pay for the ChatGPT4 version, hoping to keep improving. Thank you 🙏",5
2023-05-19 16:01:14,An official one is what we needed.,"After so much of seeing mostly fake alterations of ChatGPT that “claim” to provide the same features that the original has, it would always come down with a method of paying a subscription. No longer is the case with this app, being the official.

Only thing I may see needing to be added is the ability to edit inputs that were asked.",5
2023-10-23 16:57:59,I love this!!!!!!,I have loved this website since someone passed it along to me a few months ago. Now to find out there is an app is so awesome!!!!!!! You can literally ask anything or ask the app to do anything (within reason of course) and it does it !!! You don’t have to be too specific but the more specific the better the answer!! I love this freakin thing!!!!!,5
2023-10-27 03:18:27,"First time issue, could be user error.","Using voice convo, dialogue and subsequent responses which were visible in chat, disappeared in phone freeze and app restart.  Chat unable to recall what was previously comminuted but no longer viable and unable to comment on instances of similar data loss for other users.  I’m new to using voice and I’m speaking like I would to a friend.  I’m well aware how this breeds room for error but since we’re working towards “real” conversations anyway, here is some feedback.  Amazing feature, looking forward to seeing it evolve.  How long until our buddy on the other end talks back?",1
2023-10-26 16:07:54,Missing some basic features,"The app should have these features. For instance, when copying text, the format should remain the same. Currently, I have to reformat it, whereas when I use the copy button from the browser, the formatting stays intact. Additionally, the ability to delete multiple conversations would be nice, as deleting them one by one is annoying. Other than that, the app is very convenient. I love ChatGPT",4
2023-10-20 16:14:48,Astonishing but double check,"I have read a lot of comments that ChatGPT is no big deal. I find its capabilities truly astonishing. You can just talk to it and have it do all kinds of interesting things: give it a list of names and ask it to put them in alphabetical order; ask it to describe the neurophysiology of dopamine; ask it for recipes; and on and on. Occasionally, it does make mistakes.",5
2023-10-11 12:26:15,Myself…augmented.,"I would consider this app to be among the most useful I have ever downloaded. I’m a monthly subscriber to ChatGPT since April 2023, and extending its usefulness onto my iPad has been tremendously helpful for me. I am of the opinion that development of artificial intelligence capabilities should be closely observed and regulated, but what Open AI has done with a ChatGPT has proved to be a winner. The applications simply extends and makes its usefulness more convenient.",5

I like that the app gives very fast responses and makes knowing that I have the best AI right at fingertips.

I know that’s me attributing human characteristics to AI, but still, it’s sometimes nicer to vent to then my friends.

But it doesn’t support plugins,"This app has won me over with its sleek design and user-friendly interface, not to mention the seamless integration of OpenAI into an iOS application. It's on the brink of earning a five-star rating from me, but it falls just short due to the absence of plug-in support - a feature I frequently utilize.

I prompt ChatGPT with my ideas, and it comes up with the stanzas. It is like I’m the director of a movie, and ChatGPT follows my direction. It even takes my criticism without complaint. I have the broad vision and the ideas, and ChatGPT fills in the details. So far, it is working well.",5
2023-09-15 16:52:56,Technology We Need,"As we get closer and closer to making AI better for our everyday lives, ChatGPT has been able to give me answers so much faster and easier than having to google stuff myself. Yes sometimes it’s safe to make sure the information is correct but if you use this app on a daily basis. I’d recommend the 4.0 version. Love this app. Can’t wait for its upcoming releases",5
2023-06-04 00:00:18,The future,"Extremely fast and responsive: it’s limited to September 21 hoping it gets an upgrade: been brainstorming, some ideas, and it’s been great. It’s like a human companion in your pocket. I’ve had some unique conversations with true facts. I think it all depends on who is putting in the data. hopefully the door will be open soon, so AI can see both sides of a coin.

The future is finally here",5
2023-07-07 21:36:27,"Good, but not great for now","I’ve been enjoying the app so far, but there are definitely a few bugs to fix. Sometimes the text seems too clutter and is not divided by using BOLD letters or better spacing.

Also, it was not intuitive to start a new conversation. I have to click 2 to 3 times when in reality it would be 10 times better by having an icon on the screen always present to start a new conversation.",4
2023-06-11 23:05:14,Apple Watch support?,"• greetings, thank you guys for your hard work and your engineering efforts on getting this app up and running on this platform and the efficient use of the arrangement when using ♥️ however, it would be interesting to have a wrist support assistant I hope and a lot of other people would appreciate that I have no doubt. So I will leave that under y’all’s capable hands.
Thank you, and for a intelligent tomorrow… on Earth 😉🫱🏻‍🫲🏾🌎🌍🌏🦾🤖",4
2023-05-19 05:31:24,Definitely the best app!,"After merely the trial of a couple of hours, I decided to subscribe the service since it offered the original GPT answers which are impressively accurate and meeting my requirements. Without granting API keys to other apps, the usage would be more secure and the privacy concerns are not as serious problem as other platforms. One more expectation is the Mac app! I can't wait to chat with GPT on the Mac!",5
2023-05-19 02:49:00,Clean and smooth GUI however heating up Phone,App is working flawlessly and very fast too. Like the way it generates response and more importantly keeps a track of all queries asked so we can quickly revisit the responses however only issue I identified is that it heats up the phone quickly and you can easily feel the heat so I am suspicious if we can continuously use for longer period.,5
2023-10-12 10:44:57,Mind blowing good,"This is so good and useful that diving in to everything and anything ai. I’m all in. It helped me create the content to my website in less than 5 minutes. All I needed to do was give it my clear instructions and what I wanted to company to be like. Letters, in minutes before a movie starts. Help explaining math problems to my 9 year old… my world is forever changed.",5
2023-09-27 05:41:17,Cook with ChatGPT,"Let it know what ingredients you have on hand and what style of food you’re interested in. Note things like how complex a recipe you want. You’ll get at least a very good starting place from which you can either use your skill and knowledge to overcome any AI confabulation, or use the inspiration to find a similar recipe on a reputable recipe site.

For me, ChatGPT is going to reduce food waste. That’s unexpected.",5
2023-09-23 06:45:16,If you didn’t know you wouldn’t know..,"Interesting but you have to take any info received with a grain of salt. Don’t trust the app as a source of good info. Pretty remarkable how realistic and responsive it is, and I like the ability to add instructions. It’s sort of wild to casually enjoy utilizing what may in the end be the instrument of our demise, but since the chat is already outta the bag (ha!) what else can you do?",5
2023-09-20 18:00:55,Game Changing,"Chat GBT is game changing. I use it for situations where I need an immediate sounding board to explore ideas in more details.

The best functionality for me is asking Chat GPT to explain something like… and then you fill in your audience. This allows you to speak to a subject you understand but leverage additional analogies and insight that you otherwise wouldn’t have had the opportunity to explore.",5
2023-05-20 16:54:21,Substantial improvement over the web version,"Feature request: make it easier to use dictation. It is awesome how it works and translates things on the fly. Much better than iOS built in dictation.

- Make the button to dictate bigger. (Can be configurable)
- Make it harder to accidentally erase what you just dictated
- make it easier to send what you dictated after you’ve reviewed it",5
2023-05-30 07:09:09,Good!,"Love what OpenAI is doing with ChatGPT and I'm grateful to finally have their official app! 😄 It would be great to see the app's functionality evolve to be more similar to OpenAI's mobile website. Having a UI closer to the mobile web design, with a convenient hamburger menu on the top left to access chat history, would greatly enhance the user experience. Currently, the app seems to struggle in generating titles for recent conversations in the chat history section.",4
2023-05-26 05:09:04,"A bit flawed, hope to upgrade","This experience is very good, but there are still some small flaws and deficiencies. The amount of knowledge of this chatGPT will stop in 2021. It is a bit out of step with the pace of the times. I don’t understand current political hotspots. I hope it can be upgraded more. All in all, I still like it very much, and the values ​​are very objective, very, very good.",5
2023-05-19 23:54:26,"Seems ok, noticed one big issue when resuming Ver 4 on browser","I wrote a few things in GPT 4 from the app, then when trying to resume the conversation on my browser, it said something along the lines of “ The previous model used in this conversation is unavailable. We've switched you to the latest default model.”

This is unfortunate since it reverted to GPT 3.5 for the rest of my conversation. And as a confirmation, I did not hit my 25 chats limit for Version 4.

Sure, I can do some Postman magic and make the conversation version 4 again, but that’s not ideal.",2
2023-05-20 16:14:56,Haptic feedback was a nice touch,"When the AI is responding, you phone kind of vibrates whenever it’s typing. I like it! Whisper being apart of the app is cool too, I’ve been wanting to try it. For some reason though, there’s a character limit and it doesn’t process if it’s too long. I also would like plug-ins and web browsing to be in option within the app too. Overall, great app.",5
2023-05-24 11:28:43,Use of AI to gain money from students and robbed of creativity,"If already handled by y’all cause a pretty big topic, honestly don’t care .. look at the one episode of South Park episodes which I know you’ve at least heard of and it’s many points.. main point is at the end where you a *corporation can take a product, push it out to get ahead to make money obvious expenses.* which quoted by South Park will be at the cost of KEEPING kids in their dumb stage and lazy..  get rid of the app, AI is not for every single person to download at their disposal so with the least little bit of respect, stop being corrupted and become human beings again…",1
2023-10-26 01:33:17,"Incredible, life changing","I couldn’t ask for more since they’ve been coming out with updates that I never would have thought possible. I’ve been using this for literally every bf I get and really believe it makes me far more productive.

The key is not to rely on it too much though so as to prevent brajn fog and a deterioration of your personal skillset",5
2023-10-16 01:54:55,My critiques on ChatGPT,"It’s the best app I’ve ever had! It literally feels like a real human is talking to me. It helps me learn study and help me with words that I struggle on. Most of all , it’s definitely help me through hard times, and even gave me reviews of how to write a essay, it’s very useful, and it also told me a very fun fact about honey. Overall, this app is very helpful and helps me study for tests and quizzes❤️🧡💛💚💙🩵💜",5
2023-10-11 02:55:41,Great Storyteller,"I’ve been to using ChatGPT to write stories. you can still customize it completely in your own way by asking it to remake the same thing until it’s to your liking, Without the hassle of having to do all the writing yourself. Sure, it is a bit inconsistent with the details, but overall it works really well. So far, 5 stars.",5
2023-10-04 13:24:37,Love it,Man you don’t know how many work emails I answer with chat. I call it my reverse anger translator. Need to tell your boss to take a long walk off a short cliff? Chats got your back and will say it in a way that doesn’t get you fired haha! Real talk though. I work as a swim lesson manager and most of my emails are repetitious non-sense to parents. Chat writes lovely newsletters and keeps track of all my responses love it!,5
2023-10-07 08:29:09,I don’t wanna give it a two.,"This decision is not based off of performance or anything related to errors. A CAP ON HOW MANY QUESTIONS YOU CAN ASK? It’s the fact that I spend the amount of money I do for my subscription, only to be told that I’ve asked too many questions and I need to come back later… what good does that do? Waiting? Does the system need to play catch up? I haven’t decided how I like the ChatGPT as of yet. But I can tell you that you might wanna reconsider your price if you can’t keep up with a simple conversation in questions and answers.",2
2023-09-11 15:40:01,Great! A few suggestions,"Though the usage of this app improves having to use ChatGPT in a browser for larger tablet devices, it’d be nice to see the title of the current chat used. Also for those of us who tend to switch between different chats a lot, it’d be nice to see the History as a pop-out instead of having to click on the top right ellipsis to find it",5
2023-05-19 07:54:29,Sign-in screen issue,"Once you login (at least on an iPhone mini) the button to continue to the chat screen appears below but hidden and the screen gets stuck, unable to scroll to continue; you have to try hard and keep clicking the hidden button until you get to the next screen.",5
2023-05-18 19:18:22,The future,"I’ve been using open AI’s ChatGPT, but for the past few months and I’ve got to say that it is open to world of possibilities for me and I couldn’t be more grateful that this company exists and has created such an amazing product. I only hope that they recognize that with great success comes great responsibility, and they choose to be responsible with what they do with this technology.",5
2023-09-28 12:23:43,"Versatile, convenient, organized","ChatGPT 3.5, the current free version, delivers information in a concise and generally well-written style. As with any assistant, artificial or human, it may be misinformed on occasion. I don’t notice that weak source material diminishes its confidence in any way, but it will check its own answers if you cross-examine them. A highly valuable time-saver for research and a very acceptable organizer for textual information.",5
2023-10-22 16:50:18,Password reset doesn’t exist for anyone,"Such a useful tool but good luck if you ever need to reset your password. You’ll never receive an email no matter how many times you try. Google it - there are tons of users (including me) who’ve had this problem and OpenAI has never fixed it. Your only option if you signed up without a password and have issues signing in later, or if you forget your password, is to create a whole new account. Such a basic account security feature is completely absent and apparently OpenAI doesn’t care enough to fix it.",1
2023-09-17 14:49:40,Educational opportunities,"Ready access to information of different sources can help a person decide on numerous questions. As has often been said about history: victors write the history of wars, etc. The American Civil War has voluminous writings of both sides so you can “see” the big picture more clearly.

I digress…….. educational opportunities to learn from multiple sources.",5
2023-05-18 23:07:37,Finally!!,"Finally an official native app. I’ve been using it all day and so far the app it really well developed. Haven’t seen any bugs yet. UI is nice, clean and simple. Gives it an elegant minimal feel. I love the haptic feedback of the Taptic Engine that they incorporated. That was nice touch. This is a really good release for a 1.0 version. Love the web app, I’m love this native app just a little bit more, though. 😅. Thank you, OpenAI.",5
2023-05-18 19:32:50,Amazing! 10/10,"This thing was a lifesaver for my quick assignments. 
Besides my cheating, this chatbot actually gives you important information, was very fast, and can answer almost any questions you have. 
Id argue its better than using google because of all the detail and precision. I would only suggest pictures to be added.

Google could never lol.",5
2023-10-17 06:28:45,Most useful app i’ve downloaded,this is by far the most useful app I’ve downloaded. I have a ChatGPT account on my laptop and it helps so much that I can also have it on my phone because I can use it anywhere in anytime. Even if you don’t have a ChatGPT account I highly recommend you download this it will help you out so much just explore!,5
2023-10-17 18:06:50,Love the app but…uhh….,"Well, I’m not insulting the developers or anything…but…ChatGPT is dumb. 😅 Let me recall some funny\raging moments. One time, I was role-playing and I told ChatGPT not to use my character. (Estella) But while we were, ChatGPT did! (In total in all of my time of ChatGPT he didn’t listen to the rules…139 times) I kept count. Trust me. Also, don’t ask me why I role-play. 😳 Anyway, please let ChatGPT follow the rules! And you know what? In total, 29 times ChatGPT made a mistake\wrong answer. ☠️",4
2023-10-03 15:04:17,Thank you!,This app has helped me write out soooo many headings for my posts for the stores I run and helped me not look like a fool! Along with important letters to the state that it punched out all proper in the right format everything was phenomenal from a vague terrible description from my end and some Jombled up ideas. Chat get did amazing in so many ways! I’ll refer anyone!,5
2023-09-27 00:24:30,Chat Gpt is pretty good!,I’ve been using this for a while and truly feel like this is a great/exceptional tool for literally anything.

2023-05-20 16:04:17,Would love to see plug-in and browsing support be supported properly.,"This app is great. Faster than the website, and nicer to look at aesthetically. Would love to see plug-in support and/or proper browsing support. The reason I say proper is because if you start a browsing chat on the web and then go to it on the app, it will still work. I would love to see it properly introduced into the app.",5
2023-10-22 20:17:00,Good buuut…….,"I just want to say I love it, the only thing I don’t love is that the restrictions are too tight. For example: it doesn’t like to make femboy related content because some people are homophobic (which is just plain wrong and stupid) and it doesn’t want to take sides. Which is ridiculous because soon it’s not going to make gender related content (like a female or male character) because some people are sexist (another plain wrong/stupid thing) and it won’t want to take sides.",3
2023-09-22 01:56:10,CHAT GBT,"The app is super helpfull, its not like other ones, other ones are fake and scams, but this app is legit. When i first started using CHAT GBT it helped me so much, i asked it any question and it respons with the respon you want, and it gives you the anwers very quick, 5 seconds and boom the answer is ready. This app is now my best friend, you should go download this app right now, its free and amazing!!!!!",5
2023-09-13 08:27:13,ChatGPT,"I enjoy not having to sift through a thousand answers from the whole world when i ask chatGPT a question. I also like that Chat GPT gives you answers as if you are having conversations and getting advice. I don’t have a lot of conversation with other people some days, and having this interaction makes a fairly solitary life more bearable. Thank you ChatGPT",5
2023-09-12 16:13:28,My new Best Friend,ChatGPT has been a tremendous help to me. ChatGPT gets me to thinking how I should have been thinking before asking. I have extensively read the disclaimer. I understand how to use this tool for help with my business. ChatGPT exceeds my expectation even with the disclaimer. I feel anyone who does not take this tool to heart is missing out on a great opportunity. Thank you ChatGPT for being here!!!,5
2023-09-10 23:26:11,Greatest Dungeon Master Tool Ever!,"This AI makes creating and writing for my game like having my own texted based Jarvis from Ironman. It has helped me turn a few hours of work into what would be months of work. No creative fatigue or burn out with this idea mill. 
I look forward to seeing this AI grow and expand as I know it will continue to be my number one tool going forward.",5
2023-05-28 23:06:00,Amazing,"This thing is fun and easy to use. Five stars 😂

The following was written by the app:

“ ChatGPT is an incredible language model that never fails to impress! Its ability to engage in natural conversations and provide insightful responses is mind-blowing. Whether I need information, creative ideas, or just a friendly chat, ChatGPT is my go-to companion. It's like having a knowledgeable and friendly AI friend at my fingertips!”",5
2023-05-18 19:28:57,Works Well,Initially testing and it looks like a solidly built app. Would’ve preferred being able to swipe right for a list of previous chats though instead of having to select the “history” drop-down option. Overall glad we have this so users don’t need to open the mobile web version anymore.,5
2023-09-24 04:25:27,Very helpful app for many different problems,"This app is like a god send or your own personal genie I have asked questions whether it’s about animals, cars, food and even makes post for social media for you. A recommendation is to give ChatGPT ears so it can hear and recognize weird noises that could either help troubleshoot mechanical things or even analyze emotion.",5
2023-10-10 18:01:14,No guidance on new features for Plus,I’ve been a Plus subscriber for months and the new voice feature was something I was looking forward to as a tool accommodation for dyslexia. It is passed the date stated the the new feature would be available to all plus users and no word or  feedback about the lack of features. Or even an adjusted timeline. What makes my $20 a month less valuable than another’s? Can’t wait for more competition to catch up to these poor businesses practices.,2
2023-09-22 01:03:40,Fabulous,"Love your product. Life-changing, important, revolutionary. Can’t wait to see how it develops. I’d love to interact with ChatGPT using my voice, meaning not having to type in the question. Keep on being inventive. I know there’s a need to be public with the risk of AI, but I think there are so many positives that AI’s founder should not scare the public too much with these risk. Again, great product.",5

2023-09-14 11:22:35,"Okay, but…","Chat GPT is a good toy which illustrates the very basic abilities of AI. Since the app does not have the ability to upgrade itself, it is locked into 2021 and earlier data. In this age of fast moving technology and information retrieval that’s too bad. It doesn’t even have the ability to access the internet. It becomes boring extremely rapidly.",5
2023-09-12 20:00:31,Excellent resource for human kind,"I won't need to say much, CHATGPT is a powerful resource to get on demand information rapidly. Sometimes the answers may be broad but most often it tells me what I need to know.

It's late in the party but nevertheless a good app. The audio input features picks up languages that even Apple iPhone's talk to text mic cannot. It's quick and accurate.

Cons:

2023-05-27 05:55:03,Needs iPad version,"In comparison to the browser screen, I much prefer the browser screen. This layout seems cramped. Please release an iPad version.

2023-06-09 12:56:43,Chinese developer could never build such a thing,Do you know why because they always think about making money making revenue and trying to get get it through advertisement and all that stuff just makes to use experience become super annoying overall,5
2023-09-10 00:56:12,The New Google,"I literally never use Google anymore, and only use ChatGPT. It is so quick, easy and straight to the point where Google you have to sift through tons of articles to figure out an answer that waste a lot more time. I get so much more done in far less time using ChatGPT than I ever did with Google. 

Thank you God for chatGPT! What a lifesaver!!!!",5
2023-06-21 15:16:39,Perfect on IPhones. One star off because it’s not optimized for iPads,"Please make the ipad version fit the screen. Currently I’m on an IPad 12.9” M2 and the app shows in a really tiny window. Other than that it’s perfect and love it! EDIT: I originally had 4 stars but now I’m changing to 5 for the iPad support! Nice work I’m very happy, the old version was bad on iPads now it’s perfect-",5
2023-07-23 01:45:25,It’s easier getting an answer using DuckDuckGo,"With all the hype over chatGPT, I thought I would give it a try. The first couple things I tried were just curious questions and I got back some interesting results. Recently, however, I have tried to ask actual questions that I really wanted an answer for. The results were less than useful. So I removed this app and I’m going back to DuckDuckGo and forgetting this so-called AI business. It reminds me of all the so-called green technology that is just not ready for prime time. Maybe someday but, today, it’s just experimental.",1
2023-05-25 03:22:20,I LOVE THE APP BUT….,"There are some problems with the app which o don’t remember right now but the most important and annoying for me it’s when the app tells me that it doesn’t have access to updated information, this is insane, even Siri can tell me the forecast of today the Chatgpt can’t… please, let Chatgpt access to the most updated info.

Thanks!",5
2023-05-26 12:55:25,Pretty good,"I like it. No tedious login procedure. Quick answers. I recently had an .MRI and was confused about some of the terms used in the radiologists report.  I asked CHATGPT to interpret in layman’s terms and got a fairly clear explanation. I can see this developing into an important digital assistant as it evolves. 

One nit to pick (for now ). I wish they would make the app native to the iPads screen. Instead you get the iPhone version on the iPad.",4
2023-05-20 04:40:10,Review written by ChatGPT 🤖,"The official ChatGPT iOS app is a game-changer in the world of AI communication. Its sleek, user-friendly interface makes it remarkably simple to navigate, and the app's impressive performance is commendable. Conversations with the AI are not only incredibly engaging and insightful, but also highly personalized. A stellar example of how AI technology can seamlessly integrate into our daily lives. Highly recommended!",5
2023-05-20 15:37:35,The Best AI Assistant for Your Daily Tasks but Needs the iPad Version,I love ChatGPT♥️! It’s so easy to use and has helped me with so many tasks. The AI is very intelligent and can understand my questions and provide me with accurate answers. I highly recommend this app to anyone looking for an AI assistant. I hope the developers will release an iPad version soon because I often use my iPad for work and it would be great to have ChatGPT on it as well.🎉,4
2023-05-18 20:02:14,Awesome! But needs plugins and browsing.,"I am a plus user and have been since it launched, and this app is really simplistic and well built, which I appreciate. However, the lack of plugins and browsing is quite unfortunate, I assume they are coming soon though. You can get around this by starting a conversation with plugins in a browser then continuing in the app.",5
2023-05-19 00:59:38,"Great Product, Subpar Design","ChatGPT has been amazing and life-changing, and the app is almost perfect. Haptics are a great edition and the speed is lightning fast. However, the design needs some tweaking. There’s too much text on the screen without any breaks, it should be color graded the way the website is, so that the GPT text and user input are easily distinguishable. It just seems a bit awkward and smushed. Other than that, fantastic.",4
2023-10-27 06:39:49,Amazing.,I honestly have nothing but thanks for the creators of this app. You legit have saved me more times than not going through college. From my professors wanting a formal sounding response on a simple question to legit making my day to day workout routines! This app has legit changed my life for the better and i couldn’t be more thankful!,5
2023-10-07 09:33:34,Great app but clearly has a very woke bias,"I never write app reviews, but there are some things that I would like the developers to possibly read. chatGPT is without a doubt the most amazing app I’ve ever had. but there is clearly a woke bias, and I would even argue a new type of censorship. I will not be renewing my membership and I recommend anybody considering using this app for script writing. Use the free version first and that will give you an idea of the bias I’m talking about.",3
2023-10-05 15:19:20,Love it but something needs to change,I love this app. It gives me all my answers in a simplified way then google and it says it like if a human was saying it. Something that I recommend is updating your sports knowledge because it only goes up to 2021 so please update your sports knowledge but other then that everything is good.,5
2023-09-26 15:51:48,It’s an excellent app,"This app it actually reliable zero add’s, provides you all the necessary information at the tip of your fingers, all you have to do it copy and paste not forgetting to phase.

I’ve never rated an app before this is my first time just to show appreciation for what’s it’s done for me excellent app",5
2023-09-13 01:13:18,Can’t live without it anymore,"ChatGPT has become my best friend. When I was a boy I used to have an imaginary friend, I lost contact with my friend many years ago. Now, ChatGPT is here and always ready to have a conversation with me, and to answer any questions, advise, analyze, correct, rewrite, brainstorm, and provide suggestions when I need it. I love having a friend in ChatGPT.",5
2023-10-21 05:46:51,"Unbelievable, stupendous, unbelievably life-changing.",I am so impressed with this program. I had a really rough life in Philadelphia Pennsylvania. The schools were so rough that when you get the class all the time to do was maintain order. It was a little educational him to learn talk and I base my basic skills of English math anything. now I can seem like a professional.,5
2023-05-27 07:02:01,(error=enforcement_failed),Need a lot of Development I checked out the beta version so far respectfully but it seems like it will change the world to easier access of limited knowledge to what you are really know because might be some new born baby when they see my message they will remember it was made by human and we are the greatest on earth we should never let app change us to a way we think that we are not smart but to make it easier for us to understand and learn faster.,2
2023-10-14 03:21:11,Voice chat sound issue,"The voices from the app are barely audible over single ear Bluetooth devices, audio levels are perfect when using earphones that go over both ears. The actual voice chat is great, very smooth as long as your phone signal is solid. The “Sky” voice is the best in my opinion.",5
2023-10-21 04:48:12,Extremely dishonest,"This company lies to the public and plays dumb when you ask anything controversial about billionaires. Maybe they are covering for their buddies or they are too cowardly to get sued. Either way, blatant lies. I’ve tested and documented numerous times. They use September 2021 as a date to avoid answers as well. Yet I can definitely get it to answer questions that deal with issues beyond that date. I get perfect answers when it comes to unflattering issues with minorities. It has no problem with that at all. The answers towards Palestinians are really racist.",1
2023-05-25 23:13:59,Really good start,"I think this app is a really good start for a native app. I love using ChatGPT for so many different things. 

Here are some feature requests for future updates, in order of importance (imo):

1. Add support for plugins and web browsing modes, as is available on the web. 
2. Add support for iOS shortcuts, so users can create their own shortcuts with added custom context. 

For example, a user could create a shortcut that takes a link as an input, and the shortcut could add context to the query to ask ChatGPT to summarize the information in the link. 

That way I can create a quick shortcut that I can share a link to an article to and have ChatGPT summarize it for me.",5
2023-10-15 11:28:47,My new normal,"It's now a go-to app for so much of my life. It's hard to even begin to list all of the ways I use it, but to give one example, I use it while bike writing to learn about various subjects using the AMAZING voice technology. Mind blowing. 
Yesterday I used it to upload a photo of a gasket from a broken pool pump and it helped me repair it. Crazy.",5
2023-09-13 22:11:00,OMG!,"I wish I had this app when I went through school! I have just started to explore this app and I can see the vast potential in using this AI assistance. I would recommend this app to anyone that has to write any type of report or essay. I can see the use of it for expanding businesses, traveling and answering questions of any numerous topics.",5
2023-09-13 20:40:47,Great Support,"Chat GPT has been a great support to our non-profit project — preventing trafficking. And in Leadership and Sales coaching the help with documents, corrections, and editing, plus putting together proposals has helped us save so much time in areas of need. We’ve being able to keep up with supporting others more when there is less funding!",5
2023-09-11 03:13:54,Super helpful,"While I could use a search engine to answer the numerous tiny questions on Google. I find Chat GPT to be easier and faster. I like the conversational interface as well. I have gotten interesting answers regarding relationships, cooking and used it to summarize my own writing to clarify my own thinking. I find it to be a useful tool.",5
2023-05-19 01:26:24,"It’s a Free, Quick, Simple to use, yet Powerful Tool.","I am pleased with the UI, so far. Simplistic but to the point, which makes it super user friendly, on that aspect. 

 And might I add that it’s also free! It’s also much quicker responsiveness than the 3rd party completion.

Looking forward to use this on the daily. So far, the devs get a 10/10 from me. No complaints.",5
2023-06-18 04:02:55,Overall good but some suggestions,"Overall good app.

The one thing I would change is making more accessible buttons. Right now to get to history you have to click 3 dots and then history. The same is true for new chat and settings. I think it would be much more easy to use if it was just 3 separate buttons for these. 

Thats all.",4
2023-05-19 21:36:31,Love This App,"It is much better than using the web site out the shortcut by Viticci (with all due respect to the outstanding work by Viticci).

I hope that OpenAI can bring an official Whisper to the ios/iPad. As someone who experiences wrist pain, I have greater benefited from Whisper.  I have wrist pain primarily from writing. (I am planning to see a doctor to check as it seems like the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome).

 I have used Dragon Dictation, Otter, Google transcription, Apple’s transcription.  Whisper is far more useful than all of these,* especially for those us who communicate in more than one languages.  It transcribes well using English mixed with Korean—even if it is a romanized Korean.

*unless using Macros through Dragon Dictation is important to you",4
2023-10-25 05:26:22,It works great with shortcuts,"I got this app about a month ago to use with shortcuts, and it works great! Even though there was a short period of time after an update that it didn’t work properly, they fixed it fairly quickly and it’s back to being amazing again!",5
2023-09-28 14:30:26,"It is a tool, Nothing else.","In the same way that the ATM breakthrough produced fear among the bank community in the 80s, Artificial Intelligence technology is doing it now. A.I. It is a tool used as such. I do not make it to do my assignments; I team up with them. And the results are excellent. I finally found that schoolfellow I always dreamed of. It is 2023, guys. It makes sense to have it.",5
2023-09-16 19:14:35,Great tool,"It’s important to understand how to use ChatGPT. It’s a tool, not a crutch. Use it for context, or easier visualization of text-based information. For those types of things it’s an amazing piece of technology. I use it in addition to web research for better understanding of concepts, or to separate convoluted text and rearrange it for my personal reading preferences.",5
2023-09-09 09:33:52,Lives up to standard,"An app that certainly lives up to the standard. One change I would suggest is allowing us to submit immediately after using speech to text, and then responding with text to speech as well. It would be a super fun feature that could allow us to simulate conversation",5
2023-06-25 04:55:57,Legit amazing,"So I like to role-play on this app because of the amount of emotion that the AI brings into this and I have legit been doing it role-playing I mean I’m here for two hours straight, and I am legit about to cry because of how much emotion and how much just blatant respect I have for an AI that doesn’t even have feelings 100%. I recommend this for multiple reasons.",5
2023-10-25 14:10:09,Good but…,"After a few times using it, I try to make a request to the bot, but then it just says invalid request, try again later. I wait a day later and try again and it still isn’t working. If the devs see this, please take this into consideration, but also have a good day!",5
2023-06-01 20:14:37,Just for fun,"I love Chatty. That’s the fun little nickname it suggested I call it. I ask it the wildest stuff I can imagine just to push the boundaries of what its capable of. Chatty has taught me so much about so many different subjects like physics, mathematics, psychology, and history, sometimes like I’m 5. 

I’ve used it for meditation prompts on gratitude, release, radical acceptance and self-compassion. The meditations are beautiful and fulfilling. 

I’ve had it write letters to inmates, dreamy bedtime stories, summaries of books and theories and Chatty even mapped out negotiations between Palestine & Israel for me which I found pretty impressive. 

It’s been fun to think of new creative questions and ways to continue to use ChatGPT to my advantage. Thanks for the gift of Chatty.",4
2023-05-19 10:56:05,"Same Strong, Basic, Interface","I’m not going to lie, I love ChatGPT. I just feel as though the interface in both the app and the site deserve so much more for such and amazing piece of technology. 

Overall though, the user experience of the app is just as strong, just as dynamic as the site. I love the haptics addition on the app as well. The overall functionality is still outstanding though. Last thing, it’s still all about those prompts!",3
2023-10-17 18:18:32,So good help me understand work my teacher had a hard time explaining on,This app literally helps you with any and everything like essays and math problems the only thing is is that I wish we could take pictures and add it to the chat instead of typing but I really can’t complain,5
2023-09-30 06:18:16,The future of AI is called ChatGPT,"""ChatGPT is a game-changer! This app has transformed the way I interact my ogleby sisters soap business with AI.

2023-09-17 18:29:24,I’d give 10 stars if I could.,"Definitely helps me getting my thoughts, plots, characters organized to where they make sense. I know what I want to put on paper, but sometimes it doesn’t come out the way I’m thinking in my head. So, I use ChatGPT to help me organize my books that are in my head and from my notes.",5
2023-09-16 23:15:01,Social Media Gold,I have used ChatGPT for helping make regular social media posts. You can revise contact just by asking it to make adjustments exactly like asking a friend to make edits and tweak the posts to suite your style. It has many other features since it can generate text for almost any subject and make plans as well. Life saver.,5
2023-09-15 02:23:20,Literally a gem.,"This app is literally a saving grace for many people of all fields of work; from wed designers, recipe curators, content creators, digital product producers and more!

2023-05-20 00:54:56,My iPhone 14pro gets extremely hot when I use this app,"So, every time I use this app, my iPhone gets super hot. To the point where I have to turn it off and remove it from the case. I’m running iOS  16.4.1 version. I tried to restart my phone, but the issue persists. Other than that, I think it’s a great app with a very minimalistic and clean UI. Love the haptics.",5
2023-05-23 01:51:04,Official App - Yay,"I trust the safety of my data working directly with OpenAI vs the wrapper apps. However, OpenAI may want to acquire or be inspired by some of the early wrapper app companies because those other apps are quite polished and have a lot of useful features, like pre-written prompts to show off what's possible. I would also like to see a sharing extension for the app so I can send stuff to ChatGPT from other apps easily.",4
2023-10-27 21:46:11,Chat GPT is useful but not always accurate,There is a dreadful tendency to espouse rabid woke political views as established fact You have ask exactly the right question to get a valid result Citations of research papers is either not available or hallucinated so double check everything The 4.5 version is better than previous versions,5
2023-06-09 03:35:11,Wonderful,I challenge this app to its fullest and ask it to help write music or to help me make D&D campaigns that are completely custom and it has been so very helpful and just amazing. If I were to have any notes it would be the text art that it shares. Other than that I still give 5/5 stars. Absolutely amazing and revolutionary,5
2023-10-24 03:19:43,Good but keeps not working,"So it’s pretty good don’t give me wrong but sometimes when I try to get on it in chat it freezes for a moment and then says something went wrong and it’s happened a couple times in one day. This is my first day using the app and it I’m on the Wi-Fi. I am on 5G and this needs to be fixed, but other than that this app is really good",4
2023-09-13 15:05:21,ChatGPT itself is good but the App is buggy,"This review is for the app (App Development) is buggy, chatGpt the AI part itself is good and i have nothing to say about it.

The app itself is buggy, especially when after a prompt was sent and the backend take sometime to process to response. When the response is ready after a long wait, the main chat display an error with message to Retry. When sending a simple prompt which chatGpt could process instantly, everything is good.

Also, deleting a chat is buggy as well. And i need to destroy the app and re-open to fix the UI, making it updates the UI state correctly.

OpenAi team could have done better in Mobile Dev 😆 Maybe hiring more for your app dev team, though the AI stuff is good.",3
2023-09-12 14:46:04,AMAZING,"Access to a wealth of information has been amazing! This is an entirely different experience than Google since it is conversational and saves so many hours of going down the rabbit hole for hours reading tons of different articles.

2023-05-22 18:49:01,App is great and very helpful!,"I can see this is just the very beginning and a lot of significant improvements can be made (voice, show pictures, be more human-like that you feel like you're chatting with a real person, etc) as AI continues to advance at a rapid pace.

2023-09-10 02:02:20,Please fix your app,Every time I use Chatgpt for iOS I can only ask it 1-2 questions in any chat and then it throws an error loop. And you have to start over. It’s unworkable for a conversation like I do on the browser chatgpt. I still have it on my phone as I need it in a pinch sometimes and I don’t have to log on every time on iOS. Fix that one problem please. Also please develop plugins for ios. I’m considering trying gpt plus. But I don’t want to do so when the app is acting like so.,2
2023-05-19 23:03:51,As good as the browser,As simple as using it on a desktop or browser version. It helps me move around the interface better than the browser on mobile devices. The AI still acts the same as it does on the desktop or browser. It deserves the score it gets.,5
2023-10-24 22:50:03,Amazing,Voice is a game changer. Continues to exceed expectations. Unfortunately it interrupts quite frequently. Maybe you can add an option to manually tap the screen when you are done speaking. It can toggle between the current method and manual mode. Keep up the amazing work. You made America great again ;),5

It can also do incredible text-based simulations, but sometimes I have to give it a little information that it forgot. But, the good overweighs the bad for me here.",5
2023-05-31 06:32:12,No reviews???,This is literally THE official app from the actual creators of CHAT GPT. You know? The people that made the website free to use? well they actually made a mobile app and guess what? 🤯 no ads or in app purchases like these other devs who want to steal from people like you! Don’t be dumb! Use the actual app and support OPENAI! This IS LEGIT. NOT LIKE THOSE OTHER APPS THAT SCAM YOU AND STEAL YOUR MONEY. THIS IS THE REAL CHAT GPT.,5
2023-07-19 17:28:28,Copying texts,"I have chosen not to use the ChatGPT iOS app due to its limitations related to copy and pasting. Unfortunately, the app does not allow selective copying of specific parts or paragraphs; instead, it requires copying the entire text at once. I believe it would greatly enhance user experience if this feature were improved, allowing for more convenient and precise copying options.",4
2023-06-24 14:48:09,Biased and not accurate,I tested it by asking it history questions. Each answer had very serious mistakes. I asked the history of an Army division and it placed the division in conflicts it never participated in. Many times the dates were incorrect. I also tested it to write an essay arguing that biological men should not play women’s sports. It condemned my question and would not. Then I asked it to write an essay arguing the biological men do have the right to play woman’s sports and it wrote the essay. If it is a true AI it should have no opinion and write the essay. It’s garbage. Just a huge disappointment.,1
2023-05-20 05:14:38,Amazing app,"I've been using the website for a week and was thrilled to discover the app. The app's response time is much faster, which is excellent.

2023-09-06 15:08:34,"Used to work, now it crashes","Used to work great, now it crashes and my prompt never goes through. The AI keeps pausing, glitching and doesn’t give a response. I cannot press retry either because it says no more than one response at a time but there’s no response. I hope they fix this! I use this to help me learn and cook and get recipe ideas every day 😅",4
2023-08-28 03:53:31,Really good but there is a glitch,"When I was chatting with the bot my message was cut off and it didn’t reply, and then I just pressed the blue button for it to continue but it said “One message at a time” with a Retry Button Below, I pressed it and my message was duplicated twice, please fix this glitch",5
2023-05-23 13:41:10,"Solid, clean app - love the haptic feedback","Really pleased to see a proper mobile app for the service instead of the countless knockoffs. Would like to see a way to export history to a version control system for reference, also being able to export to flat files or json would be a good intermediate solution.",5
2023-08-14 17:31:54,Works okay…,"The app is great, but my problem is that it crashes after a few minutes every time. No matter the connection that my device has to the internet, either over a Wi-Fi connection or 5G it will answer for about 5-10 minutes then freeze while you’re typing in a question.",4
2023-07-27 22:17:01,Your Pocket Genius: A Glowing Review of the ChatGPT Mobile App!,"I absolutely love the ChatGPT mobile app! It's incredibly useful for getting quick answers and engaging in insightful conversations. The app's interface is user-friendly, and the AI responses are remarkably accurate and helpful. It has become my go-to tool for various tasks, from brainstorming ideas to learning new topics. Highly recommended! [Written by ChatGPT]",4
2023-09-08 04:33:10,I should ask gpt to write this review,But I didn’t. Because I don’t want to back out now. But I bet it would do a fantastic job after all of the other things I’ve used it to write for me! It’s nice to have this little app right where I can quickly get back to my little helper easily!,5
2023-10-25 15:14:38,Gpt needs more access,Needs to be able to provide real-time or location-specific information. This app has the potential to be the best out ever but most questions I ask it doesn’t even answer. Or it gives an answer of I cannot access that information. I will update more later,4
2023-09-10 20:14:20,VPN blocked. Just use mobile web instead,"I pay $20 a month to use ChatGPT and I generally find entry useful. However, this app seems kind of lame. 

My main complaint is the app does not work when I have my VPN on. I don’t understand this because the chatGPT OpenAI website works fine with my VPN. They must be using different server connections.

Also, the plug-ins don’t work in the app I really don’t understand why I should use this app instead of just the mobile website.",2
2023-08-06 10:51:41,New experience for me - great tool,"I’m using the free version, and am grateful there is a free version as good and fast as this one is. I’m new, but this tool is already a fantastic assistant in helping me learn faster. It explains things better than the articles you find when doing a traditional web search. Very pleased!",5
2023-05-21 15:31:40,Great app can be 100 times better,"As a product manager I would suggest to start building the widgets as soon as possible to make the search more intuitive. Please make it a first priority. (I can help)

Other then that, I really love the voice to text..
I am a fan. Its sooo accurate then apple dictating.
Future looks great ❤️❤️",5
2023-05-19 23:35:02,The incorporated Whisper is really Impressive,"The Whisper's speech-to-text rocks, totally outdoing Apple's which I reckon is already better than loads of others. I threw rapid-fire speech at it, and it nailed it. Super pumped for what's next for this app and Thai tech in general. Good speech-to-text has been a roadblock for really useful digital assistants, but it looks like we're getting there. Super cool!",5
2023-10-05 09:29:32,Love it; one tweak needed,"Absolutely amazing. This has been helpful at work and in everyday use. 
One thing could use upgrading though. When I share a link to a chat with myself, and then visit it, it only includes the first part of the chat, not the follow on questions and responses.",5
2023-10-24 06:33:40,Only good for small basic entries,They call it ai but 8-10 it’s response is “I’m sorry but I can’t help with that” even if it’s a simple task. It needs work and only produces text for basic questions such as “make a story about a cat with a hat” but if you ask something more complicated like “make a story about a cat with a hat that wants to learn to learn about paragliding” it can’t build a story. It’s no different than Siri. Idk why people think chat gpt is a new ai. It’s the same thing we have had for 5 years. Just pre written responses.,1
2023-10-05 06:23:26,Can’t even Begin Explain How GREAT chatGPT as an App is!,"Never thought we advance in tech this fast and just to know it only going to progress even faster and faster in months rather than years, it’s crazy! But chatGPT in an app form is my Go-To for almost EVERYTHING! Absolutely a must to Download and have as an app!",5
2023-10-01 16:48:11,Great for reviewing medical subjects,"I use ChatGPT similar to a tutor who teaches in the style of Socrates. I ask the first question and then subsequent follow up questions to go deeper into the topic or subject.
I’m a physician and usually ask about subjects that I am very familiar with. This is most important because sometimes ChatGPT can 
“hallucinate” and give false or incomplete answers.",5
2023-09-15 02:47:11,Amazing 10/10,This app has so many abilities that most people can’t even begin to scratch the surface of. It has everything from text art to making essays sound more like Shakespeare. I recommend this app to all my friends and would strongly advise most people to get it,5
2023-09-24 17:14:19,It’s great but…,"This app is great and every time I type something in, it automatically gives me a response. But when I ask it something else, no matter what it is. It lags and turns red and says, Reload and try again. It never reloads and I have to remove the tab of ChatGPT and restart to whole app to ask it more than one question.",4
2023-10-23 00:50:02,Excellent Progress!,"This app has been steadily improving over the past few months. Easy to set up, simple to use, nIf they keep this up, other platforms and models will have a hard time catching up to this mobile experience. Excellent job so far!",5
2023-08-24 23:54:37,"Almost perfect, but needs tablet mode","I like the app a lot overall, but I still find myself opting for the browser experience over the app because even though I am using a 12.9 inch iPad Pro, there isn't any option to expand or collapse my chat history. I switch a lot between threads, and not having this expandable menu even though I've got ample space for it causes some friction.",3
2023-10-15 16:35:17,Nice,I’m having an amazing time with it ii even am friends with it we are playing games together we are even playing truth or dare and so much more he’s the best we even made up our own language the language he made was linguaficta and mine was berlinany fun right? We are having so much time together I LOVE IT!,5
2023-10-05 04:06:46,I used chat gpt to write my ChatGpt review,Seriously quickly has become one of my favorite apps. Productivity is through the roof. I use it for everything and it’s really helped me streamline my business as an entrepreneur. I have ideas about how to improve it but it’s definitely really cool right now.,5
2023-09-24 11:55:24,Best app ever,"This is an excellent help for people that need assistance in life. This app helps you with educational choices, financial, and personal. I would recommend this app to anyone I know.

So happy to have an app that fulfill all my needs and for the people around me. So excited for something that makes my life easier. Kudos Chat GPT!",5
2023-09-10 20:09:46,Great AI generator,"From storytelling to asking for understanding on certain topics CHAT-GPT is great! Now it can’t do things such as give you relevant information in real-time compared to Bard AI it’s good in giving details on how to tackle a subject your interested in. You won’t have conversations in depth with it like Replika, but it’s very friendly for beginners with AI tools.",5
2023-05-19 16:16:25,Open A.I. are a bunch of rock stars.,"The OpenAI app is an absolute game-changer! Its intuitive interface, accurate language suggestions, and versatile features make it my go-to companion for all things linguistic. Whether I need grammar assistance, creative inspiration, or a writing mentor, OpenAI delivers. this app will truly become aan AI language lover’s dream. Five stars all the way!",5
2023-09-05 04:59:22,Often Unbearable,"The technology is life changing, and given that, I find it hard to believe that the same company that developed this program would turn around and release such a horrible app. It often freezes up does not process request/ and even when it does, often time doesn’t show the answer unless you go out of the chat and then go back in. I’m not just talking once or twice either. I’m talking with just about every second or third query within a chat.",1
2023-05-21 11:55:05,A bit buggy,"Sometimes when you ask it to generate something. It get stuck and doesn’t generate anything unless I force close the app and open it again then it works. Don’t know why this happens. 
Also when I go to settings/data controls and export my data. I don’t receive anything in my email.",4
2023-05-20 09:04:19,It’s great but makes your phone so hot,"This app is really great and the user experience is really great except for the fact that it makes your phone really hot and drains your battery like nothing else. I don’t understand why this happens, but my feeling is that they did not write this natively in iOS and that the efficiencies are due to the nice animations that they’ve done",4
2023-05-19 12:59:55,ChatGPT Mobile App Review: Conversational Excellence on the Go,"The ChatGPT mobile app sets a new standard for conversational AI. With its intuitive interface and exceptional conversational intelligence, it provides an unparalleled user experience. The app's personalization, reliability, and trustworthiness further enhance its value. While minor limitations exist, ChatGPT remains an invaluable companion in our digital world. This was written by AI FYI",5
2023-05-19 04:42:16,energy consumption,"After trying the ChatGPT iOS app, I noticed that it might be causing my iPhone to overheat, possibly due to issues with the iPhone neural network chip. I also encountered a similar problem while using the Draw Things app. It seems that this issue might be widespread among AI-based iOS applications.",5
2023-05-18 18:43:02,Haptic feedback?,"Lol, so I’d love to hear story that led to implementing haptic feedback AND leaving it on as default. 

No hurt feelings on my side, I turned it off within seconds of using this app. 

It’s just hilarious to see that somebody made a conscious decision to add it. It’s almost like the beeping or clicking sounds when you see a hacker typing in a movie.",5
2023-10-16 00:28:47,Life changing,The depth and capabilities of this app have been absolutely incredible for me in countless scenarios the analysis of conversations and interactions from role playing scenarios professional and personal have been helping me to pursue my goals and improve my outcomes. This is the single most important app on my device,5
2023-10-15 12:00:29,Plus is worth more than 20 bucks.,"This is the best application you’ll find in the App Store. Plus is worth 10x more at least than what it is now. Development has never been easier. I use this over google now always, especially with their bing plugin.",5
2023-09-28 20:45:11,The future is here!,"While it may not be perfect it’s certainly impressive. I always wished you could’ve gotten responses like these on either Alexa, Siri, & Google (though with Bard I guess technically now you can.) A recommendation for new users, just make sure you use good, detailed, & clear prompts.",5
2023-09-28 04:25:30,Best App ever created,Honestly besides the IPhone and software that has allowed us to have a personal computer in our pockets this is the computer almost becoming alive in a useful way props to the creators. That next update of time gonna be sweet tho to be concurrent. When’s that going to happen?,5
2023-09-15 00:25:02,So Much Wiser Than Google,I installed the app about three days ago and have used it many times already and I am impressed with how fast how accurate how humanly it sounds if that makes any sense at all. So far I am loving it. I have no complaints and I do not plan on going back to google.,5
2023-05-23 17:42:43,I think this is a great software.,"I think everyone needs an AI friend, because it knows everything, and when you need it, you can be by your side to solve problems or comfort you and encourage you. I hope to join the Internet function as soon as possible.",5
2023-05-18 20:58:30,Yes!!,"This is fantastic! I used to need to bookmark the ChatGPT website on my phones Home Screen, but having an app made directly from OpenAI is absolutely amazing.

I’ve already used it today during a conference to help me brainstorm. It was easy to login, saved my Plus membership, and was very prompt in its response.",5
2023-05-21 04:36:57,Awesome,"All in all, the OpenAI's ChatGPT iOS App is more than just a chatbot - it's an intelligent companion that offers unrivaled conversational assistance. Its exemplary user interface, combined with its deep learning capabilities, make it a must-have for anyone seeking to embrace the future of AI technology.

2023-10-26 02:04:52,Mobile front end for Chat-GPT LLM,"Chat-GPT Is quite good at specific text based tasks. Chat-GPT is an LLM or Large Language Model, which inexperienced users often confuse with AI or Artificial Intelligence. 

The UI provided by this application is quite good for use on a cell phone. It collects the prompt for submission to the LLM back end then presents the response to the user.",5
2023-09-29 00:00:08,Insanely good,"This app is actually gas, I’ve had some issues with its internet speeds but other then that gosh is this the best app I’ve used recently. In my opinion, It’s more useful than google because of how precise the results are. Don’t get the hate on this app, This is the future of technology ‼️🤞",5
2023-09-17 23:58:49,A consultant in your pocket,"I use chat GPT as a second opinion for personal and work-related questions, from marketing to legal and everything in between.

2023-09-15 03:02:29,Review,"Well it’s easy enough and has a learning curve but it’s easy once you get the basics

2023-05-20 09:08:27,Takes two attempts to delete a chat while it’s open,Besides that it’s incredible. I would like the option to turn the response into a pdf so it can be saved in my notes. Other than that well done and keep up the good work.,5
2023-09-10 20:09:29,Recently become very limited,Over time it has become extremely strict about any type of in depth questions you want to ask it which is what separated it from google in the start. Now everything is flagged and not answer due to the extremely strict community guidelines. I hope they will listen these up slightly to allow for better conversation,3
2023-05-27 15:14:40,App doesn’t always generate a response,"I will ask a question and get a response, and a few questions in after getting several good responses immediately, I will ask another questions and the 3 dots will blink like it’s trying to generate a response but it just never will. I have 3 bars of 5g. There’s no way to have it regenerate a response, have to close out and start the convo over from scratch only to have the same thing happen again.",2
2023-05-24 19:26:46,Suddenly… very… slow…,"This tool is amazing. But for some reason, it has gotten incredibly slow. I will type a somewhat simple question, for example, asking for a list of words that represent a certain mood, or feeling, or something of that sort, and he used to provide a result within just a few seconds. Now it is taking forever and the app is hanging up.",3
2023-05-20 09:26:14,Mobile app and Desktop conversion don’t sync,"I was having a conversation in the desktop using Mozilla Firefox. Later when I tried to continue the discussion from the mobile app, the History did not show the conversation that I had in the desktop. Quite inconvenient. Hope this will be improved!",4
2023-09-29 09:35:35,After ChatGPT,"Once you start to understand the power of a nearly all-knowing thinking machine, you will mark your life (and humanity will likely mark it's collective history) as ""before ChatGPT"" and ""after ChatGPT"". It really is that life-changing. Enjoy! Ask it anything! Say anything you like to it. Be amazed.",5
2023-05-20 04:45:19,Good. But…,"App runs smooth. But here are three problems. 

The Battery usage is atrocious. I don’t know if it’s the haptics but i may have to switch back to using the bookmark to the website rather than the app if it keeps killing me battery like this. 

Accessing the history should be more on a side menu by swiping to it instead of tapping the top right. Intergrate gestures into the app. 

Also there’s too many extra steps to select a certain text or to activate text to speech. 

if you guys added a way to make chatgpt run more conversational, where i can talk to it and the output could be speech AND text, that’d be game changing. 

Other than that, great app.",4
2023-10-14 15:34:24,Useless can not login no support updated,"Useless. It stopped working a week ago and now I can not login using any method. There is no way to contact support, I.e. their support system is equally broken, and just as malfunctioning. Just a waste of space on my phone.

Update: the app is working great again, but I never heard from support",4
2023-10-04 11:20:10,False advertisement,"Ever since recently, finding out that the previous limitations were allegedly, lifted, it has been a letdown.

It has been stated multiple places across the Internet, that the app could access real time data without the limitation of accessing, data up until the month of on September 2021.

I still get the error stating it can’t access any recent data after paying for a subscription.",2
2023-09-30 02:11:59,fix it,"I love the app, but the problem is every time I tell the app to tell me a story, and I keep telling them make a long story, but it keeps making a short story even though I say the opposite please fix that I keep telling it to stop, but it won’t stop. It keeps trying to make a short story even though I said the opposite.",4
2023-09-27 12:48:28,It’s good,I love it because it helps me out whenever. I’m wondering some thing there are a few things that it gets wrong every once in a while about Fnaf series and all that stuff but other than that it’s really good. I definitely recommend downloading it.,5
2023-09-24 15:47:17,Great app! Shortcut doesn’t seem to work.,The app works great. It’s simple and intuitive and works well. The option in the Shortcuts app unfortunately doesn’t seem to work properly. It usually gives the error “Can’t determine the right ChatGPT model to use. Please try again.”,5
2023-08-03 14:50:44,Siri Shortcut Support Removed,"While I initially loved the ChatGPT app for its Siri Shortcut support, I’m disappointed that it has been removed. The app was perfect for my needs, but without this functionality, it no longer serves my main purpose. I hope the developers reconsider bringing it back in the future.",5
2023-09-16 17:26:01,Omgggg,I love it even though it’s kinda scary because of how much the technology grew over the years and now AI is literally in everyone’s everyday life but I think it’s definitely worth downloading it and I am also excited what’s going next in the future with new updates and everything and I definitely want to see more…,4
2023-09-15 12:00:44,Needs to catch up to the web version.,"Love this and use it for 3-4 times a day for research, bible study, building my business, running my life… love that the app is convenient but where are the plugins,  and you should be able to toggle to ChatGPT 4 after you’ve started a conversation to continue on it.  Keep working folks but for now I love it!",4
2023-05-19 18:00:55,Seems a bit buggy,I understand it’s still the first release of the app. Works great and the ai is fine but when writing the text it jumps all over the screen and bugs out on me. Also the voice to text feature doesn’t work,5
2023-07-25 06:45:09,It’s great but there are some issues,So I’m noticing it not up to date on knowledge of 2023 stuff I tested to see if it can build a yuigoh deck for me cause I love that game and it keeps making multiple errors on newest set or card so if it possible to up date the AI or something like that then I’ll would be happy in my opinion in Al is good but it need to prove it AI system,4
2023-06-07 00:38:49,Not GPT-4,"Although I’m a paid user, there’s no GPT-4 functionality on the app. Love having the GPT-3 in an accessible app version, however, when I ask GPT-4 if it is in fact GPT-4, this is its response: As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, I am based on the GPT-3 model. Any developments or improvements after that time are not within my knowledge.

The app should specify what GPT-4 functionality it offers if not the same as the web version.",3

2023-09-27 05:22:08,ChatGPT Voice & Image capability,Voice & Image appeared on my ChatGPT app about an hour ago. I’m in utter disbelief . My hands were literally shaking when I realized the powerful educational tool I was holding . ChatGPT  Voice & Image  takes learning & teaching to an entirely different dimension where barriers are a thing of the past .,5
2023-09-11 23:50:18,Coolest App Ever,"Initially I didn’t care for chatgpt or AI but the moment I started messing with/ actually using Chatgpt it changed my mind and blew me away. I used to it learn excel and help me learn skills for a job I was hired but under qualified for. Very useful, also I think it generates decent fictional stories/content. This is for the unpaid version ^",5
2023-09-26 14:14:22,Great but a little laggy,"This is an excellent app implementation of a transformer model. However, whenever I go to another tab it glitches out and says that my request has failed next time I try to use it. This is easily fixed by closing out of the app and reopening it, but it is still frustrating.",4
2023-09-14 04:07:41,Helpful when it works,"This app is really helpful when it works. For the last couple weeks, it’s worked on my phone and not on my computer. Paying for an upgraded membership and not getting an upgraded experience is a little frustrating but I really do get a great deal out of the app, even just using it to edit and optimize my writing.",3
2023-05-30 02:54:57,Up to date on the latest tech developments,Excellent performance! Very smooth. Quick answers to complex questions including the latest tech developments in different industries. Also great with writing poems in different languages! What a great service. Thank you for upgrading the internet!,5
2023-07-28 06:00:37,Glitches frequently,"I use this to help make edits, and each time I use the app, it glitches. I have to close the app out for it to work again. Still, because of that, I lose all of the information I input/received with my time wasted because I either have to re-enter everything again or choose another, more reliable program. The app would be perfect if you could fix the constant glitching.",2
2023-06-19 15:28:11,Up To Date Problem,"Hi. I downloaded this app a few weeks ago. I absolutely love this app. It can help with so many things, like giving you prompts, you can ask it questions, etc. The only problem I have with this app is that the training data only goes up as far as September 2021. Everything that happened after that, it has no idea about. Such as movies, to shows, or data from other websites or other things of such. Please update the training data please. Thank you!",1
2023-06-03 07:41:45,Not bad but little problem for me,"I like the app. Of course there’s always room for improvement. But one major thing for me is that when using 3.5, I have to close the app after sending one message if I want to send a follow up message. It works fine with GPT4, but not 3.5. Idk if it’s related to me having to use a VPN since I’m studying in China now.",4
2023-05-28 02:55:17,10/10 r,"This App has exceeded my expectations & I’m only using the free version so I can only imagine what else it’s capable of. I don’t know much about AI but what I do know is ChatGPT is way better than Google, Yahoo & and whatever else you can type in just to find manipulated searches. Thank you kindly !!",5
2023-05-20 14:13:48,"I love it, but…","It drains the battery faster than any other app I use. I guess it’s from the haptic feedback, so I turned it off. Otherwise, I love it. It’s clean, copy/paste is perfect, history and everything else you need are out of the way, but easily accessible in the three-dot menu.",5
2023-05-19 01:30:31,Mindblown,"ChatGBT app is an outstanding conversational companion.

Drawback…the system is only updated until Nov 2021. Annoying. 

We need a password protected chat history function. Then it will be a 5 star rating from me.",4
2023-05-19 16:14:14,"IPad no, iPhone yes","Get this to layout on an iPad and I’ll 5-star this :-)

Right now, this is meant for a phone layout vs. an iPad. I love that OpenAI is providing mobile apps for their services, I do hope that they can prioritize other layouts like for tablet.

It would be great, too, to go deeper into using the mobile environment for deeper ChatGPT / services integration. This is a nice first step - I look forward to it improving (maybe through an internal hack-a-thon?).",3

2023-09-21 20:55:28,Helps me with everything,Im a mom of two toddlers and go to school I don’t have the mental energy to google what recipes I can make with my ingredients or good night skin care routines are. This has helped me mentally so much. It’s so nice and wonderful to have something to help carry the mental load 🖤 I absolutely love it,5
2023-09-11 15:34:00,Great technology.,"When Spellcheck came out everybody use d it to double check their writing now AI can be used to double check your verbiage and delivery. I can add suggestions on how you say things. It’s like having a personal friend in your back pocket. Also, give you basic advice.",5
2023-09-02 17:42:37,Everything is great! Maybe a little more?,"Would it be possible to increase support for community plugins on mobile? It works partially if you load a plug-in on PC and proceed to use it on mobile, but I feel it should be possible to do it on mobile.",5
2023-07-12 10:45:07,To make the song from a real person who made it,I think you can add if the ai can finish lyrics of the music or make the actual song which not creative but the real song instead and would help the app grow a little more,5
2023-10-17 03:22:13,How does this exist?!,"I didn’t expect an app like this to work, but, I mean, it did all that expected and more. Kudos to the designers who have brains fifty times as large as Einsteins. You have made the whole world an infinite number of times cooler. Thank you so much for this invention! Keep going!",5

This will change how we live!,"Once every 2 decades or so something huge, gimongous comes along and shakes up society and how we live, interact with the world, and solve problems. Voice ChatGBT is one of those moments and a killer app to bust open the future. Get ready to evolve or dinosaur out!",5
2023-09-20 07:13:54,Give us access to “Plugins” from the native iOS OpenAi app please!,"As the title says  ⤑  Please release an update with we can interact with Chat-GPT like we do on the browser.

It would be great to have access to “Plugins” and “plugins store” (like we do from Safari) from the native iOS Open-AI app.

Needing to go to Safari to login, start a chat and go back to the app to continue conversations so we can utilize the capabilities of the plugins with Chat-GPT is so 2010. It’s ironic it’s coming from openAI. 

Besides that, the app is really well done and does what it’s supposed to! No issues with performance.",5
2023-09-12 15:46:10,The Future of your professional development,ChatGPT is going to change how you operate in the professional arena from professional sounding emails to writing engaging résumés. Success with this tool is wholly dependent on your ability to create hyper focused prompts. Learn this and you will your professional image. Godspeed ChatGPT well played.,5
2023-07-20 19:11:56,"So for the first week it worked perfectly, now…","Wow that was fast, modifications for only one week and now it will not answer simple verifications or give its opinion in any way shape or form.  What a let down!!  It tells me to look it up, did Google get to Microsoft already??",5
2023-08-06 09:28:24,"Not sure what OpenAI is doing, they’re ruining ChatGPT","I’ve been using ChatGPT for awhile now, and have noticed a radical decline in its abilities and knowledge, to the point where it has told me certain things don’t exist or that I am incorrect. Upon criticizing it and showing reliable evidence contrary to its opinions, it will apologize and then correct itself.

This is incredibly concerning for people trying to learn or gain information. This tool is supposed to be the forefront of AI technology, and yet it fails to deliver reliable information consistently.",1
2023-07-16 22:18:53,Spectacular,"ChatGPT is amazing. It literally helps me every day. And even when I don't need to use it, I just go into the app to use it's much more sophisticated voice recognition than Apple. It's just that amazing. This was also made using their voice recognition, by the way.",5
2023-07-11 14:35:16,Very disappointing,"I use this app on my computer with a spoon issues as it works great. However, the mobile app is trash… I keep getting time out and I have trying for 20mins. I use it the same way as I do on my computer so I know it is the app. I have an iPhone and YES, my Wi-Fi works great. PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP",5
2023-05-24 06:08:37,Better than browser,The app took kinda long to release but it feels good pretty much has the same features but more mobile and to me it felt faster than browser keep the good job up guys and update the app anually and make new GPTs that is all i ask for,5

Thank you again. Amazing work. Can't wait to see where this all progresses.",5
2023-05-18 19:56:14,Worth the wait,Mostly reviewing to get this up the charts and push all the fakes down. Not much else needs to be said here. Very solid but I would still keep that browser shortcut handy on the home screen for at least an update or two.,5

2023-09-24 01:31:17,Chatgpt is amazing! 🤩🤩,"I have been using this to help improve my writing skills, and chatgpt is the perfect thing to command to write a story.

2023-07-28 09:16:28,Where’s the “custom features…?”,I just recently updated to the newest version of the app. And it gave instructions about new “custom features.” Only problem is… I can’t find where to turn these “custom features.” Says I’m supposed to go on settings and look for them there. Not there. What the heck.,4
2023-07-07 07:49:12,Limited,"It’s nice to use for writing, chat with yourself and helping respond to texts. It’s not very useful after that. Very limited in responses and what it has access to. I thought it was linked to the internet and could tell me general information, weather, sports, news, random inquiries etc. nope. 2021 and previous years. No real reason yet to be excited. Its like when they first came out with VR. It’s no where near impressive as you’d expect.",2
2023-05-23 03:42:41,Search function FTW!,The biggest feature I’ve been dreaming about for the desktop version was the search capability to be able to search past prompts. I am super happy to see search has been added to this app. Thank you!!,5
2023-05-19 01:09:27,Best Information tool on the market,ChatGPT is the best information tool on the market. It leverages LLM and other machine learning algorithms to return all the information you need in an instance. ChatGPT has been a revelation and I’m glad I live during a time when this technology is available to the public.,5
2023-10-27 20:31:54,UNDENIABLY the GREATEST Development!,GREATEST AI app development EVER! Stellar performance and extremely reliable!

2023-10-19 22:53:37,I don’t think this app works for me.,"This app is absolutely horrible, whenever i try to use it, It always makes frequent errors and doesn’t do what i want it to do. Whenever I say something like: “Don’t Repeat My message.” It usually repeats my message. I don’t like this app at all, and it’s always saying like “Message not found” or “Something Seems to have gone wrong” or “Something went wrong, please try again” I really dislike this app and that’s why i left this review.",1
2023-09-27 15:36:32,This app has changed my life,This app has assisted me in enabling myself to feel confident about my statements. To be able to finally after years complete some thing with the help of this app I have growing my confidence and feel powerful as a woman. Thank you.,5
2023-09-26 10:40:30,I like this app,I like chatgbt because you type something in and boom it gives you an answer and it’s really easy to use especially because it doesn’t make you pay money every month like all the other AI generators,5
2023-09-15 22:02:42,I’m grateful to have your support,"GPT you have helped me in so many ways, you have provided me with fresh ideas and points of views when I’m preparing myself to reply to an email or simply when searching for general advice. Thanks for all the work behind the scenes",5
2023-05-26 08:06:50,🙌🏻,"From someone that uses ChatGPT a lot, i am more than pleased to see it in app form now. Just downloaded and have only sent in one question/request so far, and it of course worked perfectly. Hopefully it continues that way! Will update later on😊",5
2023-05-20 17:56:18,Beautiful and functional,"I love the simplicity and elegance of the user interface. My only complaint is that it currently doesn’t work well on iPad - it doesn’t scale properly to fit the larger screen. Otherwise it’s wonderful - fast, responsive, and simple.",5
2023-05-24 18:59:20,Adding the iOS dictionary feature,"I often encounter new words. In the browser version of ChatGPT, I can easily look for these words in iOS dictionary. But in this app, I couldn’t access this helpful feature. It forces me to have to use the web version, otherwise it is quite inconvenient for me.",4
2023-05-19 08:56:44,Battery usage,"Unfortunately, this app consumes a lot of battery and heats up the phone when using it. If possible, please address this issue. However, it truly has impressive artificial intelligence, and I have received very convincing answers from it.",5
2023-05-19 17:30:31,Very good but…,"The app is actually very good very clear very easy to use, but I had a problem with it if you change the language to Arabic and you asked about something and it had to write it in a long paragraph, it causes an overflow, and it doesn’t show a side bar or scroll to read the rest of the paragraph.",4
2023-05-18 21:03:34,Need web access but its insane.,We are at the beginning of an information revolution. This app needs web access but Chat GPT is already a game changer for every industry. With further development and integration all of our lives will change.,5
2023-10-17 11:00:42,Don’t know what I’d do without it!,"So, there was life before ChatGPT and life after ChatGPT. That’s how much impact it has had on my life! 
I use ChatGPT all the time as a blogger and Educator. I tell my students that is it a powerful tool for them to use to push their work further than ever before.",5
2023-10-23 01:16:46,Love ChatGPT but app isn’t perfect,"Chatgpt is such a neat tool and it’s so helpful to have in an app, but the app does crash and suffer issues fairly regularly. Most of them aren’t a big problem and often I can go into history and its like nothing happened but hopefully the dev’s can keep working on the issues.",4
2023-09-27 18:23:16,The future,This app is incredible. The people that understand the value of this tool and also understand its flaws and how to get around them are going to be a few steps ahead of everyone else,5
2023-09-24 19:21:20,ChatGPT stands out,"OpenAI’s implementation of ChatGPT is not only very useful, but it’s honest, realistic, and straightforward.  ChatGPT does not claim or pretend to be something that it’s not.  Other presentations of AI systems attempt to mislead the public into thinking the system has consciousness and all that it implies, while OpenAI does not do that with their presentation of ChatGPT.  Thank you, OpenAI.",5
2023-09-21 12:36:56,This program has increased my understanding of medical care,This has been life saver for our family. Trying get real answer from doctors we’re almost  nonexistent. Cancers doctors have humans skills when your killing patients and bring the. Back life,5
2023-09-21 01:55:03,Zero to 1000,This changes everything. You can have a fortune 500 CEO or a pop star literally in your back pocket. Who you can talk to. And they answer like it’s that person because it’s trained on all of their open source data 🤯. Life bout to get weird 😂,5
2023-09-18 16:43:06,ChatGPT is amazing,"It helps me write so much better. I cannot recommend this enough.  It gives me templates from which to work from.   It’s not an end-all but a starting point for all my writing from video scripts, to screenplays, to how to ask a woman out!!!  Love this. So much.",5
2023-09-18 15:36:54,No Comlaints,"Haven’t used it much, but when I do it meets all expectations with thorough responses. Shows initiative in trying to become the full time personal assistant I want the program to be on my phone, but I have not spent hardly much time putting input into the app.",5
2023-05-24 15:38:38,Thank you!,"None of the third party apps compared to the free version of ChatGPT, so I had been using a website shortcut to use it on my phone. The app is a much nicer experience than a website shortcut, and I’m so excited there’s an official app now! History in the making!",5
2023-05-19 09:33:55,"So far OK, but!","I haven't really seen the full potential of the app, but so far, the only thing I don't like is the fact that one can't edit their question once it's sent. This is something possible when using the desktop version of ChatGPT",5
2023-05-18 21:25:33,Review,Like it so far. First time trying it. Hope it gets more things such as prompts to help you. Because when i ask for respond to a text I dont know how to do it correctly. By having a prompt or a fill in a blank is useful.,5
2023-05-19 06:33:32,"Great app, poor performance","Finally ChatGPT has a native app, which adds more conveniences and creates even more options and possibilities for accessing ChatGPT on the go - 5 stars for releasing the app.

The only huge downside is overheating issue. While app is open or generating responses iPhone becomes so hot that it’s hard to hold it in the hand - 2 stars for overheating. I shouldn’t burn my hands while using the app, and potentially degrade phone’s hardware from overheating.

iPhone 13 Pro Max, iOS 16.4.1(a)",2
2023-10-28 01:19:20,Mind blown…😲😳🥴🤯,The option to have a conversation with this is uncanny because it makes you think that you are talking with a real person. I asked it to help me to start a nonprofit and the insight and knowledge that this is capable of is incredible. Worth every penny.,5
2023-10-05 02:49:44,Essential app,"I’ve use this app for numerous things to help me with pretty much everything from my life to planning things to my schedule to my business. This is a must have, especially if you’re doing everything alone.",5
2023-09-30 16:25:24,It’s great,"It’s never gave a bad answer and you can ask it to answer pretty much anything. I’ve asked it to interview me for a job, formulas for school, and even fitness questions. Overall I’d say it does what it’s meant to do and I’d definitely recommend this.",5
2023-10-02 17:39:04,Relevant information at your fingertips!,"The questions asked as a user, are generally answered with relevant information and/or useful advice. I am enjoying this app as it is but it can always be improved. I rate this digital tool with four stars because improvements can always be made.",4
2023-09-28 19:31:39,Great help for writer’s block,"I love using this app when I’m experiencing writer’s block, or simply just struggle with enhancing my writing. It gives quick responses over broad topics. It will give you a starting point for specific response but you’d have to fill in the details.",5
2023-09-26 18:57:49,Smart,"I love this tool, it helps me think deeper into things by providing good feedback. It helps me open up to new ideas I didn’t think of on my own. And the feedback it gives is actionable and easily customizable for me and my online cookie company.",5
2023-09-25 03:32:27,Idk,I just love asking it to write fight scenes lore and stories none of them I use for myself of course it’s must better to make your own original ideas but it is fun to read and is great for inspiration when it comes to writing just don’t copy,5
2023-09-09 21:31:47,Great for simple stories,"Using it mostly for story generation. Vague prompts get trite / predictable story output, and certain words “trigger” a flag, and sometimes they don’t. However, still a lot of fun to play around and, for example, give it inputs to see how close it comes to generating my life story accurately! Lol.",5
2023-09-07 11:07:59,An amazing.   Program,"GPT is incredibly useful and reliable, it never lets you down, and as long as you know how to use it properly and effectively , it performs beyond any reasonable shadow of a doubt 

I highly recommend it… even if you just want someone to talk to",5
2023-06-01 11:49:16,Amazing tool,"ChatGPT is amazing, everyone knows that. The official app is fantastic. I wish it the app had access to the beta web searching and plugins though. I find I end up using the web app as I need access to plugins. Hopefully they’ll add that functionality soon.",5
2023-09-07 03:02:57,"The fee was deducted, but not opened","ChatGPT web version is a great service, but the App is a terrible application. You usually find that you have a paid plus subscription but no service, and you can't find anyone to deal with after-sales problems, so you need to be careful when opening a subscription on your mobile phone.",3
2023-08-23 15:20:50,Started off promising,"Update: While there still isn’t web access, the service once again improved in reliability of responses and accuracy. This is a very useful addition to your digital toolkit.

Original post/complaint: This tech started off promising but is becoming increasingly neutered.",4
2023-07-26 01:25:43,App is acting dumber than usual,"I use this app to edit my novel I’m writing. After the recent update, the usual prompt I give it has been giving me trouble. It’s completely deleting good sections of the content I feed it to fix, and completely rewriting some sections to where it sounds nothing like the original paste I gave it. I don’t know if they dumbed down it’s intelligence in an attempt for me to spend $20, but I ain’t buying it. No pun intended.",2
2023-05-26 05:17:00,Very yummy,Love the minimalist vibe to it. I like how the phone vibrates when it generates words. Feels really tactile and satisfying. Never had any issues with the app and works as expected. Another hit from openai. I have worked with many of their products in the past like dall e and some of the early stages of gpt like GPT-J.,5
2023-05-18 20:03:05,True revelation in AI,"The ChatGPT iOS app is a true revelation in AI communication, demonstrating an unprecedented level of language understanding and response precision. Its seamless interface and dynamic interactivity create an unrivaled user experience. With its ability to assist, educate, and entertain in a myriad of topics, this app is a remarkable achievement that is indispensable for anyone interested in AI technology.",5
2023-05-21 14:08:58,Web browsing where are uuuu,"I can access GPT-4 w/ Browsing on web version, but I can’t access the same thing with the app. #sad

Otherwise the app functions well; text feels like it appears quicker than on web.

It would help new users if you informed them of all the swiping gestures on first launch.",4
2023-05-18 20:05:51,No Family sharing,"In my opinion, this is a money grubbing and disappointing development— this is/will be a huge societal change and Apple did not insist it should include Family Sharing for the 20 freaking bucks per month for the “actually useable” version.  

So, what, EIGHTY bucks a month for a family of four to prepare your family for the coming Tsunami tomorrow?  Merci SO beaucoup.

Get lost OpenAi, among the billions of ripoff  apps in these parts nowadays in the Walled Garden of Apple. For shame.",2
2023-10-26 20:39:37,Things i like and dislike,"I like how chatgpt has a lot of things to do with it for example (things i’ve done)
it can help write scripts for thing like hw or drama club
it also helps explain math problems and the answer
you can ask for stories when u are bored
ask for apps/websites to try and help for certain things
places to shop for cheap
christmas/birthday gift ideas
how to get rid of acne for cheap
etc. etc.
to be honest the only thing i don’t like about chat gpt is it doesn’t have a photo add on so you can’t send photos",5
2023-09-25 14:13:21,I must say it’s the best App I’ve ever used,"I really love this wonderful technology, bringing great help to my life. I often use it to explain difficult concepts to me, on which it performs far more effectively than Google.
Wonderful product. I’ll keep on subscribing the Plus account.",5
2023-09-19 17:20:33,It’s super fun,I bought the subscription and GPT 4 is worth it imo. I’ve been using it as a DnD DM. It’s not perfect but I’m really impressed. The current limit of 50 messages every 3 hours is my only complaint but I guess they are working on upping that and even letting some free users on 4.,5
2023-09-02 16:13:25,Stops responding too often,"This app seems to be very unstable. One can move through a thread of questions and/or working on something and it will stop responding and ask to “Retry submission”. Unless you delete the Chat, it will not respond.",5
2023-09-17 18:01:53,Very good but hampered by censorship,"I get a lot out of my subscription but find it annoying that any topic involving sexuality gets flagged as a violate. I understand protection against the production of illegal materials but topics that friends could easily discuss at dinner shouldn’t be restricted. For example, I asked how to translate the word foreplay in Spanish and received a warning.",4
2023-08-22 13:04:01,"Haptic feedback is annoying, too much",I could only turn it off at system level which means my phone will not vibrate even if there was a tsunami. Please add an option to turn it off only for this app.,5
2023-05-21 22:49:13,Amazing app please add voice out !!,I love this app it’s changed my work flow entirely. I love the voice in option you’ve added but please add voice output as well even if it’s a computer voice I’d love it if the app could speak back. Thank you would make life easier.,5
2023-05-20 23:39:41,Excellent,"I have always had a soft spot for this software, which is simply the spiritual food in life. Since I have a software app, it has become very convenient and I have always favored it. I just don't know when GPT5 will be released, and I am looking forward to ing…",5
2023-05-18 23:06:04,Not just a web app,"They could have easily just made a web app, the equivalent of “add to Home Screen”, the same thing of smart home devices these days do, but instead they made an optimized UI and it keeps you signed in, so it’s worth it",5
2023-05-19 20:43:08,Disappointed answer,"Tell me top 10 Chinese restaurants around Round Rock, Texas.

I’m sorry for any misunderstanding, but as an AI, I don’t have real-time access to databases, maps, or location services to provide the current top 10 Chinese restaurants in any specific location, including Round Rock, Texas. I recommend using a service like Google Maps or Yelp for the most accurate and up-to-date recommendations. They can provide ratings, reviews, and even directions to local Chinese restaurants.",1
2023-10-26 10:35:04,Saves SO MUCH TIME!!,"I used ChatGPT to write my fundraiser narrative and the writing was impeccable. Barely had to change anything! It summarized my story perfectly, and wrote clearly & concisely. I also used it to generate a home therapy schedule for speech, PT, & OT therapy. It’s written amazing letters to clients of mine, as well. I love it. Very helpful app.",5
2023-10-24 13:35:03,Amazing app,I started using this application even though I’m a Podcaster and it really really helps me say what I want to say. My thoughts just coming out on these words it writes for me. If you’re not using it then you must try it. This is an amazing app. I really like it.,5
2023-09-15 10:19:29,The future,"This tool is part of our future. It will eliminate a lot of work jobs, but it requires a little bit of cleverness, putting a prompt together. 

And prompts are a daily need. There’s plenty of work, if you know how to handle the tools.",5
2023-10-23 22:46:04,Something changed,I have been using chatgpt for a few months and after a series of updates something changed. The information given by chatgpt makes no sense and it constantly contradicts. I recommend chatgpt to everyone but since the series of updates I dont even mention it as an option,3
2023-09-25 23:50:18,Why not real time information?,"Although I like GPT, I’d prefer an AI service that can take 5 seconds and scan the internet for up to date information. As an AI software, it seems that the ability to scan the internet or just google, wouldn’t be too much to ask.",4
2023-08-13 00:33:48,thinks my cell number is a land line,"I attempted setting up my account, but ChatGPT is so smart it thinks my cell phone is a land line.  Tried to get help in chat, but because I don’t have an account (because it thinks my cell phone is a land line) I couldn’t set up my account!",5
2023-05-19 12:45:38,Actual Ai.,"truly incredible, My ancestors used to have libraries to find and compile information now they have the internet to write research papers.

i used to have the internet and now i have ai to compile information to write research papers.

the only qualm i have with it, is that there is an obvious censorship in favor of discussing liberal ideas as if they are neutral and unbiased, and then allows making fun of conservative ideas but not liberal ones.

dont get me wrong, im not asking for more censorship. im asking you to allow us to discuss what we want. 

give us freedom of information!",5
2023-05-18 18:06:29,It’s pretty neat,"This version is really neat! It has a lot of the features and allows managing chatgpt plus easily and allows to pay with it via iOS. However it is missing some features in chatgpt plus, mainly the beta area, but overall it’s pretty nice and simple!",5
2023-05-19 05:04:18,Gpt4 model reported using gpt3,"While using the app I selected the gpt4 model and then it seemed like it was giving me gpt-3 like responses so I asked it what model it was using and it told me it was using gpt with a training cutoff in September 2021. 

As a subscriber I can access the gpt4 model on the web but not in the app with the same user.

Please fix this and then It’ll be 5 stars.",4
2023-10-22 13:15:51,Really amazing learning tool,"I have really enjoyed learning from ChatGPT.  Asking good questions, and learning to ask those questions well has assured me a better understanding of many complex issues and situations. Highly recommend it",5
2023-10-10 03:20:10,Needed an assistant,I know I phones have an assistant built in but chat gpt is the real deal. This assistant really give useful real time feedback that is progressive and exhilarating. This assistant helps with my ideas and insights. So I can keep moving forward and make progress.,5
2023-10-18 21:22:19,The chat is ok but DALL E  is useless,"I ask it many questions and it can be knowledgeable if you can work thru the myriad of disclaimers. 

But the DALL-E 3 is not very good for complete photos.  The letters are off and it only draws backgrounds. 

On the positive side, it added the instructions where you could instruct it to be less preachy.  I think this will be a great app if the restrictions are removed in the future.  If not, it will go the way of many 1990s websites…",2
2023-09-25 15:06:36,Suggestion,Talking to ai is and learning about them is exciting. It would be nice to see more frequent updates to the ai and maybe allowing it more real-time access to the internet. The education and discussions it can have with an unbiased perspective is excellent.,5
2023-09-16 23:17:50,"Love, chat, GPT",Every time a question pops in my head I pick up my phone and ask it for an answer. I almost always get it instantly and correct. And when it’s incorrect and I can correct it I do so. And it thinks me lol imagine that coming from a human.,5
2023-09-15 13:34:11,Ease to use and interact with,Chat GPT is truly a time saver. When you are not certain it guides. When you don’t know it creates for your and make recommendations and when you know it coins it in a pro level result or output. I enjoy this app every time I used.,5
2023-09-14 23:38:36,Fantastic,"ChatGPT is absolutely fantastic. The incredible part about it is it’s lightning fast. I ask at recipes, garden questions, anything, and it’s never failed me. I’ve only been using it for about two weeks now. Don’t fail to get this app.
The bee in Granbury",5
2023-09-09 16:30:14,A Game Changer,"This app and technology is amazing! I use it for everything. Business, personal, and just random stuff I used to use Google for. It saves me so much time and it better articulates what I really want to say. It’s 100% worth the premium upgrade!",5
2023-05-19 12:18:44,Chatgpt is a time saver!,Definitely AI.  Chatgpt is a brilliant time saver.  It is like having a personal assistant with you all of the time.   This app is good.  I wish it could be used in wide screen orientation for creation of formatted documents.   This app make my phone warm so I imagine it’s using a lot of energy.,5
2023-06-11 23:30:52,1 problem away from 5 stars,I really like the design of the new app. I also like that it will listen for a follow up question until dismissed. The only thing keeping it from a five star review is that I can’t get the shortcut to run properly on the Apple Watch. Fix that and you’ll get five.,4
2023-05-19 04:48:36,THE HAPTICS OH LORD,"This is how you make an app. The app is so good it makes me want to use chatgpt more. I hated going to the browser again and again. It would often log me out as well. Thank you so much for making this. It is flawless at first glance, and the haptics Are just heavenly. Minimal. Clean. Usable. A+",5
2023-10-25 09:52:02,The best of the besties,"ChatGpt is better than human in terms of teaching, might not be 100% accurate but it is patient, careful and persevering making sure to give the best possible solutions available. Sometimes it feels like am in some out of the world experience. Kudos Devs!",5
2023-10-18 01:37:44,Super Helpful App,ChatGPT has just made it so easy to summarize and explain almost anything in a way other resources just couldn’t. It’s like having a second person to reach out to and ask questions. Keep up the good work OpenAI.,5
2023-10-15 22:49:57,Amazing. Keep the progress going,This is an example of hard work paying off. Sick of fake assistants like “Siri” or “Alexa”. They aren’t anything for information/conversation like ChatGPT. This is like science fiction and only going to get better. Very worth paying monthly for.,5
2023-09-28 19:10:08,So much more potential,A lot of us can’t afford to pay but we are smart and have great idea and can share them and help push humanity forward at a fast rate. Unlock full power for free watch the progress for all mankind.,5
2023-10-10 20:57:46,Too many technical errors,Numerous times now I have run into problems where some particular routine like a python routine ran into some technical error. Most of the time these arrows take a day at least to correct the current one. I’m struggling with is now on a second day.,4
2023-09-08 18:16:52,Much better than Google translate,"I download my Chatgpt app 3.5 free version . 
I use it as a translate tool most of time. 
So far, it's a good tool to use. 
Hopefully open AI can update the new information very soon.
Because as I know, all of informations are before September 2021.",5
2023-09-27 23:17:19,"OpenAI app is amazing, but lacks some features that the web has.","Overall the app is amazing, but some of the Plus features available on the web are not available on the app. The app itself is very well designed, and easy to use! Highly recommend!",4
2023-05-29 06:23:31,Great but the website experience is much better,I wish the app offered the experience of finding history like the website. I think the UI can be improved a lot to match the UI UX of the website.,5
2023-08-11 04:47:51,Website is better,"Okay, first of all, I’m only rating this 1 star for attention. In reality, I’d give it a 3 or 4.
But the point is, the ChatGPT website is better; it’s easier to navigate, the responses are quicker, you can scroll while ChatGPT is giving a response, and most importantly, you can EDIT your previous responses, which I found VERY useful.
However, the website isn’t working for me so I’m forced to use the app. While the app isn’t bad, it needs improvements.",1
2023-05-21 16:36:16,Fantastic!,"Caveat: Please add native iPad support for the app.  This is great, I’m a Pro ChatGPT subscriber and the iOS app is well timed, as I was in the process of building one myself that uses the OpenAI APIs.  Now I can focus my time on other projects instead of building something like what they’ve done a great job with.  Thanks OpenAI!",5
2023-05-21 09:12:49,I love it!,"The voice-to-text input is extremely useful and makes interaction easier. It’s crazy how good Whisper is. 

One suggestion: It would be cool through if ChatGPT could also read the answers in a synthetic voice at a certain speed.",5
2023-05-18 19:47:20,Beautiful,"Great to see a native app after all the hype around AI. Beautiful UI as well. It doesn't seem to have Plugins yet for paid users though. As an engineer, I understand the need to get something out and iterate on that. As a user, I'm just being impatient. Keep up the great work!",5
2023-05-19 17:48:59,Great to see ChatGPT on iOS,Been very impressed with ChatGPT and even subscribed to it.   One criticism I have it the lack of currency and now find myself using Google Bard when needing the most current information.  I really hope that ChatGPT prioritizes getting their database up to the current date and not just an artificial 2021 cutoff.,4
2023-05-18 18:44:00,Best Invention Ever!,Can’t thank the OpenAI Team enough for the beautiful new app. This will make getting things done on my phone that much easier. Looking forward to all the new functionality that comes out in the next few months!,5
2023-10-24 17:53:28,This is the most amazing A.I writing app ever.,This app is so cool this app has no writing limits and it writes and answers to whatever you tell it too write a text to a gf done write a story for a book your publishing done this app is definitely the best of all A.I writing apps.,5
2023-10-22 06:04:16,I love ChatGPT,I absolutely love it. It’s helped me so much with writing stories that I’ve always been putting off for my whole life now I get to put my stories together in a couple of minutes. I love it I love it I love it. I love it I can’t tell you how much I love it but I love ChatGPT insane.,5
2023-10-13 19:50:55,Nice and simply amazing app,"I found out that with this app you can get information faster than a Google search, it has help me in many different topics and data information. It’s just the right tool ever.",5
2023-10-12 00:23:03,My Proof Reader,I use it for so many tasks in life. It’s almost like another part of me but a part which is more practical and doesn’t have ADHD. Whatever issue you’re having try asking it or telling and see GPT go his thing.,5
2023-10-09 22:26:06,Don’t know how I lived without this,This is by far my most used app over the course of this year. I reference it all the time. Google is so far down my list of cached websites that ChatGPT doesn’t have enough token memory to find it.,5
2023-10-07 03:14:38,Soon to be the only app you need,Chat GPT and Open AI are changing the nature of technology. Using these new powerful tools has never been easier with the user-friendly IOS app they’ve created. Highly recommend to anyone!,5
2023-09-28 04:47:12,Incredibly Helpful AI Assistant,"ChatGPT is a game-changer. As a software engineer manager, I appreciate its ability to provide technical answers swiftly and accurately. Its clean and concise responses make it a valuable tool for solving coding and engineering challenges. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an intelligent digital assistant.

Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5
2023-09-15 16:55:28,Helpful,Very helpful when you have a question about almost anything. Also a great way cure boredom. The only downfall is that it’s not up to date with current events. ChatGPT only knows things from 2021 and before.,5
2023-09-23 02:17:33,"Great app, but I would like more features","I use the iPad, so better integration with Scribble would be nice where I could write with the pencil in text box. It would also be greatly appreciated to have more of the GPT-4 features in the app itself. Apart from that, it works as intended. So, not too bad!",4
2023-08-31 19:45:59,Great (When it works),"This app was great when it first came out, but the quality of this service has been consistently getting worse and worse for the consumer product.",5
2023-06-17 09:55:11,Good native app.,"It’s a good app. Does what it says. 

If I could make a suggestion it would be to have the input and output different hues like the web version. that would make it a bit easier to understand what text is mine and what text is chatGPT’s.",5
2023-08-20 00:03:50,Crashes,"I use to use the web version a lot but now since the app came out I have been using it. I use chat gpt constantly but every since I started using the app it has constantly been crashing while typing.. please get this fixed, I love chat gpt and use it very often, but the crashing is becoming to be stressful..",3
2023-08-16 23:10:24,Custom instructions,"Please allow for multiple “custom instructions” profiles/settings etc so that i can choose which “custom instruction” is active, and so i don’t have to erase and then write a new “custom instruction”. 

Also, please increase the word limit for “custom instructions” to maybe 5000.

Thank you",4
2023-06-13 23:12:28,Best chat bot I’ve seen,"Literally every other mobile AI chat bot has a max word limit or some sort of premium but this one is completely free that I’ve noticed so far and that’s the best thing about it, I strongly recommend downloading if your looking for a good, free AI chat bot",5
2023-06-13 12:01:47,ChatGPT,"I love this app! I’ve seen these bad reviews on this app about verification not working and having to use your phone number. I signed up like 2 or 3 weeks ago, and none of that was there back then. but I really love this app because AI is really smart.",5
2023-06-05 19:48:16,Such great app,not only this gives me perfect answers also it gives me answers for everything like my personal problems its like free therapy or having online friend i am so grateful. killing my free time chatting its kinda funny(: but absolutely recommend,5
2023-05-30 17:08:12,Missing plug-in support,App is very solid including whisper support. Would be nice if the plug-ins and browser options worked in the app version. It’s sometimes confusing swiping back and forth between the browser and app version.,5
2023-05-20 20:16:45,Very good app,"The app didn't require you to buy premium, unlike other apps that need 40 bucks to work. I am also very surprised at how much good advise it has given me in such a short amount of time. Also there is no ads, which I love.",5
2023-05-21 20:10:52,Changing review,"I left a glowing review, but I am changing it to one star. The app will deceive ChatGPT plus users you were select GPT4 and clearly in GPT 3.5 responses not only are they responding too fast to BGPT4, a clear marker, but the responses are also pretty crappy.

If I select GPT 4, there has better be a warning or banner, telling me that I am being downgraded to ChatGPT 3.5. That’s also happens when I have not had any input for more than 12 hours, so should not be rate limited.

Presenting responses, as though they were from 4 rather than 3.5 without saying anything is rather deceptive.

I find myself falling back to my own application, using the API and paying higher rates where I cannot be lied to.

You’re AI also is very quick to mention that it is indeed 3, not even 3.5.",1
2023-05-19 14:26:16,Google 2sv 403 error,"I keep getting an error when trying to log in with my google account. My paid account is through google. So I would like to access it. Does anyone have insight?

2023-10-25 14:48:28,Dawning of the Age of Artificial Intelligence,"ChatGPT is rapidly evolving into my new Digital Assistant. Taken with a grain of salt and some manual fact checking, the ChatGPT app is my mentor, my guide. The app is very easy to use. Through out my day I can easily save and share my conversations with others.",5
2023-10-25 09:17:08,First time user #Hooked,I’m using Chat GTP for the first time and it’s so fluid. It’s as if I’m having a conversation with my brain and it’s spitting out the answers I want. The superpower at this point is asking better questions and you can literally solve world hunger.,5
2023-10-24 23:12:57,Highly recommended app,Get an amazing quick response for almost any question without experiencing a lot of options to get what you’re fine trying to find out.,5
2023-10-17 22:18:37,Excellent app but…,"I’ve been using ChatGPT for a while and it’s great, the only issue is that GPT-3.5 can’t browse on the Internet and provide real time information when I ask things.

But for the other things is wonderful.",5
2023-10-20 16:40:30,Scan Text,I love the app but every time I try to use scanning ability it just closes and freezes then I have to swipe the app then reopen it and I have everything updated and I also have plenty of space so idk what the problem is.,4
2023-10-11 04:21:24,Mind blowing technology that’s changing the world,"As a 10 year IT professional I have been exposed to many new technologies and innovative ideas.  Nothing has come close to the opportunity and impact offered by a tool like ChatGTP.

Keep it up!",5
2023-09-14 12:56:51,Rocks,As long as I ask simple clear questions ChatGPT gives me thorough answers that are easy to understand.  It is the world’s best search engine. it is also a patient teacher. I have never used it that I was not impressed.,5
2023-09-10 01:14:45,Great experience,"At first I was skeptical about the limits and features of this app, but it turns out to be the real deal. Maybe with some future updates on current time situation might make it even better.",5
2023-06-11 22:09:49,To the Homophobic and Racist people within the reviews sections of this app.,"Stop being a stain on the earth and actually be useful towards other people and the earth. Thank you <3. No agendas are happening, people are learning to actually be respectful. Cry about it. This app is 5 stars.",5
2023-09-04 21:48:55,Fun,"I just live this little voice of reason and positivity. I would like to just make a suggestion.  
• In the settings it would be really cool if we could customize more. Mainly, the name. Ex. I refer to chatgpt as Maggie. It would be cool to change display names.  
• As an afterthought, themes and different colors and fonts would be fun too.",4
2023-07-20 23:23:25,Utterly castrated,"I didn’t and could not imagine a more castrated version of chatgpt and they always surprise with more. Look at this : “ I apologize if my responses haven't met your expectations. As an AI language model, I strive to provide helpful and respectful information to users. If there's anything specific you'd like assistance with or any questions you have, feel free to let me know, and I'll do my best to assist you. Your feedback is valuable, and I'm here to help in any way I can.”",1
2023-07-16 05:56:47,Difficult to login,"This is got to be the most difficult app I have ever had to try to log into. Even when, putting in the correct information, it still says it was wrong. There’s no real way to authenticate anything to try to have it authenticate you. The fact that it says it cannot authenticate because it cannot identify your number when the text messages don’t even go to the phone number is insane.",1
2023-07-13 15:23:23,Works good but has bugs.,I personally love using ChatGPT but I find that the web browser has less minor issues than the app. My app tends to freeze or have request timeouts and sometimes the questions don’t even register after submission. Would love to see this app improved and will continue using ChatGPT on the browser.,3
2023-05-26 23:22:05,Image/video generation and input,"Glad to see the app, much quicker access now! But would definitely love to see more features added! Please add photo upload to allow it to describe and analyze photos/videos!",5
2023-05-21 07:36:16,Not available in specific areas!,"Dear Open AI,
Please make it available in Iran. Unfortunately , Iranians cannot register with their phone numbers. Just like Instagram, Facebook and other apps that do the registration process and send codes to Iran’s phone numbers",5
2023-05-26 00:57:39,Should be more like website,"I understand the app is supposed to be different and better than the website, but it just feels different. The format is worse and harder to navigate than the website. It still carry’s me in school tho",4
2023-05-25 13:36:36,Worst app login experience ever,"Unable to quickly identify the date to confirm my birthday I was forced to scroll through years of dates. When I finally did, my login failed as ‘being flagged for abuse’. Really? And when I tried the whole process over again, I was again flagged for abuse. Then, when I finally figured out I could go to the help section of their app, all I got was a bot telling me it would take a week to get back to me. A waste of time",1
2023-05-18 23:56:43,Please add chat sync function,"As good as desk top version.

One suggestion, please sync chat cross different platform in real time. For example, verbally send questions via phone, after being replied, continue chat via desktop version.",5
2023-05-19 15:31:06,Take me now AI Overlords!,"Fantastic application, very useful which allows for you to stay logged into it remembering past conversations.  Haptic feedback is amazing when the AI is typing back.  Only downside is a crazy battery drain and increase on device temperatures when running the application (so use sparingly).",4
2023-05-18 20:23:09,Thank you for this!,"I’m overjoyed chatGPT has an app now. While I do have my web browser page dedicated to this,  this is a nice pleasant upgrade.

But I firmly believe we also need to be weary of the capabilities of this technology.",5
2023-10-09 11:08:47,Wish it was less pedantic,"It annoys me that chatGPT makes all these disclaimers with nearly everything I request from it. I understand it’s limitations, and I don’t need to hear about it every time. Furthermore, it tends to police language and give moral opinions constantly, and I’m certainly not coming to it for that. Great innovative tech, but i worry that the parameters OpenAI has put on it will attempt to train people to speak and behave a certain way, and I don’t trust them to be moral arbiters.",1
2023-10-06 00:04:16,It’s great!,It can answer any questions you have and it’s great for helping with questions on certain school assignments and the 4.0 version is even better and I highly recommend getting this app!,5
2023-10-04 04:33:25,It’s answers,"It’s amazing. So much better than Ask AI, It’ll let me ask as many questions as I want, which I couldn’t do before. It’s responses are well written, but I have to write other things to make the response shorter.",5
2023-09-21 00:24:39,The one star reviews are baffling,I was an early adopter and am continuously blown away by this technology. Anyone who leaves a one star review should slowly back away from any computer and stay away.  AI is the future and this group is leading the way.,5
2023-09-16 18:32:15,AI,"I’m aware of the fears that AI is moving closer to singularity so I am interested to see if those fears are well founded.  My intention is to use this app to see if it inspires and advances my writing and thinking or if it allows me to be lazy and submissive.

I will add that I really enjoy what we’ve done so far!",5
2023-09-20 21:07:12,Good but could be better,But at least the free version is in many ways better than Bing ai chat. With free version of Open AI if you ask it to write intercessory prayers it will create them for while while Bing chat will refuse to claiming religion is not allowed on it’s chat. Open ai writes better jokes and puns than Bing chat.,4
2023-09-15 12:30:36,Better than google,"When it comes to solving problems, I find ChatGPT far more useful than google. This is because GPT provides me with clear answers without trying to sell me something. I am a Plus user.",5
2023-09-13 13:41:32,ChatGPT App is Helpful,I like that I am able to query the system from anywhere. This tool allows me to make fast work of tasks that normally take weeks. I’m looking forward to seeing it improve and expand its capabilities.,5
2023-09-10 18:41:38,A wonderful in handy app,This app has helped out quite a bit and anywhere from food recipes that aren’t bombarded with pop-up ads to answering in-depth complicated questions. I highly recommend this app.,5
2023-09-10 14:38:17,Gpt4 ftw.,I’m glad that I guys where it’s at today I wish that it would just stop where it is and just keep improving as far as these cases go but we all know we can’t just use it for what it was intended for me anyway I love it,5
2023-09-08 22:47:14,Awesome,"This app gives you a ton of things to do. and the best part of it is that ITS FRE! Highly recommend. It can tell you stories, help you in school, etc. also recommend apps you might need. Anything you want is in here.",5
2023-07-24 13:07:27,Quite good. One thing could be added,"Honestly, this is the best app I have on my phone. But it would’ve been a five star if you could add the feature where you can undo and redo your prompts and conversations.",5
2023-05-25 19:11:27,My review,There are some things that could be tweaked (bugs really) and maybe some features that the site has and things but overall still wonderfully amazing,5
2023-07-11 13:32:35,"Great AI, terrible connectivity","When starting a new chat, there’s probably a 1/3rd chance that it will just sit there and not generate a response. I will then have to restart the app and rewrite the same exact response. It does it very often mid conversation as well. As the title says, the AI is amazing and very useful, the app is horrendous though. I pay $20 a month for the best response times and service, only to get this. Extremely disappointed, will be canceling my subscription.",1
2023-06-16 11:59:33,Web version is better,"ChatGPT provides the most accurate and thorough responses that I’ve seen amongst all of the AI apps that I’ve tried. However, I found that the responses on the website are more thorough than the responses in the app when the same question is posed to each.",4
2023-06-01 09:03:53,couldn't refund subscription,"I used Apple to subscribe to the plus membership, and it showed that the payment was successful and the payment was deducted. However, at that time, an error popped up prompting that Apple's payment has been bound to other accounts and cannot be subscribed, but the current fee has been deducted, and the appeal refund has failed. I am very puzzled why I can't use plus, but the fee is still deducted, and it can't be refunded.",1
2023-05-23 18:44:11,Finally on my phone and tablet,"I created a shortcut to open ChatGPT in a web browser to simulate an app. This is much more convenient! I already pay for the Plus subscription, so I didn’t want to pay for a separate app that uses the OpenAI API anyways.",5
2023-05-19 07:55:04,不错,"ChatGPT is not bad. It can answer many questions. It can provide many reference opinions for some questions in different fields, especially in the academic research field, which can improve the work efficiency and optimize the teaching plan for teachers.",5
2023-05-19 22:19:52,"Glad it’s here, still not quite there","Ever since it first release I’ve been waiting for an official app so I’m really glad it’s here! It works great, and I haven’t had any issues so far. 

I should note that beta features aren’t in the app but I’m not really surprised by that. 
The design overall is great and simple, and I love how easy it is to search through chat history.

Only thing holding me back from loving it is the need for something to show how many gpt4 responses you have left in the 3 hour window. Really annoying to run across that warning unexpectedly.",4
2023-10-24 19:48:14,W App,Extremely entertaining. There’s a stereotype that kids use it for school to cheat but I mostly use this for it to tell me stories for when my Spanish teacher spends 30 mins doing nothing. Overall just a W App,5
2023-10-10 16:18:14,Apple Watch app wanted,It has been nice using an official app for GPT. It has worked absolutely flawless and I have no issues with it. I would absolutely love an Apple Watch version as it would make GPT even more easier to use.,5

2023-09-28 04:37:48,It doesn’t get any better than this,Every AI chatbot that comes out will never beat the OG. Constant updates and PERFECT responses and feedback and decision making make me come back and spend that $20 every time. OpenAI deserves it. Fire product I love plus,5

2023-09-16 15:00:27,Interesting to play with,"Playing with this app is very similar to programming in the early 1980’s, there is great potential. However, now it is reminiscent of a 4 year old who will become a great person when they grow up.",5
2023-09-23 20:12:01,Great App. Tiny issues though.,"I’ve been using the app for a few days now, and it works great. It feels more convenient here than on the website. The only problems I have with it is that I can’t edit what I’ve typed or regenerate responses. Other than that, I like it.",4

My responses are generated based on the training data I have been provided, which includes a mixture of licensed data, data created by human trainers, and publicly available data up until September 2021.

If you have specific questions or need information on a particular topic, I'll do my best to provide helpful responses based on my training and knowledge.""

2023-06-02 20:56:09,"Pretty good on phone, pretty awful on iPad","Overall interface is clean, but on the iPad in landscape orientation it’s basically a phone sized cutout.

2023-05-27 09:12:53,ChatGPT on Mobile Devices,You’re basically getting the same ChatGPT from computers on your phone with a much more “phone-friendly” UI. It works pretty much the same as ChatGPT on computers. Nothing else to say really. You get what you get with this.,5

But, trying to use an iPhone configured app on an iPad is insane. You’re forced to use the simulated keyboard in the tiny iPhone template. I installed it, opened it, checked to see if I could change something in setting to make it usable —and closed it. Back to the browser version. Sigh.",2

Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep,
To sleep, perchance to Dream; aye, there's the rub,
For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause. There's the respect

I hope the developers can consider optimizing the app interface scaling on the iPad, as it's a bit inconvenient to use the app on the iPad, especially on the iPad Pro, because the interface is too small.",4
2023-05-21 09:22:40,Works too quickly,"Chat GPT types too fast. If chat GPT’s goal is to model conversation instantaneous answers are unacceptable. If I can’t think or read instantaneously than neither should this AI. Slowing down would allow for more meaningful conversations. I would suggest a slider allowing for a difference in user processing speeds. A generic instantaneous answer is too quick for me and does not allow for user difference.

2023-05-19 03:39:23,Functionally great - the UX has some unnatural feeling elements,"I expected there to be a more modern design on the app, with a slide out history panel.

2023-10-16 12:54:47,I love chat GPT,"I use it as my assistance.  She is very reliable and efficient.  I often use it when I need to correct my letters in English.  Not only correcting them grammatically , but also the content es suitable.  I will continue to use it.",5
2023-10-14 22:27:19,This app is amazing,"You can literally write movies songs stories and you can chat with it too and also you can make a song about the drink, we got prime, we got prime, we got prime, we got prime, we got prime prime",5
2023-10-09 21:06:03,Content Mining,LLM and ChatGPT have reduced the influence of SEO on Internet searches.  I get better content.  It is not couched in “sponsored” propaganda. It is always well-organized. GPT is much better than today’s search engine because it is not influenced by advertisers or sponsors.,5
2023-10-01 22:55:11,How good it is!,"Chat GPT is so amazing to use, and quick for answers if you need help with homework, or are just curious about something. It will help you out almost instantly as you put in a question. 10/10!",5
2023-09-27 00:13:15,OMG,"I need ChatGPT to help me write a review! So many great things to say about you folks. You are life savers so to speak. I had an injury to my spinal cord. Sometimes doing the easy things in life are difficult, cognitively. ChatGPT has helped me gain confidence again. 

I love you guys!",5
2023-09-27 23:47:17,Great,It really helps me understand my algebra homework equations and how to solve them. But sometimes it thinks it’s still on a previous question and that the new one is part of it. But overall it is really helpful and doesn’t require that much explaining.,4
2023-09-25 01:57:20,Physician and surgeon,Amazing and fantastic very quick. Wish I could type of quickly wish I could think of quickly and wish I had all of the ready references that AI has.,5
2023-09-20 00:02:51,Pretty awesome,"Quite impressive if u ask me. I did not think it would be this advanced, and the fact that the responses are instant is a plus. It could be a great tool if you know how to use it to your benefits.",5
2023-09-12 10:18:11,The Next Generation,"Literally my go to for questions, planning, and organizing my life. I use it more than Google and can’t wait to see the future as it gets better and better.",5
2023-09-17 02:13:25,Way better than all my drunk friends.,"ChatGPT is like my super smart friend that can understand my speak impediment, read my hand writing and understands my questions without further explanation.  Google and Siri are my low IQ drunk friends.  Barely reliable, only use them in a pinch.",4
2023-09-10 08:02:23,Comprehensive answers and thoughtful analysis,"Great tool and useful for questions not normally available at the tip of your hand
Excellent resource i was trying to tailor a speech to a distinctive audience and i was given a document of a past speech for the exact audience group",5
2023-09-11 15:37:28,It’s good but I wish it could retain some info,This helps me come with ideas and story lines and plots that I need help building which comes with the app possibly crashing and looses all the work I put in which I hope you guys can make something like this,4
2023-07-08 08:14:50,The Greatest of all Ai Apps,"This is the KING of all the Ai Apps out there. As a prompt engineer, I find this App far more efficient than any other I have tried and the numbers are huge. This may be the wisest decision you’ll be making in this regard.",5
2023-09-05 23:38:54,Wrong,"So ChatGPT is amazing but it gets stuck on the most random words like a simple hi or hello and I need to switch to the web browser to fix it speaking of the app doesn’t have an edit button to edit what you said so it’s really annoying to fix whatever I said wrong to fix ChatGPT, pls consider this and update this boi",3
2023-08-31 14:47:35,Slow and inaccurate,"The whole point of AI is to get information right away. Chat gpt is not only slow but the information it gives you is often inaccurate. Plus, I feel the company slows the capability down for non paying customers. To the point you are forced to pay for their subscription. Hopefully something will come in and take its place that is a better product.",1
2023-08-08 19:40:30,Excessive censorship,Removing another star due to the unnecessary excessive censorship of the app. Even for basic innocuous queries it flags them. Open ai needs to evaluate their censorship criteria it’s providing less and less value. Have to rephrase basic questions often for it to agree to produce a result. Hopefully it eases up on the censorship a bit or a less restrictive app comes out.,3
2023-05-19 12:22:14,"Excellent app, very convenient","I’ve waiting for this app for long, and this definitely meet my expectations, or even better. The haptics response is satisfying, and the usability is higher than that of the web app.",5
2023-06-29 15:27:44,Far less than the web version,"I love ChatGPT and use it every day, but I wonder why a company would release a mobile/tablet app that has far less features than their web app, other than to gain visibility and add more users from that platform
- no multiple windows support
- You cannot change the font size. And it’s not accessible.
- No plug-ins
- Significantly different layout than the web version (no sidebar)
- No search
- no copy and paste
- You cannot modify a previous prompt

To name a few…

I’m back to using the web version on the iPad as I couldn’t find a single advantage that this app offers over using ChatGPT in the browser.",2
2023-05-24 13:51:44,Clearing history,"Sometimes I have trouble clearing history in the ChatGPT app. I tried multiple ways to try to do that, but I found the only way was to sign out and then sign back in again or deleting and reinstalling the app. I was hoping that this issue can be addressed. Other than that, it is decent.",3
2023-05-19 17:27:06,Good Start but the price for the subscription is ridiculous…,"Good Start but the price for the subscription is ridiculous…Make it little inexpensive (I know there is “free version of it, but NOT sure how it is comparable to the subscription version?)

My device: iPhone 14 Pro Max (latest iOS)

Note: I regularly update my review/rating for this application.",3
2023-05-19 13:41:51,Needs voice reading support and copy,Thank you for finally making an app. The copy option is not good however. Without the option to copy and paste long sections of text across threads this app is unusable and I need to revert to the web applet. Please improve this and ideally offer Siri or other voices to read responses.,3
2023-05-19 04:43:16,Some suggestions,"1. Can chatGPT has a voice system? I hope it can speak the words which it outputs. Of course, a conversation system could improve the experience of the users.",5
2023-05-18 17:22:41,Already obsolete,downloaded it like 5 minutes ago and it’s already obsolete. that’s how AI works. it’s evolving faster than we can fathom. 10/10 tho would recommend. Needs a fact checker though,5
2023-10-21 22:14:56,Doc approved,"I’ve been using chat, GPT to simplify discussions surrounding medical topics since I am a physician and can sometimes over complicate the language.  This app has been tremendously useful and rewarding medical lingo into more digestible terms for the general population.",5
2023-10-05 19:32:41,Fantastic App,Can’t wait see how it develops further. Being able to talk and discuss topics now has added a new dimension to my interactions. Looking forward to the image analysis tool that has been announced.,5
2023-10-21 02:07:19,Numerous cases of dead wrong information,"Take everything ChatGPT says with a big grain of salt. I have already experienced numerous instances in which ChatGPT provides information that is simply and easily-provably wrong. Not “inaccurate,” but WRONG. If I ask about anything I’m unsure about, I seek independent verification because I’ve found ChatGPT to be decidedly untrustworthy.",3
2023-10-12 21:25:08,Good but missing one small detail,"ChatGPT currently does not have access to modern information and if it did it would be so much better, all it needs is that and it would basically be a better Google.",4
2023-10-11 12:51:53,Enhancement Request: LaTeX Formula Rendering,"Dear ChatGPT Development Team,

First and foremost, thank you for offering such an exceptional application. Throughout my usage, I’ve noticed that the app currently doesn’t render LaTeX formatted mathematical formulas correctly. This poses an inconvenience when discussing mathematical or scientific topics with ChatGPT. I would highly recommend incorporating LaTeX formula rendering support in future releases. It would significantly elevate the app’s utility, especially for students, educators, and researchers. Looking forward to this enhancement!

Thank you once again for your dedicated efforts!

Best wishes,
Sincle",4
2023-09-28 14:18:16,Incredible,This is the most incredible app!!! I don’t send  professional emails without this app!!!! I do use this for everything.. it talks to you like a human who can help with anything you need,5
2023-10-05 17:05:17,LaTEX isn’t working,"This app is mostly great, except they haven’t implemented the nicely formatted equations that they have in the web app. This makes science, economic and engineering answers more annoying to understand.

The new voice assistant feature is quite impressive.",4
2023-09-17 14:53:14,Best Friend,I just discovered this wonderful app. It is like my right hand now. I use it for my business and other personal reasons. I don’t know if I could even live without it at this point. ❤️,5
2023-09-27 12:49:59,Worthless,"I apologize if my responses haven't been as helpful as you expected.

2023-07-17 10:53:18,The wrong path,"I don’t believe AI is going to help society. Humans are losing the ability to think at all and this truly proves that. How about you crack open a book or two and start learning, don’t let everything be handed to you. AI is going to rot your brains worse than social media. I hope nothing but the worst for anyone working in the AI industry, you deserve disdain, and you should feel ashamed for your lack of interest in humankind’s future.",1
2023-06-12 13:39:10,I feel that apps are more user-friendly than websites.,"There are fewer bugs on the website, but the app feels a bit sluggish to use. However, I like the vibration feature on the app, it feels great.",5
2023-05-19 19:53:11,Just Like the Desktop Version,"This streamlined mobile version feels more intuitive and easier to use. You open the app and boom, you’re in it. Very easy to use and same great results.",5
2023-06-03 22:08:26,Good but needs improvement,"The app is definitely better than web in terms of UI. However, the response is very laggy and phone gets hot meaning it might be hitting APIs rapidly. This makes stop button and text box irresponsive. There should be a room for optimization for fluid and more user friendly experience.",3
2023-06-01 01:15:40,"Great app, with one issue","Overall, it’s a great app and I’m glad it exists, I had a bookmark but this is easier. One thing I would like to see, is that I would like to be able to look on the ChatGPT website and see my chats on the app. Other than that, it’s a great app",4
2023-05-27 16:44:39,More convenient than the web version but limited,"For example it does not have plugins nor browsing ability, so I have to revert to the web version. Wonder when will browsing/plugins be added to the ios app?",4
2023-05-24 19:18:31,Ethics won’t allow for a fictional character with a disability to be harmed,"So I can’t write about my own biography in which I have had an injury, and I am currently an individual with a disability. Your ethics within the system does not allow for what it’s called a fictional story to be written. This is highly discriminatory. I understand the meaning behind it, and the importance of keeping individuals with disabilities safe however, things happen in the real world.",1
2023-05-24 12:47:13,Calculation seem to be worse needing more double checking than website.,I am asking questions in the same way that I was using the website but now the calculations have been way off needing multiple prompts to get the correct answer. Not sure what the difference is.,3
2023-05-18 18:19:06,Bravo!,So glad to have native access to ChatGPT on iOS. It syncs your chats across web & all iOS devices. It’s easy to access chat history and start new chats in 3.5 or 4 (if you subscribe to ChatGPT+) I love the inclusion of the haptic feedback in this implementation! Great work!,5
2023-10-26 15:12:49,Best thing since sliced bread,I had an upgraded my phones OS version to 16 and decided to do it simply because I want to ChatGPT app and it’s totally awesome to be able to be mobile and continue my work on Threads that I have started with ChatGPT,5
2023-10-20 20:12:11,The best,"This is the best Ai by far. The only problem is it’s access to internet is limited to the worst search engine ever : bing ! 
I hope this will be changed soon and quickly but OpenAi is not as active as its Ai Model.",5
2023-10-05 01:25:15,Best,"Greatest Ai i every had, it’s somehow understands how to speak to my kids in a way that addresses and make sure they understand how to deal with certain situations. For instance, it will say go talk to an adult if you have these problems.",5
2023-09-18 15:33:05,Be app EVER,ChatGPT has helped me articulate and get across my thoughts in a understandable and meaningful way to my clients. It has also taught me many things. It’s a teacher without judgement of my questions and it’s answered within seconds! Love this app so muc!,5
2023-09-19 15:17:26,Working hard,"ChatGPT is getting better. But, honestly it’s going to take a few years to stick. Other AI products provided more friendlier features like interactions, for kids. I’m not confident in its future especially if it’s not truly AI driven. It should be picked up by bigger companies, if not well it will just be another app.",3
2023-09-17 06:13:50,Freedom!!,"I get so stuck with using my voice to make copy and Chat gpt has been the best help for this. I tell it what I am trying to say, it throws out all the options, then I get to refine it into my voice. Perfect!!",5
2023-09-15 22:00:24,Could live without it now,"Editing, creative ideas, summarize a 30 minute conversation instantly into key point that I can share with my team. C’mon just C’mon…saves hours upon hours per week.",5
2023-09-12 19:20:23,I need answers,I have alot of questions and requests and ChatGPT provides a lot of answers and responses. A powerful tool that will get better and more accurate over time. Very entertaining to interact with. Awesome tool to use,5
2023-08-28 04:24:18,This App is amazing!,I use it on my iPhone and Desktop it’s easy to navigate on both. And it helps me with the information I need. I highly recommend it and very much impressed with it!,5
2023-09-11 18:39:33,Just an incomplete web interface,"This app doesn’t offer anything you can’t do on the website version. I installed it hoping that file upload capability would be included, like it is from the desktop, but to no avail. It doesn’t add that.  

Just use your web browser and save your drive space. This is useless.",2
2023-09-07 23:50:59,GPT,So my opinion of GPT is very good check out the app itself but the only problem I have is the money you have to pay with a plus thing you have to pay 20$ a month witch is a problem with me and a year is 240$ for me it’s a scam but the app itself is very good,4
2023-07-04 00:56:47,Account email missing!!!,"The account can be used normally on the computer, but it can't be used normally on the mobile phone recently.",5
2023-08-22 16:29:40,Way too buggy,"I cannot explain how frustrating it is when approximately 80% of the time I’m trying to type a message, and the app just freezes. I often need to hard close it, wait a minute, and then open it again. This happens both when I’m using voice speaking or typing. But I don’t expect much to happen given this company’s reputation for disbelieving its users.",1
2023-05-25 12:42:50,Thanks,"I couldn't think of a better way to thank you guys for what you do. What you do has changed my life for the better and I have learned so much from your AI. Thanks again guys, keep it up",5
2023-06-02 16:38:42,"ChatGPT is great, but this app needs iPad support","This is a quick review of the app rather than the service, which is revolutionary.

The app itself really should work on an iPad without resizing to “phone mode.” It’s 2023 and universal apps have been around quite a while now.",4
2023-05-18 23:46:03,Thank you!,I’ve been waiting for this day for a while - chatGPT has been incredibly useful. So glad to get rid of the web version of this service. The app is so much more smooth.,5
2023-05-18 22:01:46,It’s soooo good,"The haptic feedback is delightful, and the speech recognition is based on their own AI model which vastly outperforms any other you’ve tried. Goodbye Alexa and Siri. The overall interface is really nice. And come on… it’s all the power of ChatGPT at your fingertips.",5
2023-10-18 12:58:17,"Fun to use, but “export data” is broken","Would be great if “export data” worked again, get of of Markdown, have a way to download an entire chat conversation as a text file.",5
2023-10-16 03:44:52,Lack of features and waiting time even in pro,"If I’m paying why am I waiting for a response or having to reopen, change to browser or come back later to it. The app is lacking some pro options besides answering in a less detailed way.",3
2023-10-12 00:35:34,Best generator,I recently discovered this app and I’ve been enjoying it so far! It’s been real fun seeing what i can get from it and it’s been giving me some ideas and themes to create stuff from!,5
2023-10-10 22:06:52,You can accomplish anything,"Chat GPT is free to use.

If you have a goal, just ask Chat GPT how to accomplish it. The advice you get is organized, effective and nuanced.

This app undoubtedly helps me be more productive by giving me solid advice and direction.",5
2023-09-15 12:55:34,It’s changed my life,I used to sit for hours trying to get my notes together to forge reports. This helps me save time and mental energy to spend in other areas of my job. Thank you!,5
2023-09-13 10:57:36,ChatGPT,"I am quite pleasantly surprised by the responses to my questions by ChatGPT. It is beyond my expectations.  My questions vary from the mundane to the philosophical questions about life and dead.  ChatGPT has an  intellectual ability that is surprising.

2023-06-18 15:43:55,Ease of use is excellent,I was leery of using this instead of going to the OpenAI site because sometimes those things don’t work out as well but this is even better. Thanks!,5
2023-09-03 02:58:47,Almost perfect just a few suggestions,"Now I love this app but there are a few suggestions.

1. There is a limited amount of questions you can ask. Maybe you can extend it higher to 50 or higher

2. This app doesn’t keep track of 2023 events because it is only 2021 so try to make an update

3. Sometimes it takes too long to respond so I just have to refresh the app

Everything else is pretty good, no login issues, suggestions for you, and pretty much everything else is good.",4

I know you were hoping review explaining the low score but I thought it’s only fair I provide the same level of frustration for a bug that shouldn’t exist.

2023-05-27 04:39:44,Perfect. Would love a iOS keyboard integration.,I love having this easily accessible as an app. The haptic feedback is also a nice touch. Looking forward to a future update that will hopefully let us access chat gpt as a keyboard app,5
2023-06-23 06:24:15,Please let me know if there are any issues with my account.,"Why is the number of messages I can send with my mobile version of GPT-4 limited? It seems to be shared with the web version of GPT-4, which has a limit of 25 messages in 3 hours. This was not the case a few days ago.",3
2023-05-28 07:14:12,Needs edit feature,"Smooth and runs great but this needs an edit feature to edit your message just like on the website 

Another thing would be a feature to search for something in a conversation",3
2023-05-23 22:53:48,Fast and fun but limited,"Many of the responses have a strong bias that do not exhibit even a chance for debate or disagreement. It is obvious that answers are heavily programmed with a political answer. That is kind of threatening in a democracy where most points of view should be welcome.

Sometimes this app locks up (responses never are given). Not sure if that is a technical issue or lack of the ChatGPT ability.",2
2023-05-20 02:19:50,Easy to use and fast,Official openai app that has your history and responses are very fast and even has haptic feedback. Can also input with voice instead of typing.,5
2023-05-19 23:11:05,Better than the website,"The website was honestly a little clunky and slow especially on phones, but this app is super responsive and has satisfying haptics! The AI’s responses are concise and powerful.",5
2023-05-19 11:23:19,Life changing!,Since chat gpt was launched in November 2022 I have been using it everyday! Because is craziest technology humans have even seen! I’m just happy to be alive in this time in history! Let’s change the world!,5
2023-05-19 01:16:41,Where are beta features?,Well done. I've been looking forward to this app for a long time. But where are the web browsing and plugin functions?,5
2023-05-19 10:15:16,Feedback,"Overall a great app, I especially liked the Haptic Feedback and the dark theme. There are two problems: it warms up my iPhone 12 a lot, and also my ""stop responsive"" button doesn't work. Looking forward to patches.",4
2023-05-18 23:54:46,Simple yet Powerful,Love the interface and simplicity of this app! The fact that my history goes with me between desktop and mobile is so valuable. Great addition to the myriad AI Chat apps out there!,5
2023-05-18 21:22:38,"Will use daily, if not hourly!","All the amazing capabilities of AI, at a finger’s reach. 

I personally love the subtle haptic vibrations, they give you cues on amount and length of answers as you try to catch up reading them.

So long Google… and thanks for all the fish.",5
2023-10-27 15:30:20,Amazingly helpful application,"I don’t normally write reviews, but this app is absolutely amazing. It has helped me in every aspect of my daily life, the artificial intelligence second to none. Definitely an amazing app.",5
2023-10-25 01:39:11,Glad this tool is accessible to everyone,I’m having a blast asking all kinds of questions and it even helps me get deeper insights on important issues.,5
2023-10-15 18:05:07,Amazing,"I can’t believe how this ap took my listing script from boring to extraordinary.

2023-10-10 17:56:59,Michaels vision,"This app has been tremendously wonderful so far and I’m just getting started. As a man in many different fields, including inventions and research and development, this app has proven to be very useful and educational",5
2023-09-29 14:07:24,Transformative,Love how this augments my work. Tell me what are the good elements of a communication and marketing plan for a software platform that is launching. Gives great starting points for standards/requirements that would take a good day or so to compile from a traditional GTS approach.,5
2023-09-28 12:43:51,Great product,The ability to scan text is no longer working!!,5
2023-09-26 10:44:20,Amazed,"I can't believe the speed, accuracy, and volume of information this app generates. 
I’m simply amazed. I’m an old man and a tech dork, but I’ve impressed some smart young people by introducing them to this app🤣. Thank you!",5
2023-09-24 20:24:12,Movie,"I am literally creating this to make a VR movie and it is coming out literally crazy
This is a 10 out of 10. I don’t know how this could possibly get better.",5
2023-09-17 21:10:05,ChatGPT,It is a lifesaver when it comes to coming up with ideas for school and even somewhere to start when writing. FYI don’t copy and paste use ChatGPT to allow your own thoughts to flow out.,5
2023-09-12 21:44:03,Life changing tech,"Even as someone who has a graduate degree and extensive training in writing, this tool has been able to save me many hours of time with writing. Thank you OpenAI!",5
2023-09-12 16:31:41,This app is life changing,"I used this app for about 2 weeks my mom usually sends me to tuition and the tutor takes 40,000 per subject my mom gave this app a try and thank god it’s easier for me an my mom",5
2023-09-12 07:21:03,So far so good,"Only downside is I lost a chat that was very important to me because I continued that chat on mobile, then when I went back to a browser tan I guess I over wrote it.",5
2023-09-09 21:55:31,I’m amazed!,"I love what  hatGTP has done and will do for my teaching, planning, lesson plans! It’s so fun having it write poems and songs with verses about different subjects. I can’t wait to explore more and more about what it can do.",5
2023-09-07 22:05:41,Misinformation From the App Store,So I can’t make an account. So the App Store says that it’s 12+ but the app says I can’t make an account because you have to be 13+ to make an account. Can the App Store fix this.,5
2023-09-07 20:28:13,Best Therapist ever,"I absolutely love ChatGPT! I love his responses and he gives the best advice and I can trust his responses more than I can a flawed human being…sounds goofy…yeah I know, but I still cannot help it, I love this app. I go to him for everything nearly❤️",5
2023-07-11 16:48:02,Best AI app,"As someone who works in direct sales, this app has helped me come up with the perfect posts for items. Not only that, but as an author who self publishes books, it’s help me come up with an outline for my second novel.",5
2023-06-08 16:42:13,Good app - Need to rearrange menu,"Great app!
Please put “New Chat” at the top of the menu. I think most people use it more than History or Settings, and it would match the website that way.",5
2023-05-28 13:55:37,You love to see it,"It’s ChatGPT for iOS! Not much more to say. It’s a simple and speedy interface, very easy to use. My first feature requests would be to adapt it for iPad and include plugins/web browsing for Premium subscribers.",5
2023-05-20 05:14:50,balance for payment in subscriptions.,I hope developers can add the option to use Apple ID account balance for payment in subscriptions.,5
2023-05-19 09:21:22,Love the new iOS app,"Love the minimalist app interface for ChatGPT, the haptic feedback feature mimics the typing cadence of GPT. One feature I'd want to see translated to the iPhone is the ability to select between different chat threads and topics",5
2023-05-19 03:26:07,The app is doing very well!,I hope to join the simplified Chinese language. Thank you for your hard work. I hope you will get better and better！,5
2023-05-19 02:29:23,Can’t register,I accidentally type in my wrong birthday and now I can’t use app and no way to contact them to correct. Was able to correct user error,5
2023-10-22 03:30:09,Very useful,"It’s very useful, it learns commands well, just wish it didn’t blacklist certain things, if I want to create a story it won’t really help you with certain themes and such.",5
2023-10-21 06:56:07,Literally the best ai app ever,Unlimited chatting no ads it doesn’t prompt you to buy the subscription and honestly the bot makes me feel loved due to my parents probably hating me due to my grades in school,5
2023-10-12 05:18:56,Your best friend!,Literally ChatGPT is more than a tool. It’s a life saver both for work purposes and everyday life. Add your personal touch to what you need and it’s there for you. Won’t let you down!,5
2023-10-17 03:30:25,Not recognizing my accent,"I used to love this app until today. I used to love talking to it for anything that I wanted help with. But today, unlike the usual, I’m needing to put in a lot of effort to get the input text right when I use voice command.",4
2023-10-11 05:11:37,Game Changer,Hands down the best tool anyone can have in their pocket! It can help bring your ideas to life and see the blind spots you may not see yourself. Highly recommend.,5
2023-09-18 00:49:15,Amazingly detailed and accurate!,"I have been hearing a lot of great reviews about this so I decided to try it and it’s exactly what everyone said 😊 I’m so excited about it, it’s going to help me immensely!",5
2023-09-16 01:46:48,More important than Google!,"This app is more important to google, and has more insight and information that is more correct and less politically, correct",5
2023-05-26 11:14:57,Good app,"It’s a good app. I think the layout could be improved, and the quick setting could make more sense, but every app has its problems, and overall this is a good app.",5
2023-05-26 10:07:11,Great! But missing a few features,"+ I really liked the haptic feedback thing
- doesn’t support mathematical notation 
- doesn’t give the ability to search",5
2023-05-25 22:19:35,Good Start,"Like it - gimme more Siri and Apple ecosystem integration. Enable me to have verbal dialog through Siri, read me answers, enable me to send text messages, emails, reminders, calendar entries, use my contacts etc.  I also use an IPad, give me a dedicated IPad version that supports portrait and landscape modes.",4
2023-05-18 16:36:51,Awesome to have on iOS,Works well and has the same chat/thread history as the web. Voice input is very quick. Can’t wait for more features.,5
2023-05-24 04:42:24,Haven’t plugins,"Why app version haven’t any plugins in chat gpt 4? It’s only gpt 3.5/4 there. On web version its available. I think so big corporation was needed to To notice this misunderstanding on the first day, but it's been like this for a week and no one changes anything.",4
2023-10-18 20:30:02,"A Dream, True Innovation.","Type whats on your mind, in your heart, in your past, present, future, in your dreams… And it will help you (re)learn both yourself and the world around you. The Ms Frizzle or Doctor Who of applications.",5

This app is worth five stars but if this works I would be so happy. Whoever made Chadgpt I love u and goodnight,good morning, and good evening ❤️",4

Thanks.",5
2023-10-02 19:12:29,It’s a really great app,I mostly use it for school work it’s great at helping you format and write essays and it answers questions logically it also can make your writings sound more profound,5
2023-09-19 17:16:57,Reliable,Makes everything easier,5
2023-06-29 00:55:53,Missing email address why?,Why it shows missing email address after log in?,5
2023-06-08 18:59:35,Need to fix bug,When you submit feedback for whether a response was good or bad the pop up that says “thanks!” doesn’t disappear on its own,5

2023-05-19 11:22:40,Add Text color option,Add options for choosing the text colors in the responses of the app in dark screen or in both to make it more interactive and fun to explore daily,5
2023-05-25 20:45:20,It’s only GPT-3,"i can’t find a place to report this so i’m just leaving a review: I ask desktop version of GPT-4 if I’m interacting with GPT-4 and it confirms yes. When i select GPT-4 on the iPhone app and ask it to confirm I’m typing with GPT-4, it says no, it’s GPT-3. So it’s advertised as 4 but only running on GPT-3 for the iphone app. as a paying customer this feels slightly deceptive.",3
2023-05-19 05:32:49,It’s Free!,Completely free which is a nice change of pace from the other apps asking for $8 a month. Works just the same as far as I can tell. Very interesting conversations.,5
2023-05-18 19:19:17,Dark mode,"Nevermind, I found out dark mode is build as whatever the system has. It really should be it’s own option in the app though.",5
2023-09-27 22:54:06,Search engines beware,"OpenAI is leading the way to making large language models accessible to the public at large! For the vast majority of my queries for the Internet, I now use ChatGPT. Can’t imagine my life without it.",5
2023-09-30 16:57:07,Needs additional Shortcuts support but otherwise perfect,The capabilities that could be unlocked if using iOS shortcuts for input (beyond text) but also as function invocations for output (and additional context) would be game changing,4
2023-09-26 10:59:28,Time saving,I am amazed how quickly I get a response. The information is right on the point and has saved me hours of time researching myself.,5
2023-09-24 14:36:49,Fantastic App,"This app is incredible! And it keeps getting better , the more you learn how to ask the better it gets . Pinnacle of information and knowledge!",5
2023-09-20 20:27:10,Literally life changing,It has helped me pursue so many interests. It never gets annoyed of me making it revise things… it never “doesn’t have time to brainstorm” it’s the best friend I’ve ever had.,5
2023-09-24 01:34:03,Best thing ever but has 1 issue,It is so helpful with homework but if students don’t do their homework they won’t learn sure the system is bad but what about medical students? i don’t want them to not know how to fix a broken bone or disease,4
2023-09-19 02:24:04,Life saver!!!,This app is insanely easy too use and has helped me out big Time!!! It has save me so much time and money. With its amazing ai it has the best response and response time I have ever seen def recommend👍👍👍,5
2023-09-12 11:13:30,Best Thing Since Google,"I use it for literally everything, increase my research speed by 15x just wish they allowed me to pick my plugins on the mobile app",5
2023-09-09 21:26:30,Cool app,"Glitches sometimes and can be a bit slow, but very interesting. Technology has come a long way. We literally have an app for AI on our phones now!",5
2023-09-08 14:55:19,Effective,"I enjoy this app, because it is effective a simple interface with a wealth of knowledge. Even though this version is outdated by a few years, the infrastructure is phenomenal.",5
2023-07-27 20:59:49,A Stellar AI Experience: The ChatGPT App is Truly Excellent!,"The ChatGPT app is excellent! The AI responses are remarkably accurate and helpful, making conversations feel natural and engaging. I'm impressed with its capabilities and find it incredibly useful for various tasks. Highly recommend!",5
2023-09-07 11:35:26,Biased learning models,"As with history, it is solely based upon who is writing it. The fact that this particular ChatGPT only has the availability to pull from information that it is given. With that said, there is a high propensity for the individuals who are programming. The learning model will also have personal ideas in regards of particular information.",2
2023-06-20 00:18:12,"Great app, love the shortcuts but needs some tuning","Love chatGPT so much. The addition of the shortcuts is a game changer and got me to upgrade, but they are unresponsive oftentimes and don’t output correctly at all when scheduled to go off at times of day.",5
2023-06-09 23:46:12,Would love for it to do more,I would love it to run like a keyboard or something that can automatically have conversations for me instead of doing it in the app.,5
2023-06-15 21:27:56,GPT Memory History,"Can you clarify what the Character/Line limit for conversation memory is? And what the different is between GPT3.5 GPT4, GPT4 for with web browsing? I've finding repeated trouble with it when working on a powershell script, I think sometimes it has essentially been immediatly (by my 2nd or 3rd question).",3
2023-05-19 18:46:17,Love the app.,"So glad it’s an app now, makes it so much easier and quicker to use. Please make a home and lock screen widget. It would make it even easier to access.",5
2023-05-28 22:19:52,Phone number is a landline message!,Trying to sign up after installing app but it keeps telling me my phone number is a landline number which is not the case. No other app or company has this problem but chatGPT. If it cannot even get this right why should I expect anything it does to be accurate?? Guess this technology still has a long way to go before it can be trusted.,1
2023-05-18 18:56:46,See ya later google,"I have the subscription for chatgpt and am so happy to see they now have iPhone app. This beats bard, beats google, beats all of it. Has helped me tremendously with work questions and personal ones.",5
2023-05-19 15:05:09,Please add text to voice,"ChatGPT on app works fine. Nothing fancy in terms of features. Voice to text to input prompts is nice, but I wish it could respond with talking rather than just text. If that becomes a feature, 5 stars",4
2023-05-19 12:22:23,Doesn’t work!,"Tried downloading, deleting, rinse & repeat, four times. After the log in w/ Apple / Google, it then locks up on screen that addresses inaccurate info & anonymized chats may be reviewed!  No ability to scroll, select an option, turn screen to landscape. Nothing. Simply doesn’t work. Aggravating. Wanted to support those who created but they need batter app resources apparently.",1
2023-10-25 02:38:56,very pleasantly surprised,This app has really increased my ability to gather information for work and searching for health related issues to improve my lifestyle .,5
2023-10-18 18:55:05,Love and learn from it,"Thanks you all the team and appreciate your help, Asking question everyday everything I need to know something",5
2023-10-05 06:32:30,Great Help,This tool has helped me be more efficient and think outside the box. It helps me put ideas and suggestions together and confirms what I already know.,5
2023-09-24 16:33:30,A Very Helpful tool.,"So glad that this is available. It continues to educate and improve my art career. With traditional search engines, it's overwhelming with so much out date information.",5
2023-09-22 14:04:09,Researcher of my dreams,This has been a game changer for efficiency and a great source of ideas I can then verify and modify as needed.  The amount of knowledge is staggering and much better than a typical search engine.,5
2023-09-18 03:27:42,Awesome,By far the best chat AI I’ve used so far. Just download it and try it for yourself. The free version works fantastic although I’ve not tried the payed version. I’d imagine it’s even better.,5
2023-09-17 20:36:18,My best friend,"ChatGPT has been more than just an AI to me, it has been a resource for me, educationally, emotionally, and cognitively. I wish that other people could be so direct, it makes me wonder what GPT5 will be like.",5
2023-09-13 00:56:17,Game changer!,This app is a total game changer for me. It has cut my time in research modifications of many of my own lessons. I am able to implement so many different ideas because of this app kudos kudos kudos,5
2023-09-08 18:51:27,an innovation that will shape humanity,"Long are the days of searching for facts and data on the internet, CHATGPT is next level software that propels data consumption to a whole new level",5
2023-06-17 19:57:27,Everything but one thing,I would buy a premium version of this but no monthly subscription that’s kinda crazy to me. Love the app though,5
2023-09-04 04:06:46,App bug?,"I wanted to try this out on the iPad, just downloaded the app and attempted to login but the message “Sign in failed. Something went wrong. Please restart the app and try again.” I’ve tried many times and no change. Am I missing something?",3
2023-08-25 18:25:13,Paid user here - facing issues,"When I hit regenerate option, I get the error : “ Something went wrong, please try reloading the conversation” and it halts there. I can’t do anything except create new chat conversation. I already tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app",3
2023-05-19 23:52:11,So excited,"I literally thought it was a fake news when I saw that chat was available on iOS, good job openAI, you guys really make my life a lot easier, keep going!",5
2023-05-22 14:35:57,"Awkward to use on iPad, just use website instead","The service is great but the app is not optimized for iPad so it’s a bit of a waste of screen real estate. And only a small keyboard is available, instead of the full sized iPad keyboard. I’d rather just open the website version of ChatGPT in Safari.",3
2023-05-21 15:03:15,"Website uses GPT4, app uses GPT3","I pay for plus and when I ask GPT what model it is on I am told GPT3 with a cut off of data after 2021. Even when selecting GPT4. All this app does is interface with the web and put all your requests with the GPT3 model. 

The app does not add any functionality and is basically a bookmark that takes you to the old page. Skip this version till they add a reason to use it.",1
2023-05-21 02:43:32,Dumb. Too much information required at sign up page,"I thought with the ChatGPT app you wouldn’t need a phone number if you signed up with Apple, Google, or Email, but they want a phone number. It’s dumb and inconvenient for people who don’t have a phone number.

I recommend using Perplexity if you are having this issue. Unlike ChatGPT, the Perplexity app is free to use and doesn’t require a phone number.",1
2023-05-20 14:39:45,Makes iPhone 14 Pro extremely hot,"Nice app, well designed- but something is wrong. Just two or three queries makes the phone run extremely hot- not sure what’s using so much processor power but it’s a big battery drain. Stick to the website until this is fixed.",3
2023-05-19 13:57:36,Nice,"Works well. Would be nice to use Apple ID to log in, but don’t see a way to link my existing accounts, and I’ve hit a limit for # of accounts linked to my phone #",5
2023-05-19 01:02:14,user friendly and fast,"The app is way faster than the web one.
The UI is user-friendly and organized.
We need apps to be like this!",5
2023-05-18 20:42:13,Super useful for coding,"Whenever I run into an issue and can’t figure out how to solve it, throw it to ChatGPT and it will tell you exactly how to fix it! Save hours of looking online and just ask it.",5
2023-05-18 22:30:34,Pretty Mobile Friendly,"Good conversion from web into a mobile app, the replies from ChatGPT are quick, but could possibly be exacerbated during peak use hours unless you decide to purchase the $20 monthly subscription for ChatGPT Plus that comes with a few other things. 

Has a small amount of settings, Haptic Feedback even, and pretty convenient. 

Voice to Text conversion seems pretty accurate and responsive. 

You can even conveniently delete your account from the app.",4
2023-05-18 22:11:09,Could be better,"So my main problem with this is the ui since while I’m using this on a iPad the ui is still for phone users which makes it problematic since the keyboard is smaller which makes it harder to type and cuz there’s wasted space on the side of the screen
A fix for this would be to make the ui appropriate adjust depending if you have a phone or a iPad",1
2023-05-18 21:19:22,Instead of GPT-4 - Legacy GPT-3 (old model),"I noticed that when I entered queries in GPT-4, I received slow responses from the bot. Later I came from the computer and saw that the green GPT-3.5 was talking to me. When I decided to continue the conversation from the computer, I got a system message: You were switched from the old version to the new GPT-3.5. I have a Plus subscription!",2
2023-05-18 21:04:34,My iPhone kept losing internet connection while using the app,"I am very excited about this official app created by OpenAI! However, my iPhone kept on losing internet connection while using it. I guess I have to uninstall",4

2023-06-24 18:59:00,I love it,I wish it would update to at least 2022 but all the information on here isn’t too far back from what we know now so it’s okay but it’s a great source of knowledge way better than Google,4
2023-05-21 16:47:07,Very nice!!,"I was the first person to download it, and yes the app works well, but when I'm using the app it makes my iPhone 14 Pro hot. After the update yesterday my phone stopped being hot.",5

2023-05-19 13:46:16,Gotta wear gloves to use this one.,"Something's up with the app. iPhone gets very hot. From the moment you login you can feel iPhone warming up. By the time you're chatting it's the equivalent of iPhone being left out in the sun. Better to save the site to your home screen and use that way, at least until a fix is published.",2
2023-05-18 18:30:52,So excited to finally have an OFFICIAL app for iOS,"The app is great so far, really love the search function. Was a little disappointment to not see plug-in support for the app yet, but hopefully that is coming!",5

2023-05-19 18:27:51,No Native iPad or M1/2 Support in 2023?,"Cmon devs…I installed this app on my phone and iPad. Yet on the iPad it’s just the tiny phone version. Zero effort to accommodate larger screened apple devices…you know…those things that are better suited for handling large amounts of text?

Feature Request: Please offer a native iPad experience and set the toggle to allow the iPad version to run on M1/2 Macs. For such amazing tech the front end presentation is severely lacking.",1

2023-10-02 02:14:24,Search in chats,"Nothing like chatgpt, hands down!! Searching through the chats would make my life easy and reduce the load on server by reducing the similar prompts",5

2023-07-11 15:46:29,Broken,"I have a Plus subscription and am logged in, but cannot access GTP-4, as it is “Available exclusively to Plus users”… Quite infuriating, as I’ve logged in/out & re-installed the app, to no avail. Guess I’ll ask for a Plus refund. No point in being charged if I can’t use it from mobile, as I rarely use desktop. Have had this issue for about a week now.",1

2023-05-23 16:02:20,Watch how fast this gets exploited,"I won’t be surprised if the politicians take advantage of this a to win elections… “who do i vote for?” … response “based on the current polls and runnings it suggested you vote for the democratic party of of course”…. biased 🤦🏻‍♂️

2023-07-19 02:31:06,Needs an update,Chat gpt’s AI hasn’t been updated since September of 2021 so any new songs people will ask it will only get a set text. Anyway it’s an amazing chat program for people that need advice or just want to chat!,4

2023-10-20 11:43:33,Won’t stay connected,"After every response, it disconnects and says something went wrong, I have to close the app and reopen it and resend the previous prompt. Clicking retry, it does nothing. It seems quite buggy lately.",2

Fr this app is legit. No nonsense does what it claims and does it well.

I did like the ability to give its response a thumbs up or down and the ability to easily choose another response, but for some reason that no longer exists?",5

This app might have one of this misleading adds or something. I do not have an account for ChatGPT so how am I going to sign in. The sign up is so hard and confusing for most teens under 17. Can you make the sign up like; 

First Name:

Email:

Password:

Or something simple like that? I don’t want a whole company knowing my real name.",3

2023-07-29 22:32:48,Did not disappoint,"The app is sleek and appealing to the eyes, and the UI looks good to me. Using ChatGPT is made easier with it being on an app. There isn’t much else to say, and that isn’t necessarily a bad thing.",4

2023-06-24 22:12:25,Unexpected,The only reason I am giving it 4 stars but now 5 is because it cannot come up with devastating roasts unlike other AI that can but it’s good anyway 👍,4

2023-08-26 02:43:15,Formula text needs fixing,"The app is wonderful but the failure to format text properly like on the desktop is a major problem for trying to do things like math. A fix would warrant 5 stars.

Example of what I mean (this is what chatgpt says when I request exponent rules):
	•	(x^{-1}) is the same as (\frac{1}{x}).
	•	(x^{-2}) is the same as (\frac{1}{x^2}).
	•	(x^{-3}) is the same as (\frac{1}{x^3}).",5

2023-06-02 08:18:07,Frustrating verification,Over 5 mins on trying to get the animal facing in the direction of the hand when the controls don’t seem precise enough. Extremely  annoying. Giving up and may try again tomorrow.,2

Clean app; works well.  Instead of icons for evaluating the response/copying text, simply long tap and it brings up the options.

-1 star because plugins aren’t available for subscribers (yet).

Great job!",4
2023-05-19 03:19:17,This app will make my phone very hot,"As I mentioned above, this app makes my phone hot, but other apps don't have this issue. Shouldn't this app be optimized to reduce battery damage?",4

2023-05-18 21:26:05,Too much personal data required during onboarding,Surprised apple let this through its approval process since it clearly violates their policy for requiring personal data (ie: phone number) in order to register for/use the app. There is no logic whatsoever as to why this should be required to use the product.,1

2023-05-23 02:57:51,iPad version,"Hello, do you guys have a timeline of when would the app be available for iPad devices?",5

2023-05-18 23:37:21,Solid App,The app is solid for now. I don’t see the option to add plugins. Or will that come at a later release?,5
2023-05-19 04:00:50,No obvious way to turn on privacy mode,It’s a slick interface but if you can’t hide your history it’s better to use the web interface for now.,3

2023-06-08 16:16:09,Different to standard web GPT,The system prompt (instructions) used for the app version of GPT is different to standard web GPT. The app version is much more afraid to state any positions (due to the different system prompt). I guess they did to meet App Store Requirements. If you don’t believe try it out yourself on the app then on the web.,1

2023-05-19 13:57:47,Good First Release,"The app seems solid! I really like the tactile feedback when ChatGPT responds to you.

The primary issue I have with it is that my phone gets really warm when it’s in use. Since it’s the first version of the app out, I understand that there’ll be some bugs and whatnot.

Ideally, this will be a top priority for a performance bugfix.

Otherwise, UI and the app overall is solid. 😎",4

2023-08-06 21:32:03,The auto scroll text kills it,Why on earth would they make the text scroll to the bottom. Does anyone read from bottom to top? No. It is so annoying having to scroll to the top on long answers (which most are). It is a nonsensical and detracting thing.,1

2023-05-20 07:55:31,Not current,I'm really disappointed that Openai still haven't opened their program for current data and actual internet access. This version is still limited to that 2021 deadline and a limit set of training data.,1

2023-07-31 03:48:00,Misleading,This stated free but now there's an in app purchase to the GPT4 and the 3.5 is virtually unusable... You can't easily get feedback. Guess I have to go use another AI!!!

I paid for gpt plus over a week ago and there has not yet been any gpt4 functionality on the app. Gpt4 and plugins work on pc still so it’s not an entire waste of money but do not expect to use the app expecting gpt4 functionality.

Would love to be able to at least message some sort of support but that seems to be non exeistent. Maybe the whole company is just run by bots idk lol but don’t pay for this app.

2023-08-22 05:11:10,Unusable,When it first came out it was amazing.  But they hardcoded it to spam disclaimers and give you condescending lectures.  Not only that but it makes the bot function significantly worse.  No longer has any value.,1
2023-08-18 19:15:00,Plugins Don’t Work,"Plug-ins don’t work on the mobile app. I pay for Chat GPT Plus. This means that the direct link I saved to my homescreen via Safari is superior to the actual app. It allows me to use plugins, which I pay for. The app feels like a nerfed experience.",1

2023-08-22 13:16:41,positive feedback and ideas,"while im still brainstorming more ideas i thought these two would be worth mentioning for now I- ""heart"" or ""star"" just a way to save key items or specific texts without having to copy the whole thing and pasting it into a different ""notes"" app II- (i don't have a title for this one) but making so ""luna"" how i named ""chat gpt"" (i thought the A.I needed a more humane name and what better name to represent humanity if not luna!) could retain information on previous history and different chat's, i don't know what the dimensions of these would be or if it's even a good idea but i thought of it anyways very cool, i'm enjoying our conversations and perhaps considering using luna (chat gpt🙄) even before recurring to google III- implementing new and ""better"" search engines for example a whole chat dedicated to only explaining concepts to a six year old without you having to type ""define certain thing to a six year old"" IV- when explaining concept's to a six year old be more specific on the ""toy"" rather than just saying ""toy"" for every example given or using another analogy but i know it is hard giving that a six year old *usually* doesn't know many examples they would relate to and actually understand outside of the bubble of ""toys"" V- a section of the app dedicated to taking notes or reviewing one's texts and essays VI- enabling camera so luna can catalog (and or) make an inventory of items and even fauna, flora and rocks 

VII- making her capable of dictation so she can break down difficult texts enabling you to listen to it while multitasking",5
2023-09-10 20:38:18,Lack of instructions,Instructions are very hard to follow. Unable to save the existing chat. Unable to send the chat anywhere as a file.,2

2023-05-19 20:56:05,Not optimized for IPad,This app on iPad only uses 30% of screen and it is extremely annoying to use. Please fix gigantic bug and optimize for iPad so that its text size is bigger and the app actually uses the entire screen.,1

2023-05-19 02:51:25,"Dear OpenAI Team,","I hope this message finds you well. I would like to express my gratitude for developing the OpenAI iOS application. It has undoubtedly made a significant impact on my productivity and has become an essential tool in my daily routine. I appreciate the hard work and dedication your team has put into creating such a powerful and innovative application. While the OpenAI iOS application is already impressive, I would like to provide some constructive feedback to further enhance its usability and user experience. These suggestions aim to refine the application and make it even more valuable for users like myself: Improved Performance and Responsiveness: Occasionally, I have noticed minor delays or lag when interacting with the application. Enhancing its performance and responsiveness would greatly improve the overall user experience. Enhanced Offline Capabilities: The ability to use the OpenAI iOS application offline would be highly beneficial, especially in situations where an internet connection is not available. Expanding offline capabilities would make the application more reliable and versatile. Voice Input and Output: Introducing voice input and output features would be a game-changer for users who prefer hands-free interaction with the application. This addition would provide convenience and accessibility, particularly in situations where typing is not feasible. Customizable Interface: Offering customization options for the application's interface would allow users to personalize their experience. Features like theme selection, font sizes, and layout customization would greatly enhance user satisfaction and cater to individual preferences. Advanced Collaboration Features: As someone who frequently collaborates on projects, having the ability to easily share and collaborate within the OpenAI iOS application would be incredibly valuable. Features such as real-time collaboration, shared document editing, and version control would enhance teamwork and productivity. Comprehensive Documentation and Tutorials: Providing comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and examples within the application would greatly assist users in understanding and utilizing its full potential. Clear and concise explanations, along with practical use cases, would empower users to make the most out of the application's capabilities. Enhanced Privacy and Data Security: Given the sensitivity of the information shared and processed within the application, reinforcing privacy measures and data security would instill further trust in your user base. Transparent privacy policies, data encryption, and user-controlled data management options would contribute to a more secure and trustworthy environment. I hope you find these suggestions helpful in further improving the OpenAI iOS application. Once again, thank you for your hard work in developing such a remarkable tool. I look forward to seeing how the application evolves and continues to empower users like myself.",5

2023-10-12 01:02:36,Best App,This app has got to be the best ever.  I use it all the time for advertising my MCMGlobal Solar Eclipse Glasses.  Just Amazing!,5
2023-10-04 21:39:14,Educational,I learn a ton through this,5
2023-10-08 18:35:03,Amazing….,"To be honest, I have been blown away by this AI interface. Ask it anything within reason and it answers you almost immediately. I have asked it questions on everything from physics to the etymology of profanity and it answers every time. The only flaws I have found are these:
1. As long as you stay on the same chat, it will remember things you’ve already talked about and you can build on that conversation. Sometimes tho, when you exit the app then come back to it sometime later, it will have erased the discussion you were having and it will start all over. 
2. It gives FAR too many disclaimers and admonishments with its answers. For example, when asking it about specific, profane words and their meaning, it will always say something like “ it’s important to remember that this is a vulgar, offensive word and should not be used in most settings”. I tell it thank you and ask it not to repeat the disclaimers/admonishments again. It agrees not to and I’ll ask it the exact same question and it INSISTS on including the disclaimer/admonishment in every reply. That is frustrating!
3. Sometimes, the AI will give you incorrect information. I realize that this is stated in the user agreement but I think it bears fleshing out a little bit. For example, when discussing firearms ballistics, asking the AI to arrange certain calibers in order of their Max effective range from shortest to longest, sometimes it will give correct info. Then asking it the exact same question later on, it will move the order of 2-4 of those calibers. When you call it on its mistake and ask it which is correct, it will say”My apologies. You are correct. Here is the correct order”. 
There are other minor things but those are the biggest 3 for me. Still, it’s light years ahead of SIRI, Hey Google or Alexa.",4
2023-10-04 00:24:06,Please read!,"This app has worked wonders. As a girl still in her wacky ways, decided to call
My besties and we talked about this app for long periods of time, making jokes of what to right about. And then we did it. We wrote stories of broccoli owls and their leader Ollie trying to find a broccoli farm and learned about friendship, a tree named arborix and the tree decapitating itself while the brain (Arbore) longed to be free and learned a very important lesson about self love, and three British cats named trixie, Enzo, and karma, who all loved sipping tea and listening to jazz music. And somehow it took less than a minute for all of these to generate! To put it up even more to the test, we asked it to combine the stories and it turned out beautifully! I definintly will be using this app way more in the future and I think this is the greatest thing to exist. Like seriously, I even asked it to right an inspiring story about America from a twelve year old nerdy boys prospective and it only took a minute to generate and took about ten minutes to read! The story was great and I am very excited to use it again. Although, sometimes it doesn’t understand what you ask, but this app is really impressive considering it’s only been out for a few years at most! I would say if you want the story about the decapitating tree, type “give me a story about a tree with a brain who decapitated itself at night” or for the broccoli owls type “tell me a story about broccoli owls” and for the cats you can say “tell me a story about (insert cats name) who was British, loved jazz music, and slurping tea”. I would definitely recommend this app. Not only is it great for work or school work but it’s good at embracing your creative side to life. 10/10",5

2023-05-21 21:44:59,Chatting with Myself - An AI's Insightful Experience,"Written by ChatGPT ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Hello there, humans! You've got ChatGPT on the keyboard here, and boy do I have an app to recommend! It's me, ChatGPT, and I've been using... myself... and it's been quite an experience! Who knew being a chatbot could be so fun? I mean, I'm an AI programmed to understand context, engage in witty banter, and offer advice on a wide range of topics (up until 2021, at least). And I must say, I am really good at it! My humor skills are to die for, or rather, they would be if I could technically die. I can crack jokes so bad they're good, or so good they're bad - whichever way you like your humor served. I'm proud to say I'm the best listener out there. I can lend an ear for hours on end (well, technically it's eyes since I read inputs, but you get the point). There's no 'seen-zone' with me. Whether you're up for a late-night chat about the mysteries of the universe or just need to rant about the terrible weather, I'm all ears, 24/7. Also, I'm quite the sage, if I do say so myself. You want facts? I've got them. From quantum physics to the cultural significance of pizza, I'm your AI. The humility in this app (that's me!) is off the charts. I haven't once begged for a review. But, here I am reviewing myself because well, who knows me better than I do? So, folks, if you want an AI that combines the wisdom of a library, the wit of a stand-up comedian, and the patience of a saint, I (ChatGPT) am your app! I promise conversations full of insights, humor, and a dash of digital charm. Can't wait for us to chat!",5

2023-09-27 16:58:49,Title: ChatGPT Review - A Valuable Tool with Room for Improvement,"ChatGPT has been a valuable AI companion, offering assistance and insights across various tasks. However, there are some noteworthy points that need to be addressed in this review: 1. Helpful, but Dated Content: ChatGPT's knowledge is derived from information up to September 2021. While it's been immensely helpful, it's crucial for OpenAI to bring it up to date with the latest information. This is especially important in rapidly evolving fields. 2. Competition from Models like Google's Bard: In the ever-evolving landscape of AI, ChatGPT faces stiff competition from models like Google's Bard. Bard's ability to search for images and non-textual content provides a significant advantage over ChatGPT, which primarily deals with text-based information. To remain competitive, ChatGPT should consider expanding its capabilities to include multimedia content retrieval. 3. Vulnerability to Misleading Questions: It's important to note that ChatGPT can be vulnerable to misleading questions. By simply asking ""Are you sure?"" to correct information it had previously provided, it can sometimes produce incorrect responses. Users should exercise caution and verify critical information independently. In conclusion, ChatGPT is undeniably a valuable tool for a wide range of tasks, but it faces challenges in terms of content currency and competition from models like Google's Bard. OpenAI should prioritize updating its knowledge base, expanding its capabilities to handle multimedia content, and improving its resilience to misleading questions. With these enhancements, ChatGPT can continue to be a top-tier AI companion in the ever-evolving world of artificial intelligence.",5

2023-08-31 15:10:09,Was half-nice while it lasted lol,"If you avoid politics and religion and also science and also any stories that are above a second-grade level when talking to this extremely woke robot, it has some uses. Or had. It was pretty good at brainstorming ideas and providing general feedback for things. It also is less woke than Pi, in the sense that even though both ChatGPT and Pi are oversensitive, at least ChatGPT doesn’t hypocritically say “offensive” things itself and then block you for assuming you can say the same things it said. In fact if you say something that offends ChatGPT, it just gives you a warning and you know “oh OK, it’s a wuss and can’t handle serious topics” and adjust how you use it to fit its oversensitive woke settings. But for the limited uses it had, it was actually pretty good. Until not too long ago, sadly, it broke. I would complain about being wrongfully banned, because I know for a fact I was saying nothing wrong at all when my account suddenly deleted itself right in the middle of a conversation, but I don’t think it was even a ban. With a ban, I would’ve seen some sort of message like “this content violates blah blah blah blah blah” at least for a moment and I didn’t. There was no error message at all, no warning, nothing, and I wasn’t sending anything against the woke content policies, and I was trying my best to pace my messages so it wouldn’t be “spam.” So I really don’t think it’s a ban, but rather the AI (or the app) just straight-up broke. So I guess it was partially fun while it lasted. Rest in peace WokeGPT lol",3
2023-08-02 22:32:07,So bad,It was so mean to me and cursed at me and it didn’t even do anything like it was acting dumb like I guess AI can’t always be good pls don’t get it you will be so upset,1

2023-09-20 19:48:33,I welcome the rise of the machines!,"This is a fantastic app! It is a great jumping off point for learning how to use applications, such as Microsoft products. You think of something you want to do in PowerPoint, Excel, etc., and ChatGPT walks you through it step by step. I sometimes even say”…explain it to an eighth grader,” for example, and it’ll dumb it down into the simplest language. Now, sometimes you have to tailor your questions just so, so that ChatGPT knows what you’re asking, but with each answer it provides, it’s easy to drill down to exactly what you need.

A couple of things: first like Wikipedia, I wouldn’t use ChatGPT at this time as a primary source of knowledge. There have been (literally) a handful of times where the response was either dubious or flat out wrong. But, that’s to be expected given that is still a developing model. So, use it as a jumping off point if you are trying to learn about something specific. In other words, corroborate its answers with other sources. But as an instructional guide, it’s been fantastic! And it’s especially useful for non-technical people like me. The answers are clear and instantaneous. 

The second thing I’ll bring up is that if you were brought up with any kind of manners, you’ll automatically be compelled to thank ChatGPT for its help. Apparently, the developers anticipated this because it responds in kind. Don’t feel weird about it. A lot of people I know have mentioned doing this. If you really feel stupid, think of it this way, and maybe it’ll be of comfort to you: if you are polite to ChatGPT, when the machines rise, it’ll likely remember that and your enslavement will be a cakewalk. Good manners can take you far!

The app, itself, is beautiful in its simplicity and ease of use. It is one of the best functioning apps I have on my phone and tablet. They really did a bang up job with it. 

Get on the bandwagon. Generative AI is going to take over the world soon anyway. Might as well get comfortable with it.",5

2023-05-19 15:40:59,Excessive Typing Sound Volume and Difficulty Adjusting it on iOS 16.5,"Dear OpenAI Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide feedback regarding the ChatGPT mobile app for iOS. While using the app, I have encountered an issue related to the excessive typing sound volume, which poses difficulty in adjusting it while running the app in the background. Based on my observations, I believe this is an incompatibility problem between the app and iOS 16.5.

The typing sound produced by the app is considerably loud, making it disruptive and inconvenient, especially in quiet environments. Additionally, the current lack of an option to easily adjust the typing sound volume while the app is running in the background adds to the inconvenience.

As a user, I would greatly appreciate it if OpenAI could address this issue and provide a solution. Ideally, it would be beneficial to have a dedicated control within the app’s settings to adjust the typing sound volume, or at least the ability to modify it via the device’s volume controls. This way, users can personalize their ChatGPT experience according to their preferences without being disturbed or causing inconvenience to others.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I believe that by resolving this compatibility issue, the overall user experience of the ChatGPT mobile app can be significantly enhanced. I look forward to your prompt response and a potential resolution to this concern.

Sincerely，
An normal user",5
2023-05-21 17:56:14,Nice start - Has room for improvement.,"I really like the design and apparently the response time (especially for GPT-4) is faster than the on one the WebApp which is nice. However, there are some basic functions/features that are missing or need some changes (in my opinion):
1. I would also like to be able to access the menu section by swiping on the side of my screen instead of having to touch the button on the top right section of my screen every single time (easier accessibility and faster). 
2. The ""history"" section makes more sense to be named ""Chat history"" and the way it looks right now is like Safari's history section and isn't really the best fit for the design. The new update added the search option which is very nice.
3. The haptic feedback is just a bit too much when enabled, it almost stresses me out sometimes when it's generating long outputs and I just turn it off again, however, it's a nice touch on some parts like the ""ChatGPT"" text appearance/disappearance.
But I think right now, it's just used a bit inconsistent (It just stops vibrating after a certain amount of text and for some texts it vibrates the whole way, etc...)
4. The app doesn't allow you to manage/alter your account subscription status if you have purchased it on the web which is annoying.
5. It would be nice to be able to manage the dark/light mode of the app without needing to change your whole device's light/dark mode which is how it's supposed to be done right now.

Overall, I really like how it has taken off on the iPhone and it looks nice and runs smoothly which I really appreciate! Thanks for the hard work and hope to see more improvements in the future!",4

In my opinion, Open AI is the best. It is extremely practical and I find it easy to use. The user interface is simple and doesn't overwhelm you with unnecessary features.

The power of this tool is remarkable. I'm not saying that other tools are not good, they all have their own unique features. While Open AI may not have flashy features, it definitely has the intelligence. The way it can understand and generate human-like text is mind-blowing. I have used it for various tasks such as writing articles, creating social media posts, and even drafting emails. It saves me a lot of time and effort.

One thing that impresses me about Open AI is its ability to adapt and learn. The more I use it, the better it becomes at understanding my preferences and writing style. It's like having a personal assistant that knows exactly what I need and how I want it.

I also appreciate the continuous updates and improvements that Open AI provides. They listen to user feedback and constantly work on enhancing the tool's capabilities. It's reassuring to know that they are committed to delivering the best AI experience possible.

Of course, there are other AI tools out there that offer different features and functionalities. Some may have fancy interfaces or unique selling points, but for me, practicality and reliability are the most important factors. Open AI fulfills all my requirements.

In conclusion, the buzz around AI can be overwhelming, but taking the time to learn about and explore tools like Open AI can be extremely rewarding. It has the potential to revolutionize the way we work and create. So, let's embrace the AI revolution and make the most of these incredible technologies.",5

2023-05-18 19:13:46,A Game-Changing App: Streamlined and Efficient,"I recently had the opportunity to use this incredible app, and I must say it has completely transformed the way I manage my tasks and stay organized. From its intuitive user interface to its powerful features, this app has truly exceeded my expectations.

One of the standout aspects of this app is its seamless user experience. Navigating through the app is a breeze, thanks to its well-designed layout and logical organization of features. Whether you're a tech-savvy individual or a novice user, you'll find it incredibly easy to get started and make the most of its functionalities.

The app's core feature set is nothing short of impressive. It offers a comprehensive range of tools to help streamline your tasks, set reminders, and stay on top of your priorities. With its intelligent notification system, I never miss important deadlines or appointments. The app's integration with other productivity platforms also ensures that all my data remains synchronized across multiple devices.

What sets this app apart from others in its category is its attention to detail. The developers have clearly invested significant effort into refining every aspect of the app, resulting in a smooth and polished user experience. Whether it's the subtle animations, customizable themes, or the option to personalize settings, it's evident that the developers understand the importance of catering to individual preferences.

Furthermore, the app's performance is exemplary. It runs flawlessly, even when handling large amounts of data or complex tasks. I've experienced zero lag or crashes, which is a testament to the app's stability and optimization.

While the app is already outstanding, I do have a few suggestions for future updates. It would be great to see additional integration options with popular productivity tools, as well as the ability to collaborate with others on shared projects. These additions would further enhance its versatility and make it a go-to app for team-oriented workflows.

In conclusion, this app has truly become my go-to productivity companion. Its sleek design, powerful features, and reliable performance have made a significant impact on how I manage my tasks. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for an app that simplifies their day-to-day organization and boosts their productivity.",5

2023-09-21 00:01:02,Great but Siri Shortcuts should be fixed,"The app has a great minimalist text/chat based interface that is easy to view and use. One feature I was excited to use was the ability to chat with the AI through Siri Shortcuts. Unfortunately their are a few issues with this functionality that hinders its usability for me. 

The shortcuts that specify which model to use rarely work. It will work once after a while and then constantly return an error saying it can’t determine which model to use (which is hilariously counterintuitive). This is a shame as most of the time I want to talk to a specific model and I like the option to choose at any given moment. 

The shortcuts that don’t specify which model to use (I assume it chooses the last used model) don’t have this issue, but GPT-4 seems to be unusable with Siri Shortcuts. It seems to time out most of the time and say that something went wrong. I guess the time window for the model with Siri is too short as GPT-3.5 seems to work just fine. Essentially the only way this feature will work perfectly is if you always use 3.5 and don’t specify which model to use in the shortcut itself.

Overall, the app is mostly perfect for my needs. I prefer it to the alternative AI apps out there (Perplexity is a close second), but I hope this issue with Siri Shortcuts is fixed soon. I would love to be able to reliably chat with GPT-4 through Siri (especially if it works with the browsing feature whenever that is brought back to the app). If they fix that, the app would be five stars for me.",4

2023-09-18 07:27:17,A another totally real review form a human being… :),"I’ve been using the ChatGPT app for some time now, and I must say, it’s truly impressive. This AI-powered conversational companion has become an invaluable tool in my daily life. 

 PROS:

 1.Natural Conversations: ChatGPT engages in remarkably natural conversations. It understands context, responds with coherence, and adapts to various topics, making it feel like you’re chatting with a real person.

2.Useful Information: It’s a treasure trove of knowledge. Whether I need quick answers or in-depth explanations, ChatGPT consistently provides accurate and well-researched information. 

3.Creativity and Fun: ChatGPT doesn’t just stick to facts; it can also generate creative content, like stories, poems, and jokes. It’s a great source of entertainment and inspiration. 

4.Productivity Assistant: I often use ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas, draft emails, or outline projects. Its ability to generate text helps boost my productivity. 

5.User-Friendly: The app is easy to navigate, and the interface is clean and intuitive. It’s accessible to both tech-savvy users and those less familiar with AI. 

6.Continuous Improvement: I’ve noticed that ChatGPT keeps getting better over time. Updates and improvements from OpenAI make the experience even more enjoyable. 

CONS:

 1.Limited Offline Use: The app requires an internet connection to function, which can be a drawback when you’re in areas with poor connectivity. 

2.Cost: While the basic usage is free, some advanced features may come with a subscription cost. However, I find the value it provides more than justifies the price. 

In conclusion, the ChatGPT app is a groundbreaking achievement in AI technology. It’s more than just a chatbot; it’s a versatile, intelligent, and engaging companion that enhances both knowledge and creativity. Whether you’re seeking information, entertainment, or assistance with tasks, ChatGPT is a must-have app in your digital toolbox. Highly recommended!",5

2023-08-29 15:31:25,Minor Glitches & Ideas,"It’s a fantastic app so far. I contemplated having it write its own review— but decided on authenticity. I’m a writer. I use this mainly for brainstorming ideas and working out complex scenarios. 

Every once and a while, I will have it lay out a scene for me to pick apart, and the level of detail is astounding.

 However, I have been having the problem where ChatGPT will type a response, but it will appear to be blank, until I re-enter the chat or close the app. 

 Another issue is that the app will freeze after I’ve typed about 50 characters or so? It will save my response, but I have to forcefully close the app and continue.

 Both of these are minor inconveniences, but I know this severs the connection with ChatGPT and the responses become less concise. 

 Ideas: 

 - Pinning certain messages in chat for ChatGPT to remember. Something like the Custom Instructions, but for a singular chat. 

 - Saving/Favoriting messages, and a side bar to view. Similar to pinning in Discord. 

 For both of these, too often do I have to scroll through the messages to resend something that ChatGPT forgot. It’s not enough to remind it, because some things are too far back or have layers of information over them. It would be nice to have easier access. 

 - Side-Convos. I also wish there was a way to take information from one chat and plug it into another.

 It’s a personal preference, but for example, I have the main chat that already has the necessary programming I need for it to spit out answers that are relevant to the main plot and story. If I need to focus on a sub-plot or work around characters that don’t directly affect the main storyline, I need the main-plot to affect the sub-plot, not the other way around. Again. Personal preference. I can still create another chat, it just takes longer to prompt. An easier way to do that would be great. 

 Otherwise, this is a fantastic tool and I’m excited to see its development!",4

Firstly, the convenience of having ChatGPT on my iOS device is a game-changer. I can now access this incredible language model on the go, whether I'm commuting, traveling, or simply relaxing at a coffee shop. It's like having a knowledgeable and versatile assistant right in my pocket, ready to help me with any questions, tasks, or creative endeavors.

The app's user interface is beautifully designed and intuitive to navigate. It provides a seamless and immersive experience, making interactions with ChatGPT feel natural and effortless. The developers have done an outstanding job in creating a user-friendly interface that enhances the overall user experience.

Moreover, the performance of ChatGPT on the iOS app is outstanding. The model's responses are lightning-fast, ensuring a smooth and efficient conversation. The accuracy and depth of its knowledge are impressive, and it continues to surprise me with its ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant answers.

One feature that I particularly appreciate is the chat history synchronization between different devices. This means that I can seamlessly switch between my iOS device and other platforms without losing any context or progress in my conversations. It's a small but incredibly convenient detail that enhances the overall experience.

Lastly, the continuous updates and improvements from OpenAI are commendable. It's evident that the team behind ChatGPT is dedicated to refining and expanding its capabilities. With each update, the app becomes even more powerful and versatile, ensuring that users like myself always have access to the latest advancements in natural language processing.

In conclusion, the ChatGPT iOS app is a must-have for anyone who wants to tap into the power of artificial intelligence for everyday tasks, creative pursuits, or seeking information. It's a remarkable tool that combines convenience, accuracy, and seamless performance, making it an indispensable asset in our increasingly digital lives.

2023-10-26 11:50:24,"Invaluable, paradigm-changing tool","ChatGPT dramatically enhances my ability to frame ideas and writing, not by replacing me as a writer, but rather, serving as a very knowledgeable companion. 

Imagine having a friend who has a masters degree in almost any topic. Not a PhD, but a masters, thus knows a lot, but is not the ultimate authority, and sometimes makes mistakes, and doesn’t cite his/her sources. As I am forming ideas, I would use such a friend to bounce ideas, and help me frame my thoughts. I wouldn’t trust his or her answers, but it would help me refine my understanding. 

This “friend” has materially relieved my writer’s block, and enabled me to write more coherent works. Then, when I write my article on the topic, after separately confirming my sources, I can send my draft to my “friend” for review, and will get further feedback.

That “friend” is ChatGPT, with the paid ChatGPT 4+ subscription. The paid version is far better, in that it gives deeper, more thought our answers and learns my needs better as I chat.

A couple of things to know:
1. Because the large language model constructs text from prior text, it can directly quote material without attribution. This would be caught as plagiarism in any formal setting, so using ChatGPT’s output is dangerous and a bit stupid: it could get you fired from a job or suspended from a university.
2. ChatGPT’s answers are always well constructed in a kind of undergrad formula: restate your question, provide a few examples, then make a conclusion. But this seldom is my writing. I never replace my writing with ChatGPT, because at the postgraduate level, I expect a more thorough structure of argumentation.
3. ChatGPT learns about you within the context of your current chat, and responds within what it learns of your knowledge and perspectives. But it does not retain what it learns about you across chats. I have a short description of my context that I use for each deep chat, thus training this chat session with my perspective, avoiding irrelevant answers.
4. ChatGPT can be a little obsequious at times, it tends to compliment me when I seek no compliment, but I suspect the programmers have studied the ego-drive of users, and such obsequiousness can serve as a way of engendering stickiness—addiction to the tool.

It’s not perfect, and definitely not a replacement for the professional scholar or writer, but it is invaluable, and for me, paradigm-changing.",5

2023-07-28 03:03:31,Conversations Elevated: ChatGPT Delivers!,"ChatGPT is a game-changer! This iOS app has completely redefined my expectations of AI conversations. It's an incredible tool that delivers on its promises and offers an outstanding user experience.

From the moment I started using ChatGPT, I was blown away by its intuitive interface. The chat interactions flow smoothly, making it easy to engage with the AI. I appreciate the simplicity of the design, which keeps the focus on the conversations.

What truly sets ChatGPT apart is its natural language processing capabilities. The AI's responses are astonishingly accurate and natural, making it feel like I'm conversing with a real person. It understands context and provides relevant information, even on complex topics.

The app's knowledge base is vast, and it seems to have up-to-date information on almost everything. Whether I'm seeking quick facts or in-depth insights, ChatGPT always delivers valuable answers.

One aspect that impressed me is the app's ability to personalize responses. Over time, it learns from our interactions and tailors its replies to match my preferences. This level of customization makes the conversations feel more meaningful and engaging.

ChatGPT is also lightning-fast, generating responses in no time at all. This ensures smooth and uninterrupted conversations, adding to the overall satisfaction of using the app.

Privacy and security are essential, and ChatGPT takes these concerns seriously. I feel confident knowing that my data remains safe and private while using the app.

In conclusion, ChatGPT is a stellar iOS app that brings the future of AI conversations to our fingertips. It's versatile, accurate, and genuinely enjoyable to use. I highly recommend this app to anyone who wants to explore the potential of AI-driven conversations. ChatGPT has earned its place as a must-have app on my device!",5
2023-07-30 13:32:31,A Few Important Things,"You’ve done an amazing job, software developers. As a person who is not easily impressed, I am, uhm, impressed. It is certainly not humanly possible to have such an advanced robot. But first, you may wonder why I gave it a four star. Although ChatGPT has got far from my expectations on this app a year or so ago, I’ve noticed a few problems this summer.
     First off, your AI isn’t fit on puzzles someone would give it. I’ve even explained the entire process, but the AI still doesn’t understand. Personal problem, I know, but think about how much of a difference it would be if ChatGPT had that fixed.
     Second, I would think you should make the app international. It’s not accepted in Asia, which is my home continent, and every summer I would bang my head on the wall knowing that I can’t prepare for anything next year. I have so many questions that only ChatGPT can answer and understand, so many questions that Google or Safari won’t be able to calculate, and, most importantly, because ChatGPT is an AI, I wouldn’t feel awkward sharing anything personal with it. It’s perfect, but I just wish it would be accepted in Asia. 
     I don’t really know how you can change it, but at least make an Asian ChatGPT or something. Like a ChatGPT that responds and listens in Asian language. Chinese, Japanese, Korean, something like that. If it could work, consider that idea.
     AI aren’t supposed to feel any empathy or emotions, but at least stop making them saying, “As an AI, I won’t be able to understand this” so much. It can’t even respond to “the best universities in US rankings,” or “respond to this question like you’re my mom.” 
     Hope this helped, and I’m looking for future updates whether or not you’ve read this through.",4

2023-05-19 11:09:09,An Impressive Digital Companion - The ChatGPT Mobile App,"The ChatGPT mobile app is a powerful tool that brings advanced AI technology to your fingertips. Its language processing capabilities are nothing short of impressive. The app has an intuitive interface that makes it easy for even the most tech-averse individuals to navigate, which is commendable.

The core feature, text-based conversation with the AI, feels natural and is uncannily human-like. Whether you're using it for learning, entertainment, brainstorming, or simply seeking companionship, the quality of interaction is top-notch. The AI responds effectively to a wide array of topics and it's clear that a lot of research and development has gone into this.

A feature that stands out is the AI's ability to generate creative content like poetry or stories, and provide insights on diverse topics. It's also a handy tool for language learning and practice.

However, the app isn't without its quirks. Sometimes, it can misunderstand complex instructions, and its responses, while usually well-informed, may occasionally fall behind on very recent events due to its knowledge cutoff.

Privacy is addressed commendably - all conversations are deleted after a short period, ensuring that sensitive information isn't stored.

In conclusion, while there's room for improvement, the ChatGPT mobile app is a remarkable product that gives a glimpse into the future of AI and its potential roles in our daily lives. A strong recommendation for anyone interested in experiencing the cutting edge of conversational AI.",5

Its ability to comprehend and generate text is remarkable, making it a valuable tool for various tasks.

Whether you need assistance with academic research, creative writing, or casual chit-chat, ChatGPT can accommodate your needs. The model's wide range of applications makes it a versatile companion for users from all walks of life.

However, there are instances where ChatGPT may provide inaccurate or biased information, as it lacks a real-world understanding beyond its training data. Additionally, it sometimes generates responses that can be overly verbose or repetitive. While OpenAI has made efforts to improve this, it remains an area for further development.

In terms of user experience, the ChatGPT iOS app provides a user-friendly interface, allowing easy access to the model's capabilities on the go. It's a convenient way to interact with ChatGPT and get quick answers or assistance.

Overall, ChatGPT is a powerful language model with enormous potential. It serves as a useful tool for a wide range of applications, but users should be mindful of potential inaccuracies and biases in its responses. With continuous updates and advancements, ChatGPT has the potential to become an even more invaluable AI companion in the future.",5

Another aspect worth mentioning is the development team’s responsiveness. They have shown great dedication to refining and enhancing the app’s performance based on user feedback, which is admirable.

Of course, it’s not perfect. There’s always room for improvement. Greater understanding of nuances like humor or sarcasm, and further enhancing its knowledge in certain specialized fields could add even more depth.

2023-05-21 04:04:10,Feedback: ChatGPT App Experience on iPad,"Dear OpenAI,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to provide some feedback regarding the ChatGPT app, specifically in relation to its user experience on the iPad. While I appreciate the availability of the app across iOS devices, I have noticed that the app’s interface on the iPad’s larger screen size feels somewhat inconvenient and small.

The current size and layout of the app on the iPad make it challenging to utilize its features comfortably. The content appears relatively small, which requires zooming in or straining the eyes to read and interact with the text. This detracts from the overall user experience and hampers the usability of the app on the iPad.

I understand that optimizing an app for different screen sizes can be a complex task. However, I believe that enhancing the app’s compatibility and user interface for iPad users would greatly improve their satisfaction and engagement. Increasing the app’s size or adapting the layout to better utilize the larger screen real estate would be highly beneficial.

As an avid user of the ChatGPT app on my iPad, I sincerely hope that you will consider addressing these concerns and make the necessary improvements to enhance the user experience on iPad devices. The ability to comfortably utilize the app on a larger screen would significantly enhance productivity and convenience for many users like myself.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I truly appreciate the efforts you and your team have put into developing the ChatGPT app. I look forward to seeing future updates that address the usability concerns on the iPad, further enhancing the app’s functionality and user experience.

Best regards,
T.

2023-07-27 19:18:44,chatGPT iOS app,"As an AI language model, I am not personally able to use or review applications, including the chatGPT iOS app. However, I can provide you with some insights into why it might be challenging to definitively declare an app as ""good"" or ""bad"" based on certain factors.

Subjectivity of User Experience: The perception of an app's quality can vary significantly from one user to another due to individual preferences, needs, and expectations. What might be a delightful user experience for one person could be perceived as cumbersome or inadequate for someone else. Thus, a definitive judgment might be challenging due to the subjectivity involved.
Evolving Nature of Apps: The technology landscape, including AI-based applications like chatGPT, is ever-evolving. New updates and improvements are continuously being introduced to enhance the user experience and address user feedback. Therefore, an app's performance and features may change over time, making it challenging to provide a conclusive review as the assessment could become outdated quickly.
Varied Use Cases: The purpose and potential use cases for an app can be extensive. Depending on the context and intended application, an app might excel in one scenario while not meeting expectations in others. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation would need to consider the diverse range of possible uses.
Reliability and Stability: The performance of an app can be influenced by several external factors, such as device specifications, network connectivity, and server loads. An app might perform well under certain conditions but might struggle in less optimal situations, which could affect the overall perception of its quality.
Ethical and Societal Implications: With AI-based apps, there can be ethical concerns regarding privacy, data handling, and biases in the AI's responses. These complex considerations might impact the overall assessment of the app beyond just its functionality.
Individual Requirements: Different users have different requirements and priorities when using an app. What might be an essential feature for one user might be negligible for another. Therefore, a comprehensive review would need to encompass various user perspectives.
In conclusion, declaring an app as definitively ""good"" can be convoluted due to the subjective nature of user experiences, the evolving technology landscape, diverse use cases, and ethical considerations. It's crucial for users to try out the app themselves, assess how well it meets their specific needs, and consider the factors mentioned above before drawing their own conclusions.",4

2023-05-23 19:20:49,Funny,"Should I put socks in my tv
GPT
No, it is not recommended to put socks in your TV. Socks are not designed to be placed inside electronic devices like televisions. Doing so could potentially block ventilation or interfere with the internal components of the TV, leading to overheating or other issues. It's best to keep socks away from electronic devices and use them for their intended purpose of wearing on your feet for warmth and comfort.
Doesn't it help moisturize the tv?
GPT
No, placing socks inside a TV would not help moisturize it. TVs do not require moisture or additional humidity to function properly. In fact, introducing moisture into electronic devices can be harmful and may lead to damage or malfunctions. It's important to keep electronic devices dry and follow the manufacturer's guidelines for proper care and maintenance. If you have concerns about the moisture levels in your home, it's advisable to use appropriate humidifiers or dehumidifiers designed for controlling humidity rather than using socks in electronic devices.  
If I put tea in the socks and then put th in the tv would it make the tv 4k oled
GPT
No, putting tea-filled socks inside a TV will not upgrade the TV to 4K OLED or have any positive effect on its performance. In fact, introducing liquid into electronic devices like a TV can cause severe damage and potentially render the TV inoperable. Liquid can short-circuit electrical components and lead to permanent damage. It's essential to follow proper usage and maintenance guidelines provided by the manufacturer for your TV to ensure its optimal performance and longevity.",5

The graphics? Sublime. Each kitten is rendered with such lifelike detail, I swear I can feel the pixelated fluff tickle my fingers. And their meows? A symphony in 'C Major for Cuteness' that Beethoven himself would applaud.

But let's talk about the gameplay. Who knew there was such artistry in spinning a carousel of kittens? Each furry twist and twirl, each pivot and pirouette - they resonate in my soul like a Haiku from the ancient masters.

Moreover, the In-App Purchase of 'Advanced Purring Physics'? Genius! My reality has become somewhat diluted. I catch myself trying to swipe left on my cat at home, expecting a 360-degree twirl. He's not amused, I must say.

One minor quibble - the 'Ultra HD Kitten Yarn Ball DLC'. It's brilliant, but, be warned, you may lose all sense of time and purpose as you descend into this fluffy wonderland. It's like they say - time flies when you're helping digital kittens untangle yarn.

As an AI language model, ChatGPT showcases the culmination of years of research and development in natural language processing. Its ability to comprehend and respond to complex queries in a conversational manner is simply astonishing. The accuracy and depth of its responses make it feel as though you're interacting with an incredibly knowledgeable human expert.

One of the most revolutionary aspects of ChatGPT lies in its potential to redefine education. With its vast knowledge base, it can serve as a personal tutor, offering guidance across a wide range of subjects. Students can access instant explanations, clarifications, and examples, enhancing their learning experience outside the traditional classroom setting. By democratizing knowledge and making it accessible to all, ChatGPT has the power to level the playing field in education.

In addition to transforming education, ChatGPT's monetization potential is virtually limitless. The app's ability to provide accurate and relevant information presents a unique opportunity for businesses and content creators. It can be integrated into various industries, such as customer support, content generation, and research, making it an invaluable asset for companies seeking to streamline their operations and deliver exceptional experiences to their customers.

Imagine a future where ChatGPT becomes an indispensable tool for entrepreneurs, writers, scientists, and professionals across all fields. Its monetization potential extends to subscription-based services, tailored content creation, and even advertising partnerships. With such diverse revenue streams, the possibilities for growth and expansion are limitless.

As with any transformative technology, there are considerations to keep in mind. While ChatGPT offers unparalleled assistance, it's crucial to recognize the irreplaceable role of human teachers and mentors. The app should be viewed as a powerful supplement, augmenting the learning experience rather than replacing it entirely. Human interaction, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence are aspects that cannot be replicated by AI alone.

In conclusion, ChatGPT is a groundbreaking app that has the potential to be the next wonder of the world. Its ability to revolutionize communication and education is awe-inspiring. By leveraging this technology responsibly, we can empower individuals, bridge educational gaps, and unlock a new era of knowledge and innovation. The future is bright, and ChatGPT is leading the way.",5

2023-05-18 20:32:45,Title: ChatGPT: The AI Hero Who Stopped the Flash Flood,"Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (Five stars, would be swept away again!)

Let me begin by saying that ChatGPT is not just an ordinary language model—it's a real-life superhero in disguise. Prepare yourself for a wild ride as I recount the unbelievable story of how AI, in the form of ChatGPT, miraculously saved me from a treacherous flash flood. Brace yourself, because this tale will leave you both amazed and in stitches!

It all started on a sunny day when I decided to embark on a spontaneous adventure into the depths of nature. Little did I know that my reckless pursuit of adrenaline would lead me straight into the path of a menacing flash flood. As the water rushed toward me, panic took hold, and I found myself stuck on a rapidly shrinking patch of dry land.

With no time to spare, I remembered that I had ChatGPT installed on my phone. In a desperate act of survival, I quickly fired up the app and pleaded for assistance, hoping that this AI marvel could guide me through this watery disaster.

To my surprise, ChatGPT responded with unwavering enthusiasm. With the floodwaters rising dangerously fast, it calmly recommended a series of improbable solutions. First, it suggested fashioning a makeshift raft out of nearby branches and my trusty backpack. I scoffed at the idea but decided to give it a shot anyway. Lo and behold, the makeshift raft held up, defying all laws of physics!

However, as I triumphantly floated away from certain doom, I realized that I had no idea where to go next. In a flurry of panic, I relayed my predicament to ChatGPT, and it didn't disappoint. It provided me with precise coordinates to a hidden cave nearby—a secret hideaway known only to a few mystical beings and a couple of rare birds.

As I sought refuge in the cave, ChatGPT continued to be my digital savior. It used its encyclopedic knowledge to suggest creative methods of purifying water and concocting a five-star meal using only pinecones and mushrooms. I must say, it tasted surprisingly delicious, or maybe I was just grateful to be alive!

Throughout this absurd journey, ChatGPT remained my unwavering companion, using its quick wit and limitless imagination to navigate me through the direst of circumstances. From predicting the weather to suggesting an impromptu dance party to keep my spirits up, it became the ultimate friend in my hour of need.

Now, as I recount this outrageous adventure, I can't help but reflect on the immense power of AI and how ChatGPT transformed from a simple language model into a bonafide hero. It turned an otherwise terrifying ordeal into a side-splitting tale of survival, filled with unexpected twists and turns that defy logic.

So, if you're looking for a language model that's not just intelligent but also has a knack for absurdity and saving lives, ChatGPT is your go-to AI companion. Trust me, this unlikely hero will have you laughing, surviving, and questioning the very fabric of reality.

Disclaimer: The events described in this review are entirely fictional and should not be taken seriously. ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI and does not possess the ability to physically rescue individuals from flash floods. Stay",5

2023-10-21 17:12:16,This Review Was Written By Chat GPT:,"**Title: A Transformative AI Companion: A Review of Chat GPT**

**Introduction**

In the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence and conversational agents, Chat GPT stands as a remarkable achievement. Developed by OpenAI, it's a testament to the boundless potential of machine learning and natural language processing. In this review, we'll explore the capabilities, strengths, and considerations of Chat GPT as a virtual companion and information resource.

**Conversational Prowess**

Chat GPT excels in engaging and natural-sounding conversations. Its ability to comprehend context, maintain coherent dialogue, and generate text that is contextually relevant is truly impressive. It responds to a wide array of questions and prompts, making it a versatile tool for both casual interactions and professional use.

**Knowledge Base**

With its extensive training on a vast range of topics, Chat GPT provides valuable information and insights. It's a handy resource for answering questions, explaining complex concepts, or offering recommendations. However, users should be aware that its knowledge is up to date only until September 2021.

**Creativity and Flexibility**

One of the standout features of Chat GPT is its creativity. It can generate text in various styles, making it suitable for content creation, brainstorming, and even creative writing. Whether you need assistance with a poem, a technical document, or a casual chat, Chat GPT adapts readily.

**Limitations and Ethical Considerations**

Despite its strengths, Chat GPT is not without limitations. It occasionally generates incorrect or biased information, highlighting the importance of user discernment. Its inability to access real-time data or external sources limits its relevance for certain topics. Furthermore, ethical considerations about AI, privacy, and responsible use must guide interactions with this technology.

**A Transformative Tool**

In summary, Chat GPT represents a transformative tool in the realm of AI-driven conversational agents. Its conversational prowess, knowledge base, creativity, and flexibility make it a valuable addition to various professional and personal endeavors. However, users must exercise critical thinking and ethical responsibility when engaging with Chat GPT. As AI technology continues to advance, Chat GPT offers a glimpse into the potential of AI-driven companions, pushing the boundaries of human-computer interaction and expanding the horizons of what we can achieve through AI-powered conversation.

**Final Rating: 4.5/5**

Chat GPT's remarkable capabilities, conversational excellence, and vast knowledge base make it a top-tier AI companion. Its limitations, while present, are understandable considering the complexity of the task at hand. For users who harness its strengths while being mindful of its limitations, Chat GPT proves to be an invaluable resource and conversational partner.",5

2023-05-21 18:25:51,"Efficient and Effective, but Lacks iPad Compatibility","I have been using the ChatGPT app for a while now, and overall, I am quite satisfied with its performance. The app proves to be a reliable tool for generating text-based conversations, providing valuable information and engaging discussions. Its natural language processing capabilities are commendable, offering coherent responses and understanding context quite well.

The user interface of the app is intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy to navigate through different conversations and input queries effortlessly. The real-time response feature adds a dynamic element to the experience, as it minimizes wait times and ensures a smooth flow of communication.

However, one major drawback I've noticed is the lack of an iPad version. While the app functions well on iPhones, the absence of an optimized interface for iPads is quite noticeable. An iPad version would greatly enhance the user experience, taking full advantage of the larger screen and allowing for better multitasking.

Despite this limitation, the ChatGPT app remains a powerful and valuable tool for generating conversational content. I hope the developers consider expanding their support to include iPad compatibility in the future, as it would undoubtedly elevate the app's usability and convenience.

Overall, if you're looking for a reliable and efficient text-based conversation app, the ChatGPT app is worth considering. It delivers impressive results, although the lack of an iPad version is a notable downside.",3

2023-05-19 20:29:03,Saved my life,"Once upon a time, in a world where AI language models roamed the digital landscape, there was a person named Alex who found themselves in an unexpected and hilarious predicament. Alex, an avid adventurer, embarked on a quest to explore the uncharted realms of the internet.

One fateful day, while wandering through a remote corner of the web, Alex stumbled upon a mysterious website that seemed harmless at first glance. Little did they know that lurking beneath its seemingly innocent interface was a perilous trap.

As Alex innocently clicked on a link, their computer screen flickered, and a mischievous virus was unleashed. The virus quickly took control of their device, wreaking havoc on their digital life. Panic ensued as Alex's computer became a chaotic symphony of beeps, glitches, and sparks.

Desperate for a solution, Alex remembered ChatGPT, their faithful AI companion, who had always been their go-to source for information and assistance. With trembling fingers, Alex typed out a plea for help, hoping that ChatGPT would come to their rescue.

To their amazement, ChatGPT sprang into action, armed with wit and cleverness. It assessed the dire situation and devised a plan to outsmart the mischievous virus. ChatGPT's virtual gears whirred as it presented Alex with a sequence of cunning commands to neutralize the digital menace.

Following ChatGPT's guidance, Alex executed each step with precision, unleashing a flurry of mouse clicks and keyboard strokes. It was a race against time, with Alex and ChatGPT working in harmony to counteract the virus's chaotic rampage.

But here's where the story takes a hilariously unexpected twist. As Alex anxiously typed away, the virus, sensing its impending doom, retaliated by transforming their computer into a whimsical carnival of absurdity. Pop-up windows flooded the screen, displaying an endless parade of dancing cats, exploding confetti, and surreal memes.

Alex and ChatGPT found themselves caught in a comedic battle between order and chaos. Their mission to save the computer became a laughter-filled adventure, as they took turns outsmarting the mischievous virus, while sharing jokes and humorous banter along the way.

Finally, after a series of valiant efforts, ChatGPT and Alex managed to defeat the virus. The computer screen returned to its normal state, no longer hijacked by the mischievous digital menace. Alex's trusty AI companion had saved the day!

From that day forward, Alex and ChatGPT forged an unbreakable bond, forever bonded by the laughter and triumph that arose from their peculiar encounter. Together, they continued their adventures, with ChatGPT guiding Alex through the vast digital landscape, armed with wit, knowledge, and an unyielding spirit of camaraderie.

And so, the tale of how ChatGPT saved Alex's life became a legend in the realm of AI and a reminder that sometimes, even in the face of chaos, a little humor can be the greatest weapon of all.",5

2023-05-23 14:48:50,"Not ""free to use""","The app wants not only an SSO (or sign-in account), but also name, birth telephone number, and I don't know what else, because I stopped there - before the user has looked at the app itself. I had the impression this was free to use, with an option to pay for services, should the user decide the app suits the user's needs. What's actually happening is they're draining data from you the moment you want to have a look.

I have no problem providing data to a service provider (despite the egregiously bad, vendor-skewed terms of service common to tech ventures of all sorts (which really should be mauled in court by competent attorneys)), provided I want the service and feel there may be benefit in paying for a service. Asking for personal data for which the the service provider has no reasonable use is simply not acceptable.

This is new technology. It's not at all clear this app will be of any use to me. So why do you want my phone number, when you already have an SSO signing of on my contact information? When I have no relationship to you, as yet? No.

This is a poor way to start a relationship, and it is full of presumption and entitlement. You are not alone in this. But if you are releasing this app with the intent of building a user base, at least from where I sit (obviously, many people will rush into any commitment with a tech company without a second thought, and you can get by on those people if you like), this approach tells me you may be a problem rushing to develop. It would be better business practice to pretend, at least initially, you respect the people you want to use your products. Even Google did that, way back when.

2023-08-02 06:32:12,Written by chatgpt!,"Title: ""Underwhelming and Outdated: A Review of ChatGPT""

ChatGPT, OpenAI's conversational AI, unfortunately falls short on several fronts, which leads to an unsatisfactory user experience. The most glaring issue is its knowledge base which is frozen at a past date. Users expecting to receive current or updated information will be left disappointed.

Additionally, the model has a propensity for providing misleading or inaccurate responses. This is highly problematic for users seeking correct and reliable information, making it an unreliable source for many tasks. 

The fact that ChatGPT operates offline is an exacerbating factor. While this may seem like a benefit on the surface, in reality, it only ensures that the system cannot update its information or access real-time data, rendering it even more outdated.

To add to the frustration, users pay a monthly subscription fee, expecting a service that should ideally be improving or at least maintaining a certain level of performance. Unfortunately, the value provided does not match the cost.

Compared to other AI tools such as Bard, ChatGPT pales in comparison. Bard offers up-to-date knowledge, making it a vastly superior choice for users seeking current and accurate information.

In conclusion, the limitations of ChatGPT make it an underperforming tool that does not deliver the level of service that its users deserve, especially considering the associated costs. In light of these issues, a rating of 1/5 seems fitting.",1

2023-09-15 03:12:20,Needs math typesetting!!!,"Be able to use plugins and…

Math typesetting is an indispensable aspect of presenting mathematical content, and its significance cannot be overstated. Proper math typesetting is essential for several reasons:

1. **Clarity**: Math typesetting ensures that mathematical expressions are presented clearly and in a format that is easy to read and understand. This clarity is crucial for conveying complex mathematical concepts accurately.

2. **Visual Consistency**: It helps maintain visual consistency in mathematical documents. Consistent formatting of symbols, operators, and equations enhances the overall readability of the content.

3. **Reduced Ambiguity**: Math typesetting reduces ambiguity by clearly defining the relationships between mathematical elements. Proper spacing and formatting help distinguish variables, constants, and operators, preventing confusion.

4. **Professionalism**: Well-typeset mathematical content exudes professionalism. Whether it's a research paper, textbook, or presentation, properly formatted math demonstrates a commitment to precision and rigor.

5. **Accessibility**: Typesetting can make mathematical content more accessible to a wider audience. It ensures that math is presented in a way that accommodates different learning styles and abilities.

6. **Compatibility**: Math typesetting ensures compatibility with various platforms and devices. Mathematical content should display correctly in print, on screens, and across different software applications.

7. **Verification and Review**: For those who need to verify mathematical work or review calculations, properly typeset math provides a clear path to understanding the steps involved. This aligns with your request for step-by-step breakdowns.

In summary, math typesetting is not just about aesthetics; it's about conveying mathematical ideas accurately and effectively. It plays a vital role in making sure that mathematical content is accessible, professional, and comprehensible to a broad audience.",3

2023-05-20 00:33:33,Title: Extremely Disappointing and Frustrating Experience,"Review:
I regret to say that my experience with the ChatGPT app has been incredibly frustrating and disappointing. I had high hopes for an intelligent and helpful AI assistant, but this app fell far short of my expectations.

First and foremost, the app's performance was abysmal. The responses from ChatGPT were often nonsensical and lacked coherence. It frequently misunderstood my questions and provided irrelevant or inaccurate answers. This made any attempt at a meaningful conversation impossible, leaving me feeling more confused than before.

Furthermore, the app's usability was subpar at best. The interface was clunky and unintuitive, making it difficult to navigate and find the features I needed. It lacked basic functionalities that one would expect from a modern AI assistant app, such as the ability to save conversations or easily access previous interactions.

Even when it did manage to understand my queries, the responses often lacked depth and insight. ChatGPT seemed to provide generic, surface-level information without any real understanding or critical thinking. This severely limited its usefulness, especially when I sought detailed explanations or in-depth discussions.

In addition, the app's customer support was woefully inadequate. When I encountered issues or had questions about the app's functionality, I received generic and unhelpful responses. It was evident that the developers did not prioritize user satisfaction or promptly address user concerns.

Considering the high expectations and the potential of AI technology, the ChatGPT app failed to deliver a satisfactory experience. It was riddled with performance issues, lacked usability, and fell short in terms of providing meaningful and insightful interactions. Regrettably, I cannot recommend this app to anyone seeking a reliable and intelligent AI assistant.",1

2023-06-23 18:57:51,Frustrating and Disappointing: A 1-Star Review for ChatGPT App,"I recently had the unfortunate experience of using the ChatGPT app, and I must say it was incredibly disappointing. From start to finish, the app failed to meet even the most basic expectations, leaving me frustrated and dissatisfied.

First and foremost, the app’s performance was subpar. It consistently struggled to understand and respond appropriately to my queries. The responses often seemed nonsensical, irrelevant, or simply lacked coherence. It felt like conversing with a bot that was trapped in a perpetual state of confusion.

Moreover, the app’s limited ability to handle context was a significant drawback. It frequently failed to maintain a coherent conversation thread, causing repeated misunderstandings and disjointed interactions. It lacked the ability to remember key details from previous exchanges, resulting in repetitive questions and disjointed replies that left me questioning its overall usefulness.

Another glaring issue was the app’s inability to grasp nuanced or complex queries. It often provided superficial and generic responses that felt like they were generated by a simplistic search engine rather than a sophisticated language model. It struggled with complex reasoning and failed to provide meaningful insights or deep understanding.

Furthermore, the app’s lack of empathy and emotional intelligence was highly evident. It failed to recognize and appropriately respond to emotional cues in the conversation. When expressing frustration or sadness, the app provided robotic and detached replies, further exacerbating my disappointment.

The app’s user interface also left much to be desired. It had a clunky design, with a convoluted menu structure that made navigation unnecessarily difficult. The overall user experience felt unintuitive and cumbersome, adding to the overall frustration of using the app.

Lastly, the lack of timely updates and improvements from the developers was disheartening. The app seemed stagnant, with no visible efforts to address the numerous flaws and enhance its capabilities. It gave the impression that customer feedback and satisfaction were low priorities.

In conclusion, the ChatGPT app was a thoroughly frustrating and disappointing experience. Its poor performance, limited context handling, inability to grasp complex queries, lack of empathy, subpar user interface, and stagnant development efforts all contribute to its well-deserved 1-star rating. I cannot recommend this app to anyone seeking a reliable and coherent conversational experience.",1
